</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">382 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE threat of a triple-dip recession in the eurozone, civil unrest in China and the Ebola crisis have created an unprecedented number of headwinds for the global economy, according to the chief executive of WPP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of the world's largest advertising group by sales, said geopolitical risks &quot;continued to multiply&quot; and had hit confidence among major advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WPP posted a lower than expected increase in like-for-like sales of 3pc in the third quarter, slightly below the consensus of 3.3pc and a first-half rise of 4.1pc, and said it expects sales to slow further in the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's general uncertainty surrounding the global economy. Ebola obviously has created uncertainty, the rise of Isil in Syria and most importantly the demonstrations in Hong Kong,&quot; he said. &quot;China is the engine of economic growth and if it sneezes we all catch a cold. I can't remember a time when there's been so many flashpoints. So I think this just adds to the uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;[In the UK] it was the Scottish referendum. Now we have an EU referendum looming if the Conservatives [win the general election], so I think this just raises the temperature of uncertainty and gives people excuses not to do things. And this is against a background of worldwide growth being below trend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir Martin said WPP had also managed to poach &quot;tons&quot; of clients after the collapsed $35bn (&pound;22bn) merger between Publicis and Omnicom, including telecoms giant Vodafone and brewer AB InBev. &quot;Their eyes were off the ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revenue - which the group distinguishes from net sales due to the way it books some income - was up 3.1pc at &pound;2.76bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WPP described stagnant growth and stubbornly low inflation in the eurozone as a &quot;grey swan&quot;, a term Sir Martin has used for forthcoming events that are known about but could still have unknown consequences. However, he said the current weakness could present a buying opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain remained the global bright spot in terms of growth, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm very bullish on the UK, but I do think if we have a referendum it's going to cast a shadow over the UK economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the current recovery was like a &quot;gently rising square root sign&quot;. &quot;Companies are doing well, including ourselves. But it's been a real slog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shares rose 0.8pc &pound;12.18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small talk with other parents outside my four-year-old's school isn't usually difficult. There's the question of how our little youngsters are getting on with their new teacher, and how we parents are juggling the school routine with work. A couple of times recently, though, I've been a bit vague on that latter topic. After all, telling fellow mums and dads that you have just come back from Ebola-hit Liberia is not that easy to drop into casual schoolrun chat. As a conversation-killer, it's up there with saying that rather than trick-or-treating, my daughter and I will be opting for a spot of Satanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before a team of boiler-suited medics beat their path to my house, let me offer a few words of reassurance. I've been to Liberia twice in the last few months, both times reporting on the Ebola outbreak, and yes, it does involve a certain risk. But like other important stories, such as Syria and Iraq, my editor thinks that it's worth taking those risks to keep the public informed. Without the first-hand reports showing people dying outside treatment centres, the response to the crisis might not have been as big as it is now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difference is, of course, that with Ebola, those risks follow you home in a way that bullets, bombs and kidnappers never do. Had I become infected while out there, I could potentially have brought the virus back, and then possibly passed it on to my family and other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luckily, it doesn't quite work that way. While Ebola does have a three-week incubation period, carriers of the virus are only a danger to others once the symptoms start, and even then, the infectiousness is limited in the early stages. The advice from Public Health England, with whom I am obliged to register, is that until that happens, one is fine to continue life as normal - going to work, dropping children off at school, seeing friends, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, it's one thing to sound reassuring in print. It's quite another to reassure parents in a playground, many of whom may still take the view that it is better to be safe than sorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is a price to be paid for erring on the side of caution - as is demonstrated by the case this week of Kaci Hickox, an American volunteer with Medicins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res, who has threatened to sue US officials in New Jersey after they tried to have her compulsorily quarantined when she came back from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. On Thursday, she openly defied them, going for a bike ride in front of the assembled media (some of them following so closely that it was clear they didn't consider her an infection risk).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Hickox's stance has thrown America's rulers into disarray. Siding with her are the White House and disease control experts, who point out that not only is forced quarantine unnecessary, but the stigma and inconvenience also risk deterring aid workers from helping in West Africa. Bitterly critical of her are the likes of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who says that Ebola is too dangerous a threat to count on a &quot;voluntary&quot; system of quarantine. The public, meanwhile, are divided, partly according to whether they see aid workers as selfless heroes who need protection, or as Leftie do-gooders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a journalist for this newspaper, I don't really fall into either category. But I can't help sympathising with Ms Hickox. The first three weeks after coming back from Ebola-land are stressful enough as they are - if one gets a headache, severe cold or attack of the runs, there is always that sneaking worry that it might be something worse. The last thing one needs on top of that is to be treated like some sort of leper - which does happen anyway, albeit most often due to ignorance about the real risks of contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One British public health expert who was out in Sierra Leone recently made a point of saying during a BBC radio interview that he had gone straight back to work the day after returning home. That, however, did not stop the BBC from deciding that it wasn't safe to send a crew to interview him face to face. If they'd said that to a person with HIV, there would have been an outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately, Britain has so far steered clear of the kind of compulsory quarantines favoured by New Jersey, although that's partly because we have so far been spared the kind of Ebola scares that might lead to calls for such measures. Should one happen, though - and I suspect it will - I can only hope that an over-the-top 'elf and safety culture doesn't prevail. We rightly protest when that attitude stops villages holding fetes or children throwing snowballs. We should also protest if it gets in the way of aid workers going out to save lives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE American nurse at the centre of a national battle over quarantine rules for health workers returning from west Africa yesterday won the latest round in her fight not to be forced into three weeks of isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A judge in Maine rejected a request by the state to impose a mandatory quarantine order on Kaci Hickox in a ruling that was being closely followed by politicians and heath chiefs across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox, who has showed no Ebola symptoms and twice tested negative for the disease, had refused to agree to a voluntary home quarantine during the 21-day incubation period since returning home from treating Ebola patients for an aid agency in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Charles LaVerdiere had initially imposed a temporary order requiring Miss Hickox to keep three feet away from people and to avoid public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But after hearing arguments from lawyers for the state and Miss Hickox and evidence from a health expert, he lifted those restrictions ahead of a full hearing to be held on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This decision has critical implication for [Miss Hickox's] freedom, as guaranteed by the US and Maine constitutions, as well as the public's right to be protected from the potential severe harm posed by transmission of this devastating disease,&quot; he noted in a written ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining his decision, he said that the state &quot;has not met its burden at this time to prove by clear and convincing evidence&quot; that limiting her movements was &quot;necessary to protect other individuals from the dangers of infection&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did order that she take part in daily &quot;direct active monitoring&quot; of her health with state officials, keep the authorities informed of any travel plans and immediately report any Ebola symptoms. Miss Hickox has agreed to those conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Soley, the lawyer who represented Miss Hickox in court, hailed the ruling as a victory, noting that she was already following the requirements laid down by the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state police patrol cars that had been stationed outside her home in Fort Kent left within an hour of a ruling that meant that Miss Hickox could move freely in the town. Many residents of the small logging community near the Canadian border had expressed anger at her refusal to follow a voluntary quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their concerns were doubtless deepened as the court also heard that an unnamed room-mate of Miss Hickox in Sierra Leone - presumed to be a foreign health worker - had contracted Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul LePage, the governor of Maine, made clear his disappointment with the ruling but said he would not block Miss Hickox's movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite our best effort to work collaboratively with this individual, she has refused to cooperate with us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As governor, I have done everything I can to protect the health and safety of Mainers. The judge has eased restrictions with this ruling and I believe it is unfortunate. However, the state will abide by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox argued that quarantine restrictions would violate her rights and discourage other aid workers from volunteering to tackle Ebola in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confrontation has become the focal point of a struggle between several US states opting for stringent measures and a federal government wary of discouraging potential medical volunteers to combat the outbreak. Aid agencies said that the fight had already deterred doctors and nurses from signing up as volunteers because they were worried about losing an additional three weeks of work and being shunned when they returned from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have seen a big deterrence,&quot; said Margaret Aguirre, of the International Medical Corps. &quot;People are worried. They don't want to sign up. Hopefully smarter minds will come to the front.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Oxford academic has pulled out of a conference on Ebola and tropical diseases in New Orleans after falling foul of strict quarantine rules. Piero Olliaro, a visiting fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford, was due to present several papers about his research on malaria and river blindness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he was among a dozen experts who had to withdraw after Louisiana said anyone who has been in the west African countries hit by Ebola in the past three weeks would be confined to their hotel rooms. Dr Piero was in Guinea two weeks ago trying to find a site for testing Ebola medication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN OTHER circumstances, it would just have been a young woman taking a bicycle ride with her boyfriend along quiet country lanes through the autumnal splendour of northern Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaci Hickox was followed on her foray by two police cars and a posse of journalists as she defied a quarantine request from the state government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox is the nurse who has returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone showing no symptoms of the disease and is refusing to follow a voluntary home quarantine order requested by Maine for the 21-day incubation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her stand has earned her withering criticism from some neighbours in the small logging town of Fort Kent and put her at the centre of a political, medical and legal debate about how to handle not just Ebola patients but also US health care volunteers returning from the &quot;hot zones&quot; of West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following her bike ride, Paul LePage, Maine's Republican governor, said that negotiations &quot;have failed&quot; and he was understood to have asked a judge to impose a mandatory quarantine on public health grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox, an aid agency volunteer, has said that she will fight any such ruling through the courts and is already represented by two prominent New York civil liberties lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 33-year-old has twice tested negative for Ebola and is monitoring herself for any symptoms of illness, including fever. Medical experts say that it is impossible for anyone to be contagious if they do not have symptoms and even then the disease can only be transmitted at close proximity by bodily fluids. &quot;I am not going to sit around and be bullied by politicians and forced to stay in my home when I am not a risk to the American public,&quot; she said. She argued that &quot;stigmatising&quot; and isolating returning health workers would deter their much-needed travel to Africa and would only fuel irrational fears about how Ebola spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Fort Kent, an isolated community near the Canadian border, there is little sympathy for those principles. &quot;It's causing consternation here,&quot; said Jim Majka. &quot;It's a simple thing. Stay in quarantine until it's over and she's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Hickox came to national prominence when she was forcibly quarantined in a medical tent outside a New Jersey hospital after flying into Newark airport. The state's combative governor Chris Christie reluctantly sanctioned her release after she threatened to sue him. She does seem to have some backing from President Barack Obama. He has warned that the imposition of overly restrictive measures on returning health workers would undermine American interests by discouraging others from tackling the crisis in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know that the best way to protect Americans from Ebola is to stop the outbreak at its source,&quot; he said during an appearance with US health workers, some of whom have also returned from the region within the last 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chuck Hagel, the defence secretary, ordered that all US troops deployed to support the fight against Ebola in Africa must undergo a mandatory 21-day quarantine on their return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine suffered defeat in its attempts to restrict the movements of a nurse who returned to the state after working with Ebola patients in west Africa, when a judge reversed an earlier ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Maine judge on Friday ruled that Kaci Hickox must comply with monitoring for Ebola symptoms, but lifted an order that she stay away from public gatherings and maintain a 3ft distance from others, though those requirements had complied with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for people in a situation like hers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Maine] has not met its burden at this time to prove by clear and convincing evidence that limiting [Hickox's] movements to the degree requested is 'necessary to protect other individuals from the dangers of infection',&quot; chief district court judge Charles C LaVerdiere wrote in an order posted on Friday afternoon. &quot;[Hickox] currently does not show any symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not infectious.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LaVerdiere had previously issued a temporary order restricting Hickox's movements. Maine officials initially attempted to quarantine Hickox in her home until 10 November, despite the fact that she has shown no symptoms of Ebola and has twice tested negative for the disease, but they backed down after Hickox threatened legal action and hired two civil rights attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very satisfied with the decision,&quot; Hickox said at a press conference after LaVerdiere's ruling. &quot;The three points he is recommending I abide by are three points I still believe are part of this good compromise I believe we can make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full hearing of Hickox's case is scheduled for 4 and 5 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was stopped at Newark Liberty airport a week ago after she arrived from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for Doctors Without Borders caring for Ebola patients. Sierra Leone is one of the three west African countries hit hardest by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary order had required Hickox to abide by guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But the judge's Friday ruling rolled back several of those requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Hickox still must comply with health department monitoring, taking her temperature twice a day and reporting any symptoms, but she doesn't have to avoid public places. She still must coordinate travel with health officials so her monitoring isn't interrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,&quot; LaVerdiere wrote. &quot;However, whether that fear is rational or not, it is present and it is real. [Hickox's] actions at this point, as a healthcare professional, need to demonstrate her full understanding of human nature and the real fear that exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials wanted to restrict Hickox's movements to the town of Fort Kent where she lives, bar her from public gatherings and force her to stay 3ft away from others. Governor Paul LePage, who is currently in a tight election race for his job, had also called Thursday for her to be subject to another blood test. Hickox didn't say whether she would go into town, but said she is &quot;taking things minute by minute,&quot; and that she didn't &quot;want to make anyone uncomfortable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox became the center of a debate on how to treat healthcare workers returning from Ebola-ravaged west African countries after she was detained in Newark, New Jersey. There, she was questioned for hours, and eventually quarantined in a tent outside a hospital with a portable toilet and no shower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey governor Chris Christie backed down on his pledge to keep healthcare workers, and Hickox in particular, in a 21-day quarantine, after she threatened legal action. New Jersey released Hickox on Monday and she was transported via private car more than 600 miles to Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Hickox was in Fort Kent, a town of about 4,100 people near the Canadian border, Maine officials attempted to place her under similar 21-day quarantine measures. The nurse publicly criticized authorities' efforts, arguing the measures infringed on her civil liberties and that such measures weren't grounded in good science. People infected with the Ebola virus are only contagious when they are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and [have] tried to resolve this amicably, but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public, even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,&quot; said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the week, Hickox told authorities she would leave her home if she couldn't reach an agreement with the state, and on Thursday she went for a one-mile bike ride with her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was the first healthcare worker who states attempted to subject to movement restrictions. The measures have been criticized by medical professionals and aid organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States announced heightened restrictions after a New York City doctor was diagnosed with Ebola following his work with patients in west Africa, where the disease has killed nearly 5,000 people. Health officials disclosed after New York City doctor Craig Spencer's diagnosis that he'd traveled around the city of 8.4 million people, going on a three-mile jog, bowling, and taking the subway. Spencer is being treated at Bellevue hospital in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Hickox will remain in Fort Kent, where local residents and officials have had mixed reactions. The police department has fielded almost 40 calls per day about her, about half of which are from concerned citizens, some from out of state. Other locals have supported Hickox, even delivering her a pizza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Hickox says she just wants to relax with her boyfriend. &quot;Tonight, I am going to try to convince Ted to make my favorite Japanese meal, and I think we're going to watch a scary movie.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle to contain the Ebola outbreak has pushed global health into the spotlight. While much has been said about the world's slow response to the crisis, focus has also shifted to the broken health systems that contributed to the epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our latest Global development podcast explores the lessons the Ebola outbreak can teach us about global health inequality, looking at the weaknesses in the current response, the shortfall in global health spending, and the actions required to prevent further outbreaks. The Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, spoke to Dr Marie-Paule Kieny of the World Health Organisation, along with Professor David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Oxfam's Mohga Kamal-Yanni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kieny said it was not enough simply to rebuild the health systems weakened by Ebola; leaders should instead rethink how health sectors operate in developing countries, she argued. &quot;It does definitely need a new way of thinking, not just at a national level but at a global level,&quot; said Kieny. &quot;The worry is that once Ebola goes from the headlines, then we're back to square one until we have the next outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to know what you think. Could the Ebola outbreak be the tipping point for addressing wider global health problems?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What's the story?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Africa is experiencing the biggest outbreak of the Ebola virus ever known, causing thousands of deaths, devastating fragile healthcare systems and damaging the economies of countries, some of which are still recovering from civil war. Infections are thought to be doubling every few weeks. The WHO says there were 13,700 officially registered cases by the end of October, almost all in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, with about 5,000 deaths, but many go unrecorded and the true figure is thought to be two to three times higher. The US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) says that if nothing changes there could be 1.4 million cases by late January. Liberia has shown a slight drop in the numbers, but the WHO has warned this could be temporary. Concerns for countries bordering the epidemic region intensified when a child died of Ebola in Mali, having travelled while sick for hundreds of miles by bus. Outside Africa, two nurses were infected while caring for a patient in Texas who flew from Liberia before exhibiting symptoms, as was a nurse who treated a missionary repatriated to Madrid. The patients died but the nurses recovered. A doctor returning to New York from Liberia also fell sick and triggered new 21-day quarantine restrictions in some states.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">How this happened</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its beginnings in southern Guinea in December 2013, Ebola has spread with lethal effect across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been cases in Nigeria and Senegal. As of 29 October, the WHO put the number of cases as 13,703 and deaths at 4,920 but the figures are uncertain and the true fatality rate is 70%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola outbreaks in the past have generally been in remote rural areas with swift action to isolate the victims able to contain them. The WHO has been criticised for not reacting fast enough to the outbreak: it took three months to diagnose the first cases, and five months more before a public health emergency was declared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial for the New England Journal of Medicine by Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, and Peter Piot, the head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the exceptional spread of the disease was probably down to a number of factors including dysfunctional health systems, high population mobility across state borders, densely populated capitals and lack of trust in authorities after years of armed conflict meaning health advice is not heeded. Fear is also a factor. People are afraid to go to hospital because they think it may be the source of infection. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The issues</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How the disease spreads                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not an air-borne disease and can only be spread from human to human through close contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the disease - in blood, vomit, semen, urine, tears or saliva. The incubation period - the gap between an individual being infected and showing symptoms - is up to 21 days, meaning it is possible for an infected person to travel widely before they know they have the disease. Humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms, which at first are fever, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function and in some cases internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Death of health workers                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of Ebola through bodily fluids puts health workers dealing with such symptoms as vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding at a high risk. By 27 October, 521 health workers had developed the disease across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, with 272 dead. While pictures of doctors in full body suits and visors treating Ebola patients have been published all over the world, there is in reality not enough protective clothing. The suits are also uncomfortable to wear in hot climates and risk contamination when they are taken off. Most health workers are infected in clinics treating patients they do not know or suspect have Ebola. The first symptoms can resemble malaria, which is common. Some healthcare workers have been staying away from work for fear of the disease, and in Liberia there have been strikes over pay and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     No drugs or vaccine                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, pharmaceutical firms have given Ebola very low priority. Potential drugs and vaccines under development are now being sped into trials. Healthy volunteers in Europe, the US and unaffected African countries have been injected with candidate vaccines to test safety. Three vaccines are expected to be tested in health workers and burial teams at high risk in west Africa in December. Drug trials will soon also be set up there, although there is no certainty that they will work. Stocks of ZMapp, the experimental drug used to treat several international aid workers and medical staff, have run out. That and other drugs are now bring rushed into production, ahead of efficacy data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Healthcare system collapse                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Healthcare in the region was fragile at best before Ebola. Now there is disintegration as staff become ill or stay away for fear of the disease. Infection control and hygiene are major issues. Soap and water are unavailable in some areas. Alcohol hand rubs are needed on a large scale. Isolation facilities are vital to contain Ebola, as are labs for testing because rapid diagnosis is very important. Both are in very short supply. In some places, isolation is nothing more than an area behind a curtain. People with other diseases and women in childbirth are at risk because hospitals are no longer functioning properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       Cultural issues                                          Levels of virus in infected people are highest in the late stage of disease and in dead bodies. The disease has often spread during traditional funeral practices that involve close contact with the corpse. Burial teams in protective clothing are being dispatched to homes to collect and safely dispose of bodies. Another route of transmission has been traditional healing practices, which involve touching. Families are at high risk when they nurse their sick at home, as is traditionally the norm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persuading people to change their cultural practices has been hard. There is little respect for government authority in a region still emerging from civil war and where corruption is rife. Advice that runs counter to cultural practices is resented and in the absence of authority, myth and superstition take over.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">How can I find out more?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheNew England Journal of Medicine published a detailed report written by the WHO's Ebola team to mark nine months since the start of the outbreak. TheWHO itself also produced a compilation of articles in August to mark six months since the first case was formally identified. They examine Ebola's impact on west Africa and warn that without measures to control it, the number of cases will rise fast.M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res provides information on its treatment centres and regular reports from the frontline. The USCentres for Disease Control has information on diagnosis and treatment, and theWorld Bank has put together a report on Ebola's potential economic impact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim they were also told that if they could get photographs of students dressed as Ebola victims or in other controversial outfits, these could make a front-page story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student newspapers that were contacted include the University of Manchester's Mancunian, Bath student newspaper Bath Impact, and Leeds University's The Gryphon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear whether the woman was acting with the knowledge or authority of the Sun. News international have been contacted by the Guardian for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gr&aacute;inne Morrison, one of the editors at the Mancunion, says: &quot;Our editor-in-chief was phoned by a reporter claiming to be from the Sun, who offered him thousands of pounds if he could find a picture of a student dressed up as either &quot;Jihadi John&quot;, a name given to a British member of Isis said to be behind several beheading incidents this year, or Alan Henning, the Salford resident who was killed by Isis at the beginning of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They implied that if we could make that happen, they would reward us and if we wanted to go even further, there would be even more reward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt that it was really shocking and we had to write something about it, because obviously we weren't going to find them a picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison says she and other students at her paper were particularly offended because Alan Henning was from Greater Manchester and his death had been shocking to the student community there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says: &quot;We felt that they were trying to misrepresent students, by trying to get us to send something that would not only make students look bad but that would also be completely insensitive, especially for Manchester students. Manchester students have been very affected by Alan Henning's execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Smith, activities officer at Manchester student union, told the Mancunion: &quot;We strongly condemn this journalistic approach which sought to damage the integrity of both our union and the Mancunion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reputational damage to any individual who does end up on the cover of [a paper] could really affect them, and the paper is showing blatant disregard for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Butcher, a reporter at Bath Impact who was also contacted, says: &quot;A woman claiming to be from the Sun phoned on Wednesday afternoon to ask if we were planning on sending any photographers out to cover Halloween events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were told that pictures of 'Jihadi Johns' would be a front-page story, but Ebola victims would also be good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said a substantial financial reward would be offered. They wanted to portray all students as stupid - based on the actions of a few. We wouldn't want to sell out the whole student body like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the Sun published photos of two University of Chester students who won a nightclub's Halloween fancy-dress competition wearing costumes depicting the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The pair were later forced to apologise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares in Barclays have jumped nearly 8% to 239.9p and Royal Bank of Scotland has risen more than 6% to 388.6p after the Bank of England imposed less stringent requirements on how much capital banks must hold compared to their outstanding loans. My colleague Jill Treanor reports:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Osborne is calling on the Bank of England to consider the impact on lending to business and households as it toughens the regime to bolster the financial strength of the banking sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of England wants major banks to be subjected to a regulatory regime intended to prevent them hiding the risks they are taking when granting loans to households and business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a much-anticipated announcement, the Bank of England is requiring the biggest banks to hold 3p of capital for every &pound;1 they lend out by imposing a 3% leverage ratio across the industry almost immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leverage ratio - a way of measuring the financial strength of banks - does not allow banks to make assessments about the risks they face, unlike the capital ratios which allow an assessment of risk to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threadneedle Street's financial policy committee will consult next year to impose an even higher leverage ratio on the biggest banks - such as Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland - which could push the level up to just above 4% from 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Osborne, who had asked the FPC to conduct the review, said that he &quot;fully accepts&quot; the logic for an extra component to be added to the 3% level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said more work needed to be done on understanding what the impact might be on banks and large building societies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time for a recap, after a rather busier Friday than usual.... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World stock markets have surged after the Bank of Japan raised its monetary stimulus programme in a new attempt to drive inflation upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kurodawarned that Japan has reached a 'critical moment' in its battle against deflation, after announcing that the BoJ will broaden the monetary base by 80 trillion yen per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BoJ will also triple the amount of  exchange traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts it buys, and also buy more long-term Japanese government debt ( the FT has a nice summary ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of more monetary stimulus has cheered investors around the globe. Europe's indices are all sharply higher this afternoon, and Japan's Nikkei earlier leapt by almost 5% to its highest level in seven years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index has hit a new record intraday high in early trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move has also driven the yen down to seven year lows against the US dollar -- it has just hit the &yen;112 to the $1 mark. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treasury announced this morning that it has decided to redeem &pound;218m of war debt. It is also considering repaying &pound;2bn of war debt, as the recent falls in UK borrowing costs make it a profitable move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4% consols&quot; was issued in 1927 by Winston Churchill, then chancellor, to refinance national war bonds originating from the first world war. The Debt Management Office estimates that the nation has paid &pound;1.26bn in interest on these bonds since 1927.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national war bonds, which paid out a rate of interest of 5% initially (cut to 3.5% in 1932), were issued in 1917 as the government sought to raise more money to finance the ongoing cost of the first world war, which started with the issue of the first war loan in November 1914. The bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: &quot;If you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These consols also include some debts dating back to the Crimea War, and losses incurred during the South Sea Bubble.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITV News's Joel Hills has blogged about the plan - here's a flavour:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In value terms the bulk of Britain's First World War bonds are held by big City institutions, but over 100,000 War Bonds are worth less than &pound;1,000 and are held by ordinary members of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases these bonds will have been passed down through the generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their value has been slowly eroded by inflation (&pound;100 in 1914 is worth around &pound;3,000 now) and the returns today are almost derisory (a War Bond of &pound;100 pays out &pound;3.50 in annual interest). But I imagine the sentimental value is immense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda has warned that Japan's battle against deflation has reached a 'critical moment'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at a press conference in Toyko, explaining why BoJ policymakers voted to boost their stimulus programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've taken some key quotes off Reuters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuroda said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is a critical moment for Japan to emerge from deflation. That's why we expanded QQE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's step shows our unwavering determination to end deflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Opinion emerged from the board that we should expand QQE in the process of discussing our semiannual report... The board was split with some doubting whether it was appropriate to take (additional easing) steps now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a pretty drastic step, so I think there will be a significant effect (on the economy). We don't think there is an immediate need to do anything further... but we will make necessary policy adjustments looking at upside, downside risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For now, I think we've done enough to respond to risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuroda also channelled Mario Draghi, his counterpart at the ECB, when discussing inflation expectations, saying the BoJ would do 'whatever it takes' to get the public's inflation expectations up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Japan is different from countries like the United States, which has inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent. Actual price moves have a big impact on inflation expectations. If actual price rises slow, it hurts momentum. There was a risk that despite having made steady progress, we could face a delay in eradicating the public's deflation mindset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important for the BOJ to strongly commit to achieving its price target to get its price target firmly embedded in people's mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've pledged to do whatever it takes to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It won't do much good in trying to shake off the public's deflation mindset if you just say inflation will reach 2 percent some day. We expanded QQE to pre-empt risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good mo rning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big news from Tokyo - the Bank of Japan has bowed to pressure and extended its stimulus programme in a renewed bid to stave off deflation, stunning the markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BoJ policymakers agreed ( narrowly ) to buy more assets with newly created money. They will now aim to widen Japan's monetary based by 80 trillion yen per year, up from the &yen;60t-70 trillion level previously targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also buy more riskier assets, including funds traded on the stock markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BoJ acted after inflation data, released overnight, showed Japan's consumer prices index had fallen for the second year running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern was growing that Japan's bold bid to stimulate inflation and revive the economy was faltering, nearly two years after prime minister Shinzo Abe and BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda had launched radical action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the BoJ said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend and is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential. However, on the price front, somewhat weak developments in demand following the consumption tax hike and a substantial decline in crude oil prices have been exerting downward pressure recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the current downward pressure on prices remains, there is a risk that conversion of deflationary mindset, which has so far been progressing steadily, will be delayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's action is a real surprise, sending shares soaring on the Japanese stock market and weakening the yen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the BoJ was split over the decision - voting 5-4 in favour:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Maine obtained a temporary court order on Friday that places restrictions on the movements of a nurse who worked with Ebola patients in west Africa, but who has not shown any symptoms of the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court order allows Kaci Hickox to leave her home, but she may not go to public gatherings and must maintain a 3ft distance from other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a decision issued on Friday morning, chief district court judge Charles C LaVerdlere wrote that the case had &quot;critical implications for [Hickox's] freedom&quot;, and &quot;the public's right to be protected from the potential severe harm posed by transmission of a devastating disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further hearing will be held to determined the legality of the measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials had wanted to quarantine Hickox in her home until 10 November. Officials backed down after Hickox threatened legal action and hired two civil rights attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was stopped at Newark Liberty airport a week ago after she arrived from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for Doctors Without Borders caring for Ebola patients. Sierra Leone is one of the three west African countries worst affected by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary order requires Hickox to abide by a set of restrictions that largely mirror guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She must stay in Fort Kent, and if she does travel, coordinate with health officials. She will be allowed to go outside, as she did during a bike ride on an isolated road on Thursday, but she must maintain a 3ft distance from others. She may not go to work or attend public gatherings, and must report her temperature and any symptoms to public health officials daily.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight between a Maine nurse under Ebola-quarantine orders and authorities intensified on Thursday, as the nurse defied state orders and went for a bike ride with her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse, Kaci Hickox, has argued that forced 21-day isolation orders are medically unnecessary and violate her civil rights. She has hired two New York City-based attorneys to fight Maine's orders that she stay isolated indoors until 10 November. The governor of Maine said he would back down if she agreed to take a blood test, but the standoff continued on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and tried to resolve this amicably but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,&quot; said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed state troopers have been guarding Hickox's house since Wednesday, standing outside with a huddle of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine state police followed Hickox on her bike ride with boyfriend Ted Wilbur to monitor her interaction with the public. The Associated Press reports that Maine state police cannot arrest Hickox, because they have not obtained a court order to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In an interview with ABC News, Paul LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, said he would back down if Hickox took a blood test. &quot;This could be resolved today. She has been exposed [to Ebola] and she's not cooperative, so force her to take a test. It's so simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor later said negotiations between Hickox's attorneys and the state failed, and he would continue to pursue legal action. In a statement, the governor said he would allow quarantined healthcare workers to &quot;walking or jogging in a park,&quot; but would not allow them to attend public gatherings, travel or come within three feet of others. The state is likely to seek confidentiality on any paperwork it files with local courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse hired attorneys after she was questioned and detained at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey on Friday. Airport officials questioned Hickox for three hours before detecting an elevated temperature with a heat-scanning gun ( which researchers do not consider reliable ), and bringing her to a nearby hospital where she was detained. Hickox was forced to stay in an isolation tent at Newark University hospital until Monday, when the governor of New Jersey agreed to her release. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus can have an incubation period of up to 21 days before infected persons show symptoms, typically first a fever. Ebola is only contagious when those infected are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To combat the disease, with which four people have been diagnosed in the United States, several states have adopted measures over and above what is called for by federal health authorities. Maine, for example, says it will isolate any healthcare worker returning from the Ebola-stricken west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation measures have brought widespread condemnation from the medical establishment and the White House. Aid organizations say the mandatory isolation periods will make it more difficult to recruit volunteers, who typically serve in west Africa for only a few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced a program to &quot;encourage&quot; healthcare workers to go to west Africa. A press release said the program &quot;would be modeled on benefits and rights provided to military reservists,&quot; and said that returning workers would be compensated for &quot;any quarantines that are needed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, an international aid organization that responds to public health crises, commented on Hickox's isolation saying it &quot;strongly disagrees with blanket forced quarantine for healthcare workers returning from Ebola affected countries.&quot; The organization added that &quot;such a measure is not based upon established medical science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kaci Hickox has carried out important, life-saving work for [Doctors Without Borders] in a number of countries in recent years, and we are proud to have her as a member of our organization. [Doctors Without Borders] respects Kaci's right as a private citizen to challenge excessive restrictions being placed upon her,&quot; the organization said in a press release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine's top public health official has said the state will if necessary seek a court order to ensure a nurse stays quarantined in her home after returning from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurse Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for the disease on Saturday, said she would sue the state of Maine if officials did not lift a home-quarantine order and allow her to move freely by Thursday morning, arguing that such a mandate violates her personal liberties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Mayhew, the commissioner of the state department of health and human services, pleaded with Hickox to abide by the state's 21-day at-home quarantine order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to legally enforce an in-home quarantine unless absolutely necessary,&quot; Mayhew said on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayhew described the quarantine as &quot;voluntary&quot;, but said her office would seek to use the courts to keep Hickox in her home if she tried to leave. Mayhew said the process to obtain a court order had begun by Wednesday evening. One of Hickox's attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox's home &quot;for her protection and the health of the community&quot;. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said at 1pm ET on Wednesday that at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox, 33, said she is concerned that the quarantine requirements, which go beyond the recommended federal guidelines for how to monitor travellers arriving from the west Africa, were predicated on fear, not science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me. I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong, and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the restrictions placed on me by the state of Maine are not lifted by Thursday morning, I will go to court to fight for my freedom,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the governors of New York and New Jersey declared a mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea who had had contact with an Ebola sufferer. Just as the policy was introduced Hickox landed at Newark airport in New Jersey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was rushed to hospital after airport authorities detected that Hickox had a slightly elevated temperature. At the hospital, an oral thermometer recorded a more accurate temperature of 98.6F. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent with no access to a shower or television. From confinement, she published a scathing letter in the Dallas Morning News about her treatment. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, released her on Monday, and she returned to her home in Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials are asking Hickox to stay at home for the duration of her three-week isolation period, which ends on 10 November. Those infected with the Ebola virus may not develop symptoms until up to 21 days after exposure. However, people infected with Ebola are not infectious until they become symptomatic, typically after developing a fever and, even then, those infected can only spread the virus through body fluids, such as blood or vomit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York and New Jersey's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment and the White House that the orders are unnecessary, burdensome and could deter healthcare workers from volunteering in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeopaths have offered their services to prevent and treat Ebola in west Africa, claiming their &quot;remedies&quot; can work in serious epidemics of infectious disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeopaths worldwide have been mobilising their efforts toward gaining entrance in those countries affected,&quot; the National Center for Homeopathy in the US said on its website. &quot;The overriding goal is to investigate Ebola firsthand, and thereby determine which remedy or remedies are best for treating this disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation claims that homeopathic remedies have been used successfully in other disease epidemics in the past, naming cholera, diphtheria and hepatitis among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists say there is no evidence that homeopathic remedies have any effect on the body, with the substances so heavily diluted that they are effectively water. But homeopathic clinics have been set up all over Africa, sometimes offering &quot;cures&quot; for such lethal diseases as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not a jot of evidence that homeopathic treatments are effective for any infection such as Ebola,&quot; said Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor at the University of Exeter. &quot;To happily offer affected patients false hope is cruel; to pretend that homeopathy cures Ebola is irresponsible; to travel to West Africa on a 'homeopathic mission' is to disclose the insane delusions that affect many homeopaths.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, a group of young African and British doctors petitioned the World Health Organisation to speak out against homeopathy, which they believed was endangering lives. Under the auspices of the Voice of Young Science, part of the London-based Sense About Science organisation, they asked WHO to condemn the promotion of homeopathy for treating TB, infant diarrhoea, influenza, malaria and HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeopathy does not protect people from, or treat, these diseases,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Those of us working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed. When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment, lives are lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, WHO experts, backed by the director general, stated that they did not recommend homeopathy for any of those conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently no proven treatments for Ebola, which is killing 70% of those who are infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Medics working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed,&quot; said Victoria Murphy, programme manager of Sense About Science. &quot;The promotion of homeopathy as effective or cheaper makes this difficult task even harder. It puts lives at risk, undermines conventional medicine and spreads misinformation. When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment, lives are lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the homeopathy clinics brought to the WHO's attention in 2009 was the Amma Resonance Healing Foundation in Ethiopia, which offered homeopathy as &quot;an ideal alternative and complement for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries&quot;. The foundation, established in the Netherlands, is run by the British homeopath Peter Chappell. He and his colleague Harry van der Zee claim their homeopathic remedy can reverse Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On their website, Van der Zee now urges supporters of homeopathy to sign the Change.org petition started in Australia, calling on WHO &quot;to test and distribute homeopathy as quickly as possible to contain the outbreaks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the signatories is Steffan Browning, a Green Party MP in New Zealand. He was publicly dismissed by the prime minister John Key as &quot;barking mad&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's be honest, this is a serious global issue, and if he really thinks that's the answer I'd love to see the medical research,&quot; said Key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning admitted &quot;it was probably a bit unwise&quot; to sign the petition, which he also shared on his Facebook page encouraging other people to sign it. He said he had signed it &quot;pretty late at night&quot;, although he hoped WHO would keep an open mind on potential treatment options, since there was currently no cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand's health minister, Jonathan Coleman, however, said treating Ebola patients with homeopathic remedies was &quot;a wacko idea&quot;, adding: &quot;I don't know what he's thinking, it's very, very dangerous. I think he really needs to engage his brain, it's a really and stupid dangerous idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight between a Maine nurse under Ebola-quarantine orders and authorities intensified on Thursday, as the nurse defied state orders and went for a bike ride with her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse, Kaci Hickox, has argued that forced 21-day isolation orders are medically unnecessary and violate her civil rights. She has hired two New York City-based attorneys to fight Maine's orders that she stay isolated indoors until 10 November. The governor of Maine said he would back down if she agreed to take a blood test, but the standoff continued on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and tried to resolve this amicably but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,&quot; said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed state troopers have been guarding Hickox's house since Wednesday, standing outside with a huddle of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine state police followed Hickox on her bike ride with boyfriend Ted Wilbur to monitor her interaction with the public. The Associated Press reports that Maine state police cannot arrest Hickox, because they have not obtained a court order to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In an interview with ABC News, Paul LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, said he would back down if Hickox took a blood test. &quot;This could be resolved today. She has been exposed [to Ebola] and she's not cooperative, so force her to take a test. It's so simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse hired attorneys after she was questioned and detained at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey on Friday. Airport officials questioned Hickox for three hours before detecting an elevated temperature with a heat-scanning gun ( which researchers do not consider reliable ), and bringing her to a nearby hospital where she was detained. Hickox was forced to stay in an isolation tent at Newark University hospital until Monday, when the governor of New Jersey agreed to her release. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus can have an incubation period of up to 21 days before infected persons show symptoms, typically first a fever. Ebola is only contagious when those infected are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To combat the disease, with which four people have been diagnosed in the United States, several states have adopted measures over and above what is called for by federal health authorities. Maine, for example, says it will isolate any healthcare worker returning from the Ebola-stricken west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation measures have brought widespread condemnation from the medical establishment and the White House. Aid organizations say the mandatory isolation periods will make it more difficult to recruit volunteers, who typically serve in west Africa for only a few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced a program to &quot;encourage&quot; healthcare workers to go to west Africa. A press release said the program &quot;would be modeled on benefits and rights provided to military reservists,&quot; and said that returning workers would be compensated for &quot;any quarantines that are needed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, an international aid organization that responds to public health crises, commented on Hickox's isolation saying it &quot;strongly disagrees with blanket forced quarantine for healthcare workers returning from Ebola affected countries.&quot; The organization added that &quot;such a measure is not based upon established medical science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kaci Hickox has carried out important, life-saving work for [Doctors Without Borders] in a number of countries in recent years, and we are proud to have her as a member of our organization. [Doctors Without Borders] respects Kaci's right as a private citizen to challenge excessive restrictions being placed upon her,&quot; the organization said in a press release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme (WFP) is facing an unprecedented challenge in Guinea as it struggles to halt the spread of the Ebola, feed more than 350,000 people and protect the progress made in tackling chronic child malnutrition over recent years, a senior official has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elisabeth Faure, WFP's Guinea director, said the scale of the epidemic was forcing the organisation to operate far beyond its core emergency mission of getting $25m (&pound;15.5m) of food to at least 353,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as distributing the food, she said, the programme was now being called on to help build Ebola treatment centres, move aid workers around the country and provide emergency communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're transporting medical equipment into remote areas, we're helping with procuring personal protective equipment kits and gloves and we're also moving humanitarian personnel with our humanitarian air service, which is a 19-seater aircraft,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very deep engagement that goes well beyond our mandate, frankly. This is a huge operation and what's really different is building treatment centres. The WFP builds other things, like huge warehouses, and does road rehabilitation in order to get food from A to B ... But the new thing is building treatment centres.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faure said that WFP engineers, working with colleagues from the World Health Organisation and blueprints from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res were building four Ebola treatment centres, each with a 100-bed capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the scale of the logistics and emergency telecoms that is new,&quot; she said. &quot;This is quite unprecedented. It's considered a level-three emergency by the organisation - which is the highest emergency - but in fact a lot of people are saying it is about a level-five: it's much bigger than we're used to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP, she added, urgently need more money to help it cope with the emergency: despite appealing for $120m for the regional food response, it has received only about $51m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The west African Ebola outbreak has so far claimed 4,922 lives, the vast majority in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite reports that the number of cases in Liberia has begun to fall, Faure said things in Guinea were going in the opposite direction, with the &quot;robust epidemic&quot; showing no sign of subsiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen several waves, with the number of cases increasing and then declining and increasing and declining again,&quot; she said. &quot;But we're now in a kind of third peak - by far the highest peak - with the highest number of cases since the epidemic started in Guinea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faure said the wave pattern underlined the need to guard against complacency, adding that the disease was now starting to appear in previously unaffected areas of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally worrying, she said, was the effect it was having on people's ability to feed their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The spread of Ebola has affected food trade and markets and also caused wages to go down in Guinea,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent WFP survey carried out by text message showed that people were beginning to eat less or reduce the number of meals they have each day to make their money go further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's worrying, because we're no longer in the lean season, where there are food shortages,&quot; she said. &quot;Guinea was a very food insecure country to begin with and, at this time of year, things should be beginning to improve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The longer Ebola continued to spread in Guinea, said Faure, the greater the threat to existing programmes to fight the country's levels of chronic child malnutrition, which stood at 40% in some areas even before the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the health centres are closed and many of the health workers aren't working any more, so all the programmes to treat malnutrition are likely to be affected,&quot; she said. &quot;That's why we need to work not only on the emergency response, but also on the longer-term by restarting or expanding the nutrition programmes we have in the country. Otherwise, we're going to see development basically being lost and all the progress that's been made being reversed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank is to invest $100m (&pound;63m) in an attempt to increase the number of foreign health workers heading for west Africa to care for people with Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treatment centres in the three countries at the heart of the epidemic - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - are being built but the biggest need is for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers to staff them. The United Nations says around 5,000 international personnel are needed, including up to 1,000 foreign health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the UK 900 people have volunteered to go to Africa, none of whom have left yet, while the African Union has pledged 2,000 people. More numbers are needed and progress in getting volunteers to affected areas has been slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world's response to the Ebola crisis has increased significantly in recent weeks, but we still have a huge gap in getting enough trained health workers to the areas with the highest infection rates,&quot; said the World Bank Group president, Jim Yong Kim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must urgently find ways to break any barriers to the deployment of more health workers. It is our hope that this $100m can help be a catalyst for a rapid surge of health workers to the communities in dire need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pay and benefits, recruitment and training have all been issues, says the Bank. Potential volunteers are also worried about their safety - health workers are at the highest risk of contracting the disease because of their physical contact with sick patients. There have been major scares in the United States and in Spain where health workers have been infected even though they should have been well-equipped and trained in the strict safety procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers from Europe and north America also want to be sure they will be repatriated in the event of becoming ill, believing their chances of survival to be greater at home, where health systems are more sophisticated because they are better funded. The UK is building a treatment centre specifically for health workers who become infected in Sierra Leone, where standards are intended to be as high as they would be in the NHS. Other concerns include transportation and housing, says the Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new funds, which take the World Bank's total Ebola contribution so far to $500m, will help set up a coordination hub with the three countries' governments, the World Health Organisation, the UN's main Ebola coordination centre in Ghana and other agencies. The hub will actively recruit, train and deploy qualified health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health workers take an oath to treat the sick - and so it's no surprise to me that many health workers want to go to treat Ebola patients at the source of this epidemic,&quot; said Kim, an infectious disease doctor who spent years treating patients in poor countries. &quot;So we need to find all ways possible to remove any obstacle that stops health workers from serving - whether it is pay for workers in developing countries, or the promise of evacuation services. Health workers who treat Ebola patients are heroes, and we should treat them as such.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">981 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the war refugees who have escaped ransacked South Sudanese towns and impoverished villages, and for the aid workers assisting them in the western Ethiopian region of Gambella, now is a time for waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ban, 26, has been stuck in a camp on the Ethiopian border during the rainy season, sleeping in a large communal tent with her four children. They've got no mosquito nets or sheets, and she's not happy with the grain distributed by the UN as it causes diarrhoea. But because the Tierkedi and Kule camps are full, and Leitchuor camp flooded, she will have to remain in Pagak for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am waiting to be relocated,&quot; she says, pausing from bundling firewood to sell. &quot;We will be here until we [are] taken to the place we need.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncertainty in the refugee operation is twofold. Though a difficult situation is under control for now, many believe heavy fighting will resume in South Sudan once roads dry up, leading to a new surge of tens of thousands of refugees. Moreover, Ethiopia's government is struggling to find suitable locations for flooded refugees and potential new arrivals that do not disturb volatile local political dynamics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban, an ethnic Nuer from Mathiang in Upper Nile state, has been offered space at a camp along with 3,000 other people at Pagak. Only 12 accepted. That is because the camp is more than 250 miles away, in the south of Gambella - far from the Nuer strongholds in the region and close to their ethnic rivals, the Dinka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be in Kule, but we don't want another area. We don't like Dima, as it's near to the Dinka side. Dinka came to Mathiang and killed a lot of people; children, women and old people,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban is one of almost 200,000 primarily Nuer refugees who have ended up in Ethiopia since December 2013, when attempts by Kiir to arrest political rivals for coup plotting - including his Nuer former deputy, Riek Machar - prompted commanders to rebel. The ensuing clashes have claimed thousands of lives and displaced nearly 2 million people (pdf).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ceasefire deals have been signed in Addis Ababa, but in reality it is the rainy season that has discouraged the movement of potential refugees and armed groups. The result has been a huge reduction in people crossing the border, despite severe food shortages inside South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid organisations nonetheless remain alert: fading rains could lead to renewed fighting, causing a surge comparable to the first few months of the crisis, when thousands a day were arriving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why humanitarian agencies are working with a 100,000-extra influx in the latest months of the year,&quot; explains Dennis Solberg Kjeldsen, regional operations coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. &quot;So right now there's a little bit of a lull ... but we're quite sure we're going to need the resources, we're going to need funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funds are in heavy demand because of the exceptional number of emergencies occurring globally, not least the Ebola outbreak. &quot;I don't want to underestimate or downplay the threat of Ebola, but Ebola has taken an enormous amount of attention away from ongoing emergencies on the continent,&quot; he said. The UN refugee agency has received 37% of the requested $567m (&pound;355m) needed to deal with the 2 million displaced inside and outside South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are also waiting for Ethiopia's federal and regional governments to settle on an alternative to the existing Okugu camp near Dima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the refugees' fears regarding the Dinka, there are tensions in Gambella (pdf) between the Nuer and the Anuak people, another Nilotic ethnicity, which complicate the decision. Although Gambella is one of Ethiopia's most sparsely populated areas, access to its plentiful land and water is contested. Because of its fertility, the federal government has earmarked the state for commercial agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anuak, who consider themselves the original inhabitants of the area, feel encroached upon by the now more populous Nuer, and also threatened by foreign and highland farming investors. This year's influx of Nuer - equal to 60% of Gambella's 2007 official population of 307,000 - is only the latest instalment in a century-old trend. The rate of arrival has increased in the five decades since the southern Sudanese began their struggle against Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anuak discontent manifests itself in sporadic violent clashes, most recently with highlanders. In 2012, Anuak rebels killed workers at a prominent rice farm, leading to reprisals by security forces. A scuffle between schoolchildren this month led to a series of tit-for-tat killings and mob violence between Anuak and highland communities in Abobo and Gambella towns, according to Anuak elders and local security sources. The scars of a 2003 bout of violence - when, according to Human Rights Watch, soldiers and militias targeted Anuak civilians after acts of banditry - have barely healed. Anuak people fear a repeat of what some call a massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also resentment at the arrivals from the west. One of the Anuak elders, Ochodo Obang, sees all Nuer settlers as foreign colonisers. &quot;These people are like the highlanders; they want to take our land. We are the owners of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want them to be here at all. It's not a question of do we put them here or there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for officials is how to accommodate tens (and possibly hundreds) of thousands more Nuer in the next few months without stoking disputes. The dry and stable Kule and Tierkedi camps that house about 100,000 people are in former Anuak areas, Ochodo says. The ill-fated government decision to choose Leitchuor camp - located in a floodplain, it is now largely submerged - resulted from a lack of good options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of difficult issues around it, not least the ethnic dimensions,&quot; said Kjeldsen of the government's choice. &quot;We have to be careful we don't exacerbate any tension.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has refused an order by the Senate to reveal the reasons behind its ban on accepting refugees from Ebola-stricken Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, saying to disclose its advice would risk national security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia's humanitarian visa program for refugees from Ebola-affected west African countries would be suspended - including processing applications - until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later the Senate ordered the government to table the advice it had relied on in making that decision, but on Thursday the assistant minister for immigration and border protection, Michaelia Cash, told the Senate the advice could not be revealed because it would &quot;cause damage to national security&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The significant threat of Ebola continues in west Africa and whilst the level of preparedness in our country is very high, we are continually assessing our response and limiting risk wherever possible ... the government does not believe it is in the public interest to release the documents,&quot; Cash said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for the refugee ban to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lack of compassion and cruelty on display in this move has shocked the international community. Australia is being held up to ridicule because of the minister's heartless approach to people in need,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Queensland premier, Campbell Newman, has written to Morrison asking him to order blanket screening by customs and quarantine officers for Ebola symptoms for all arrivals from affected west African countries. The Queensland health department would supply the thermometers and, in return, Newman would want passenger details to be shared with the state's quarantine office and public health officials, who would then consider further tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen people from four west-African families are in home isolation in Queensland. They arrived in the state on humanitarian visas earlier this month, and one, an 18-year-old woman, was temporarily hospitalised with a fever but tested negative to Ebola on Monday. The group has another four days in quarantine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Mayhew, the commissioner of the state department of health and human services, pleaded with Hickox to abide by the state's 21-day at-home quarantine order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to legally enforce an in-home quarantine unless absolutely necessary,&quot; Mayhew said on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayhew described the quarantine as &quot;voluntary&quot;, but said her office would seek to use the courts to keep Hickox in her home if she tried to leave. Mayhew said the process to obtain a court order had begun by Wednesday evening. One of Hickox's attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox's home &quot;for her protection and the health of the community&quot;. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said at 1pm ET on Wednesday that at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox, 33, said she is concerned that the quarantine requirements, which go beyond the recommended federal guidelines for how to monitor travellers arriving from the west Africa, were predicated on fear, not science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me. I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong, and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the restrictions placed on me by the state of Maine are not lifted by Thursday morning, I will go to court to fight for my freedom,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the governors of New York and New Jersey declared a mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea who had had contact with an Ebola sufferer. Just as the policy was introduced Hickox landed at Newark airport in New Jersey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was rushed to hospital after airport authorities detected that Hickox had a slightly elevated temperature. At the hospital, an oral thermometer recorded a more accurate temperature of 98.6F. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent with no access to a shower or television. From confinement, she published a scathing letter in the Dallas Morning News about her treatment. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, released her on Monday, and she returned to her home in Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials are asking Hickox to stay at home for the duration of her three-week isolation period, which ends on 10 November. Those infected with the Ebola virus may not develop symptoms until up to 21 days after exposure. However, people infected with Ebola are not infectious until they become symptomatic, typically after developing a fever and, even then, those infected can only spread the virus through body fluids, such as blood or vomit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York and New Jersey's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment and the White House that the orders are unnecessary, burdensome and could deter healthcare workers from volunteering in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE second of two US nurses infected with Ebola has been released from hospital in what President Barack Obama hailed as a sign that the virus can be contained and &quot;will be defeated&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AmberVinson caught the disease while treating a Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, in a Texas hospital and her infection caused fears of an imminent Ebola outbreak in the US. She and another nurse, Nina Pham, were successfully treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm so grateful to be well,&quot; Ms Vinson, 29, said at Emory University Hospital in Georgia. &quot;God's love has truly carried me and my family through this difficult time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama spoke to Ms Vinson shortly before she was discharged and told reporters that she was &quot;doing well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president used the successful treatment as an opportunity to reassure an American public rattled by the US government's shaky initial response to the virus. &quot;Of the seven Americans treated for Ebola so far, all have survived,&quot; Mr Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Craig Spencer, a New York doctor who contracted the disease while treating Ebola patients in Guinea, West Africa, is now the only American known to have the disease. He is in a serious but stable condition at a Manhattan hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This disease can be contained,&quot; Mr Obama said. &quot;It will be defeated. Progress is possible, but we're going to have to stay vigilant and we've got to make sure that we're working together.&quot; The president also took a veiled shot at the governors of New York, New Jersey and Illinois, who have imposed 21-day quarantines on health workers returning from West Africa, despite the White House's insistence that such practice is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The states insist that such measures are needed to prevent any spread of the virus, but the White House and public health experts have warned it will discourage volunteers from going abroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse freed from an Ebola isolation tent in a New Jersey hospital declared on Wednesday the she will not comply with a quarantine request imposed by state officials, saying the policy is not based on science and infringes on her civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; nurse Kaci Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me, even though I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox's home &quot;for both her protection and the health of the community&quot;. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said as of 1pm ET on Wednesday at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox said she would sue the state of Maine if officials did not lift home-quarantine orders by Thursday morning. One of her attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have absolutely no justification to quarantine Kaci, and if necessary we will fight to obtain her freedom,&quot; said Siegel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Hickox was questioned for hours in Newark airport on Friday, after returning from a stint with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone. She was taken to Newark University hospital on Friday and placed in an isolation tent after airport authorities detected that Hickox had an elevated temperature using a thermal scan gun. She was released on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Several states, including Maine, maintain they will enforce strict quarantine standards for returning healthcare workers despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine's quarantine rules are voluntary, although the state's health commissioner, Mary Mayhew, said on Tuesday it would &quot;take additional measures and pursue appropriate authority&quot; if healthcare workers declined to comply with it. The state could seek a court order to compel healthcare workers exposed to Ebola in west Africa to stay in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, believes such orders could deter volunteer sign-up for trips to help with the Ebola crisis in west Africa. The aid organisation argues that because tours typically range from four to six weeks, and an additional three-week quarantine is a significant burden on healthcare volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publications such as the New England Journal of Medicine have also jumped into the fray, saying that such orders are &quot;like driving a carpet tack with a sledgehammer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approach &quot;is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal&quot;, the editorial said of the 21-day isolation requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People infected with the Ebola virus may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, spurring the calls by politicians for a three-week isolation period. However, people with the disease are not infectious until they are symptomatic, typically after developing a fever. Even then, those infected can only spread Ebola through body fluids, such as blood or vomit. The disease is not airborne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before Hickox was detained in Newark airport, a New York City doctor, Craig Spencer, was diagnosed with Ebola. The doctor took at least three trips on the subway, dined out and went bowling, spurring public anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you understand what that did to the psyche of public officials in a metropolis of nine million people,&quot; the Today show host Matt Lauer asked Hickox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course I do understand, it has created a lot of fear, but we still have to make policies based on evidence,&quot; Hickox said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US military personnel returning from anti-Ebola efforts in west Africa will be subject to a stricter quarantine than recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Pentagon announced on Wednesday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, has approved a plan from US military commanders for a &quot;controlled monitoring regimen&quot; lasting 21 days for troops deployed to Liberia and Senegal to help contain the outbreak. Over 3,900 service members are expected to join that effort, currently totalling 700, in the coming weeks. None of them come in direct contact with Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen US soldiers led by Major General Darryl Williams, who represented the initial complement of US troops sent to west Africa, are currently quarantined at a base in Vicenza, Italy. Hagel's decision expands the prospective quarantine to troops across all military branches who take part in the anti-Ebola mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new military quarantine rules place US service members under tighter monitoring conditions than the CDC consider prudent. This week, the CDC issued guidelines instructing only &quot;high-risk&quot; individuals, such as those who are exposed to Ebola-infected body fluids, to quarantine at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US personnel serving in what the military calls Operation United Assistance would not be classified as &quot;high-risk&quot; under the CDC's new Ebola guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel instructed the heads of the military services to prepare specific implementation plans for a quarantine within 15 days. The Pentagon said Hagel would review the quarantine after 45 days and decide then if continuing the quarantines are appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, characterized what he called Hagel's &quot;initial steps&quot; as &quot;prudent given the large number of military personnel transiting from their home base and west Africa and the unique logistical demands and impact this deployment has on the force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep Buck McKeon, the California Republican who chairs the House armed services committee, cautiously praised the quarantine as &quot;the right call&quot; for the time being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope DoD can find a way to balance the concerns about health and safety while minimizing the burden on overtaxed troops on what could be a long deployment, but their safety and well being must be paramount,&quot; McKeon said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a shame that the international media panic about ebola is not used more to talk about the less spectacular but more deadly health crises facing west Africans. For example, digestive infections (diarrhoea) due to polluted water and poor sanitation which kill hundreds of thousands, especially children under five. No heroic quarantine or vaccination efforts would be needed, only a modest investment in hygiene, which (for the benefit of those moved by money) has been calculated as giving an economic value of $5 for each dollar spent.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Highlight from the blogosphere</SPAN><BR></P>
