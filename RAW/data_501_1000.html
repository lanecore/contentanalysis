</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE head of the World Bank has said the world has an economic duty, as well as a moral duty, to respond to Ebola before the disease spreads further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jim Yong Kim said that lessons were having to be learned again about the &quot;terrible consequences&quot; of responding too slowly to a pandemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said global leaders had left it too late to come to the aid of the three countries most affected by Ebola - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - and that the epidemic could spread further afield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His speech came after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in America. The unidentified patient, who was being kept in isolation in Dallas, Texas, is thought to have contracted the virus in Liberia before travelling to the US nearly two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news spooked investors, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 238.19 points, or 1.4pc, to 16,804.71 last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank estimates that the disease could cost the three African countries $809m (&pound;500m) by next year if it continues to spread. In Liberia, the hardest-hit country, it predicts that Ebola could reduce output by 11.7pc in 2015, costing the country $93m and reducing GDP growth from 6.8pc to -4.9pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Inflation and food prices were initially contained but are now rising in response to shortages, panic buying and speculation,&quot; the World Bank said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Exchange rate volatility has increased in all three countries, particularly since June, fuelled by uncertainty and some capital flight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institution added that the &quot;fear of contagion&quot; was affecting labour movement, disrupting transportation and has forced the closure of sea ports and airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank has come up with a $230m finance package for the African countries affected so far. But it thinks a total of $1bn in aid could be needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation first reported an Ebola outbreak in March this year and by August it had declared the epidemic an international public health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The often-fatal illness has infected around 6,500 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone so far, with more than 3,000 deaths. The disease, which is not contagious until symptoms appear, is spread via close contact with bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health officials have predicted that deaths from other infectious diseases are likely to rise as the countries' health systems feel the strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health problems such as obesity and diabetes can have an ongoing impact on a country's economy, but epidemics attract more attention from economists because of their short-term significance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UP TO 18 people in America, including five children, may have been exposed to Ebola after coming into direct contact with the first patient to be diagnosed with the disease on US soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Eric Duncan, who arrived in Dallas, Texas, from Liberia on Sept 20, was infectious for up to eight days and health officials are already examining a second potential case in someone close to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said the children who encountered Mr Duncan and who went to four different schools in Dallas were &quot;priority number one&quot; and would be closely observed for any symptoms over the next three weeks, the incubation period for the disease. Mr Duncan, who is from Monrovia, Liberia, and has also lived in Accra, Ghana, was visiting relations in Dallas including his sister, Mai Wureh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She described how he had gone to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept 26 but was given a prescription for antibiotics and told to go home. According to Miss Wureh, he told the hospital he was visiting from Liberia, but it failed to suspect he was suffering from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eventually, on Sept 28, an ambulance was called and took him back to the hospital where he was diagnosed with the disease and placed in isolation. He is in a &quot;serious&quot; condition but doctors said he was &quot;awake, talking and hungry&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the United Nations said yesterday that a staff member in Liberia had died from &quot;probable Ebola&quot;. A spokesman for Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said it was the first death of a UN staffer in the outbreak that has so far killed more than 3,300 people in west Africa. The victim was Liberian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Texas, Zach Thompson, the director of Dallas county health and human services, said the children who had been in contact with the infected man were &quot;priority number one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;The precaution is to keep the children home. We will evaluate and they will be monitored. The fact that we have one confirmed case ... there may be another case that is a close associate with this particular patient. So, I want to be frank, this is real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group being monitored includes two fire service paramedics and their intern who were sent to pick up the patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tests on the paramedics have so far proved negative but they have been isolated for three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An ambulance they used had remained in service for another 48 hours but has now been decontaminated and quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said: &quot;It's possible that someone who had contact with this individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged people not to panic, saying the disease would be &quot;stopped in its tracks&quot;. But after the diagnosis was announced, social media networks exploded, with up to 50,000 mentions of Ebola in an hour on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dallas has a Liberian community of about 10,000. Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, said: &quot;We've been telling people to try to stay away from social gatherings. We need to know who it is so that they can all go get tested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Liberian official confirmed that Mr stopped in Brussels on his way to the US. But health officials said there was &quot;zero&quot; chance of him being infectious during the flight because he did not have symptoms at that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigation has been opened at the hospital to see why he was not admitted on his first visit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside Africa told medical staff he had recently travelled from Liberia, but was not admitted to hospital until he returned two days later, health officials in Texas said yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Eric Duncan told a nurse he had just travelled from the west African country, which has been ravaged by the Ebola outbreak, but the information was not widely enough shared with the medical team, said a spokesman for Texas Health Presbyterian hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan's sister, Mai Wureh, told the Associated Press he first visited the hospital's emergency room on Friday, but was sent home with antibiotics - an outcome Texas health chiefs describe as a matter of regret. He was admitted only after his condition worsened and he returned to the hospital on Sunday. Yesterday his condition was described as serious but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the apartment complex where Duncan was staying, Mesud Osmanovic, 21, a fellow resident, said he saw the ambulance arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it came, his whole family were all screaming, he got outside and he was throwing up all over the place . . . when he was throwing up he was trying to walk and he couldn't walk,&quot; Osmanovic said. He said Duncan was helpful to neighbours, adding: &quot;I know him through his family . . . this ain't his first time coming to America. He was a quiet guy, a really nice guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas governor Rick Perry said school-age children who may have been in contact with the patient were being monitored at home for signs of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Lester, a senior executive at Texas Health Resources, which operates the hospital, said medical staff used an Ebola checklist on his first visit, which included a question about travel history. &quot;Regretfully, that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team. As a result the full import of that question was not factored in to the clinical decision-making,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That failure led staff to conclude that Duncan's symptoms were &quot;not yet typical&quot; for Ebola and that he was suffering from a &quot;low-grade, common viral disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan was vomiting when the ambulance got to the hospital, said Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. Three of the ambulance crew have tested negative for the virus but were restricted to their homes while their conditions were observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the federal public health agency, has sent a team of nine to Texas to assist officials. &quot;If anyone develops fever, we'll immediately isolate them to stop the chain of transmission,&quot; said Tom Frieden, director of the CDC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas department of state health services, said: &quot;This is not west Africa. This is a very sophisticated city, a very sophisticated hospital, and the dynamics are so significantly different than they are in west Africa that the chances of it being spread are very, very, very small.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a spokeswoman for United Airlines said the carrier believes it flew Duncan from Brussels to Dallas Fort Worth via Washington on 20 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC said there was &quot;zero risk of transmission&quot; on these two flights because the patient showed no symptoms at the time and therefore could not have been contagious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We only open one of our centres for 30 minutes, just to admit people who can fill the beds of the people who died overnight. This is how bad it is. The rest of the day we are turning patients back home to go and infect their neighbours and loved ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight hundred beds have been promised by the international community - less than a third of the 3,000 the World Health Organisation says is urgently needed.

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">862 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of a medical team of volunteers from Uganda has stressed the need for more blood donation to various ETUs as one of the surest ways of fighting the Ebola Virus Disease. Dr. Anne Deborah Atai-Omoruto wants Philanthropists and kind-hearted individuals to donate blood to help save the lives of thousands of Liberians who are facing the life threatening EVD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan trained doctor and WHO consultant on Ebola says that patients need more blood during treatment because the Ebola virus damages the clotting system of the body that usually helps to protect and prevent abnormal loss of plasma when there is bleeding. She told Developmental Media Incorporated (DMI) that those clotting factors are available in every human, because the body repairs itself all the time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing the importance of blood in this Ebola struggle, Dr. Atai-Omoruto said: &quot;We need the antibodies of people, especially from the survivors, because when the body system is stunned by the Ebola virus and you are able to quickly infuse a survivor's blood into a patient, it helps fight the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It suffocates more about the virus and gives the person better chance of survival.&quot; She wants a blood bank to be established, where blood donated by Liberians will be managed by WHO, CDC and the government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. Atai has regretted the lack of space to accommodate sick people turning out at treatment centers across the country, saying &quot;As a medical doctor, it is very frustrating to see that you cannot help a patient who is desperately in need of your help even though you would love to render them assistance, my desire is that everyone who comes here should get treatment; even if I have to put them under a tree, I will definitely do that, that is actually what I want to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the severity of the West African outbreak, Dr. Atai explicated that the strand of the Ebola virus that they know in Uganda is different from what she and her colleagues are battling in West Africa stating that the strand of the Ebola virus in Liberia and neighboring countries is very strange and deceptive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan Doctor said it is difficult to fight this new strand of EVD because of the very high population in the Capital. &quot;There is much crowding, there are lots of activities, a lot of body contact and the virus took the country completely unaware.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Atai and her team has been training local health workers from across the country in handling, treatment of patients of the filo-virus Ebola since they arrived in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am just hoping that I can build enough capacity so that I can hand over those health workers to ETUs that are being built after been through the training and knowing exactly what need to be done&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Anne Deborah Atai-Omoruto, a graduate of Makerere University in Uganda and chair of the Department of Family Medicine, is a Practicing Family Physician and a founding member of the Association of Family Physicians of East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to her role as the President of the Family Physicians of Uganda, she has also conducted insightful research as a doctor, primarily in the field of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIVs, and malaria. She's currently serving as a consultant to WHO assigned at the Island Hospital (formerly Island Clinic) Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Tweh Farm Community. She is the head of a team of twelve Ugandan health workers, which includes two Physician Assistants, eight Nurses, and two doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few days ago, Dr. Tolbert Nyanswah, Assistant Health Minister for Curative Services, spoke of the government's efforts to increase the number of treatment units across the country to 17; so that those who are sick can access those centers in their respective counties. &quot;This will ensure quick treatment and survival for people turning out soon for treatment&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola Treatment Unit at the island hospital in Tweh Farm Community which is being managed by the Ugandan team was built to help boost patient survival chances as other ETUs around Monrovia continue to receive a multiplicity of cases. But it has dramatically experienced a sharp increase in the number of patients that it's capacitated to handle from 150, with a little over 170 patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now six months since the deadly Ebola virus entered into Liberia through the Republic of Guinea, affecting Liberia which now reports the highest cases of death from the virus in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Center of Disease Control, the death toll now stands at 1,677, and the number of cases reported at 3,280 with 890 laboratory confirmed cases in Liberia. Even in the wake of increased international support to countries affected by the virus, the case level continues to upsurge exponentially-not linearly, on a daily basis with international experts from WHO and CDC estimating that a total of 1.4m cases before the virus are brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, an elderly healthcare worker emphasized to DMI, the need for government to set up mini-clinics at the various Ebola treatment centers so that those who are sick from curable diseases can be prevented from dying from the lack of attention and rejection at regular facilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Education says it is planning to re-open schools but with no mention of the definite time, announcing also that it will soon begin providing educational courses via radio. Deputy Minister for Early Child Education, Felicia Doe-Somah, who addressed the Ministry of Information's regular Ebola press briefings Tuesday clarified, however, that the reopening of school is contingent on instructions by the necessary authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told journalists that hand washing buckets will be placed at every school corner at various institutions when schools are reopened to ensure the necessary hygienic measure that will forestall the spreading of the deadly Ebola virus amongst students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, the Education Ministry has been involved with awareness of how to prevent the further spread of the virus since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus which led to the subsequent closure of schools around the country. She noted that in early August the ministry was concerned about students being put out of schools, which prompted the ministry to launch awareness campaigns in eight counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy minister said the idea of the awareness is to engage the citizens of the county, district, and community levels on the method of teaching by radio, stressing that the MoE wants to jump start a process that will benefit the entire citizenry. Noting that the MoE has a big stake in the fight against Ebola, Madam Somah also disclosed a teaching by radio program which she said is underway at the ministry and will continue even after the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing the need for early childhood education, Madam Somah said providing early childhood education via radio is not limited to the Ebola period, but is instead an inter-sectoral project that will continue even in a post Ebola era and will include &quot;Meet the counselor strategy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meet the counselor strategy will provide psychosocial counseling for victims who lost their family members as the result of the Ebola tragedy. Madam some expressed confidence that the public will benefit more from listening to the radio when the program is launched, adding that lots of people are already showing interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief justice Francis S. Korkpor, Sr. has Warned Magistrates against acts that do not conform with the law during this Ebola crisis. Chief justice, Francis Korkpor, has encouraged Magistrates to make maximum use of the safeguards under the law during this Ebola crisis period, taking into consideration options for arrest and detention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, though the judiciary will not go about disseminating information to the public regarding precautionary measures against the Ebola virus in the county, the third branch of government should contribute immensely to the fight against the Ebola virus in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while he is not ordering them to perform their duties out of the scope of the law, he is encouraging them to play a meaningful role in exercising discretionary powers under Sections 10.12 and 13.5 of the criminal procedure law. He pointed out that the judiciary is to ensure that it plays one of the pivotal roles in containing the deadly Ebola viral disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Supreme Court's regular administrative meeting with Magistrates of the Temple of Justice Tuesday, Justice Korkpor however, indicated that the application of discretionary powers must be done on a case by case basis given the facts and circumstances of the prevailing situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged them to be punctual on duty, stressing that any magistrate that does not take time into consideration and absenting himself from the job will be considered non-essential staff, and that stringent administrative measures will be instituted against those magistrates involved in such practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touching on jury sequestration, Chief Justice Francis Korkpor said the judiciary has held deliberations with the Liberian National Bar Association, where the issue of the reduction of the number of jurors and the sequestration of the jury were addressed due to the out-break of the Ebola virus in the country. He indicated that instead of 15- man jury with three alternates, they resolved that the number be reduced to nine with three alternates out of the nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Korkpor extolled the cordial working relationship between the Judiciary and the Executive, making specific reference to the Ministry of Justice and the Liberian National Bar Association regarding efforts aimed at playing a meaningful role in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the justice Ministry, Montserrado County Attorney, Cllr, Daku J. Mulbah, and Assistant justice Minister for Litigation and Acting Solicitor General, Cllr. Augustine Fayiah assured the judiciary that the ministry will continue to exhibit the spirit of collaboration so as to be able to play pivotal roles in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, the magistrates told the Chief Justice that they will exercise maximum judicial powers as enshrined in statutes having into consideration the use discretionary powers that will reduce over-crowdedness of prisons, especially when it comes to arrest, summon and detention of defendants during the fight against the Ebola.</SPAN></P>

Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia for the death of his 20-year-old daughter Nakita Dieh Forh last Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker said the JFK workers refused his daughter treatment and requested for Ebola clearance before catering to her. &quot;I will sue this government and the JFK,&quot; Forh exclaimed, and said the government should be responsible for the untimely death of his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, he explained, should take responsibility for the death of Nakita for what he termed &quot;wrong mandate&quot; given to health care workers which demands submission of Ebola clearance before accepting to treat patients. According to Representative Forh, his anger arises from the rejection of his daughter by medical center, leaving her to die before performing a test that proved her Ebola negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Montserrado County representative said the late Nakita was a crown holder as &quot;Miss Stella Maris Polytechnic&quot; and was preparing for graduation this semester, asserting that the government needs to reconsider its decision which demands Ebola clearance before treatment is given to a patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Forh also recommends the establishment of testing centers at every major health care center in the country. He now understands and believes that several persons have died from common illness due to what he describes as an inappropriate rejection of patients by the health workers using the fear of Ebola. His understanding of the troubling mandate given health care centers derived from the handling of his daughter, Nakita, which caused her death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Federation of borough youth (FOBY), the umbrella organization of youth in the Municipal borough of New Kru town extends deepest condolence to the representative and the entire Forh family for the loss of the late Nakita Die For.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commander of the U. S. Mission, Major-General Williams indicated that the United States military had conducted an assessment that have documented useful information about the challenges and conditions the United States soldiers are expected to grapple during their operations in the country before the mission's gradual build up and subsequent arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalist during a news conference that the mission's operational scope is by far bigger than the Monrovia area, saying that the troops were fully prepared to enter every part of the country to achieve the mandate of the mission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deployment has begun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the 3,000-membered States military mission has begun deploying troops to strategic military positions for its operations in Liberia, according to military sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a press conference at the US Embassy in Monrovia Monday, Maj. Gen. Williams, the commander of the US Army Africa Command (AFRICOM), clarified that the mission of the United States Army in Liberia is different from the US battle Frontline troop in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Williams said a skeletal team of about 175 troops have already landed in Liberia undertaking operations along with the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) for the constructions of Ebola care centers as well as the US logistical plans to support medical operations in the fight against the Ebola virus in every part of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of the next few weeks or days, he said, Liberians will soon start to witness the movement of US Military choppers and vehicles in Monrovia and other parts of Liberia, calling on the people of Liberia not to worry about the movement and the visibility of the US military in full readiness to support efforts by the United States Government and international partners towards the fight against Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US marines, Maj. Gen. Williams indicated, has begun working with the AFL in executing the Liberian government's health plans presented to him by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf towards the anti-Ebola fight to curb the outbreak in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US general, who described the Liberian government's plan as well, said the AFL and the US troops will operate within the plan to support the anti-Ebola efforts, stressing that the US military mission in Liberia was for logistical supports in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the US troops have begun the erecting of 25-bed hospital as part of 17 Ebola care centers earmarked for construction in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Plan to force regime out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the news conference, U.S. Ambassador Deborah R. Malac clarified that the US military mission's mandate does not contain forceful removal of the Government of Liberia from power; instead it is here to support the plans relating to the fight against the deadly Ebola virus out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac, taking not of speculation that troops were coming to replace the Liberian government, emphasized that any plan of forceful removal of the Liberian government from power is not a part of the U. S. Government's plan for Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The field team leader of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Brendan Flannery, also spoke at the conference and said Ebola patients should be treated with compassion due to the nature of their situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Flannery said the situation in Liberia is serious and does not call for stigmatizing Ebola patients who need to be treated with compassion and Ebola survivors must also be accepted in their communities to give them hope when they survive the deadly pestilence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the CDC head to Liberia did not attach timeline to the end of the virus outbreak, but indicated the importance in establishing Ebola care centers in communities to serve as the first place for sick persons go and get separated from the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Flannery further said when such system is established, there will be an easy approach in fighting the virus from the community level while the ETUs will only serve as treatment centers for only Ebola patients identified by these care centers in communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concluding, Dr. Flannery said the presence of a CDC team in Liberia will also help in the training of Liberian health workers in the fight against Ebola while the 25-bed room unit will provide care to health workers contacting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, U.S. military C-17s has landed at Roberts International Airport over the weekend carrying key pieces of U.S. military equipment to aid in the anti-Ebola fight: two mobile Ebola testing labs and equipment to build the 25-bed field hospital for health care workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mobile labs will be placed at the Ebola Treatment Centers (ETUs) at Island Clinic and in Bong County, and are expected to be operational this week. The labs are a huge step in stopping the spread of Ebola, because they reduce the time needed to determine if a patient has Ebola from several days to just a few hours. The labs will be operated by members of a U.S. Navy Medical Research Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25-bed hospital arrived as U.S. Seabees broke ground on the hospital site in Margibi County. Originally designed to treat military service members in combat zones, the facility will be staffed by the U.S. Public Health Service and will be used to care for health workers in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25-bed hospital and mobile testing labs are part of the U.S. effort to help the government of Liberia and other Ebola-affected countries contain the Ebola virus, save lives and alleviate human suffering. Other U.S. activities include setting up a logistics base to facilitate the flow of military personnel, supplies, and equipment into the affected region, helping to build 17 Ebola treatment units, and training for hundreds of health care workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. government agency overseeing the overall U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The U.S. military response, led by Major General Darryl Williams, Commanding General of U.S. Army Africa, is acting in support of the USAID-led Disaster Assistance Response Team by providing expertise in command and control, engineering and logistics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2151 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 12 months ago the United Nations and other members of the international community hailed Liberia as a &quot;success story&quot; of international partnership for peace and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A robust UN peace-building force has taken charge of the security while a new civil administration that grew out of these efforts fostered peace, reconciliation, reconstruction, and economic growth. But 12 months later, the nation is staring down a nefarious abyss created by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many lives have been lost and counting. The economy has not only grounded to a halt, but it is also on a downward spiral. Liberia's Foreign Minister Augustine KpeheNgafuan was at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to tell Liberia's &quot;sad story&quot; to the world. The Analyst, reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Augustine Ngafuan has congratulated leaders of UN and other members of the international community for rushing to Liberia's side against the deadly Ebola virus. He, however warned that it would be a deadly mistake to allow the flurry of international efforts and commitment to lead to complacency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign minister's comments were contained in a statement he delivered on behalf of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf on September 29, 2014, at the 69th Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Minister Ngafuan briefly reminisced on the upward thrust of the Liberian economy by the end of 2013 before he launched into the &quot;sad story&quot; of a nation deep in the throes of death and almost-complete economic reversal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian foreign minister recalled that by the end of fiscal 2013, Liberia was on course with the theme of the 69th UN Regular Session, &quot;Delivering on and Implementing a Transformative Post-2015 Development Agenda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its own development agenda dubbed, &quot;Agenda for Transformation (AfT)&quot;, he said, postwar Liberia had transitioned from emphasis on stabilization to focus on transformation within the framework of a long-term development agenda christened &quot;Vision 2030&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said all of this came to an abrupt halt in a few months with the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in March 2014. Within a month, the economy began spinning out of control as Ebola mowed down helpless Liberians and overwhelmed the already struggling health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, he said, this sudden downward spiral has not only undermined the UN High-Level Panel's &quot;leave no one behind&quot; call, but that it has also threatened the very foundation of the Liberian economy and reversed all gains. In a sense according to him, a few months of the Ebola plague has wolfed up a decade of progress and curtained hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quoted President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's August 2013 address to the UN General Assembly as detailing the strides Liberia had recorded. Despite the challenges that faced the nation, he recalled, President Sirleaf had told the UN assembly that her administration had helped foster a regional integration within the Mano River enclave. She also reported Liberia's role in regional peacekeeping efforts and disclosed that the enclave was about to facilitate power connectivity and transport systems to promote regional trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[But] one year later, as I stand to address this august body, I have become the purveyor of a different kind of story - a sad story,&quot; he told the world assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past six months, a dark cloud has been hanging over the Liberian landscape such that instead of reporting on economic growth, we are constrained to report economic decline. Implementation of virtually all pillars of our Agenda for Transformation (AfT) has been placed on hold, and gains are perhaps already being reversed,&quot; the Liberian foreign minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he said, the nation is buckling down to seeking regional and international cooperation to fight what he called the &quot;deadly enemy&quot;. &quot;The deadly enemy that has visited so much harm and misery on my country, a small country of only 4 million people, and our neighbors, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), which began wreaking havoc in Liberia in March of this year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In efforts to ward off the havoc, he said, the government declared a state of emergency, suspended schools, and stepped up awareness and prevention campaigns in collaboration with the civil society and the NGO community. These efforts have so far helped to address what he called the crystallized denial and deeply rooted traditional and cultural practices that create a fertile ground for the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have also committed and will continue to commit significant portions of our own paltry resources to the fight,&quot; he said. But he was quick to note that daunting challenges remained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola has confounded all of us and has sprinted faster than our collective efforts, snuffing out the life candle of more than 1,800 of our compatriots with a total of nearly 3,500 infected In spite of these efforts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the grim statistics was in spite of the government's efforts being buttressed by partners from the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control, Medecins Sans Frontiers, the Samaritans Purse and several bilateral and multilateral partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to human toll left in the wake of the virus' devastation, Minister Ngafuan revealed, is a trail of traumatized orphans scattered in several communities in Monrovia and other affected areas. He gave no figure; but he noted that it was a problem in waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told a story of a 10-year-old who is a lone survivor of a family of 12. He then noted that with a pool of endangered, a timid health workforce that has suffered 89 deaths out of 182 infected, it was a matter of time before Liberia crumbled under the weight of what seems 21st Century's biggest health disaster in modern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Foreign Service boss said, &quot;The resulting panic that arises from health workers seeing their colleagues die from Ebola has precipitated the closure of many health facilities across the country. As we and our many international partners struggle to douse the wildfire caused by Ebola, we have been left with inadequate resources, time and personnel to attend to other routine illnesses like malaria, typhoid fever and measles, thereby causing many more tangential deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An increasing number of pregnant women are dying in the process of bringing forth life. In short, our public health system, which totally collapsed during years of conflict and was being gradually rebuilt, has relapsed under the weight of the deadly virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this meant, he said, was that the world needed to come to the realization that &quot;Ebola is not just a health crisis&quot;. &quot;It is a total crisis- it is an economic crisis, a social crisis, and a potential political and security crisis. Indeed, its deleterious impact has been very wide and very deep,&quot; he disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an economic crisis, he said, Ebola has caused a 3.4% downward slide in economic growth, from a high of 5.9% to a low of 2.5% in 2014; and some experts have predicted that, if not contained quickly, Ebola could cause a 12% decline in our economy in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, that is not all, he said. &quot;Domestic food production, mining, transport services, the construction and hospitality industries, trade and many other productive components of our economy have all registered significant reversals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Concessionaires have scaled down their operations, causing a large contingent of expatriates to leave the country. As a result of the slowdown in economic activities, our revenue generation capacity has been seriously undermined resulting in a nearly 20% downward revision of our budget for Fiscal Year 2014/2015. In spite of this depressing domestic revenue outlook, our country has been dedicating a hefty portion of its scarce resources to the fight. Consequently, our ability to provide for basic social services and continue to fund key development projects are significantly diminished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The suspension of flights as well as the travel and other restrictions/sanctions imposed on Liberia and other affected countries, contrary to expert advice from WHO and others, did not only undermine the humanitarian efforts aimed at quickly containing the disease, but also aggravated the adverse economic effects of the Ebola crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the statistics and prevailing conditions portend bigger hardship and more lost of innocent lives, the Liberian foreign minister was hopeful of a coming new day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Through separate and joint appeals of the Heads of State of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to the UN Secretary-General and leaders of friendly countries and institutions, the international community is showing a better understanding and deeper appreciation of the unprecedented scope and magnitude of the Ebola outbreak in our countries. There is a chorus of leaders advocating and committing to support more robust, scaled up and urgent assistance to the affected countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst these &quot;positive developments&quot;, the minister said, is the decision by the US government to deploy 3000 military and medical specialist personnel to build treatment centers, train health personnel and provide other types of much needed support to Liberia and other affected countries. The personnel, he said, have already begun to arrive in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another sign of bubbling international partnership that inspire hope, he noted, was the UN Security Council's September 18 Resolution 2177, which recognized the Ebola crisis as a threat to international peace and security, necessitating strong and concerted international response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's cause for hope also, he said, rests with an announcement by the Secretary-General on 18 September of his intention to establish the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I speak, the Head of UNMEER is in the region and will be discussing the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for activating the mission,&quot; he disclosed further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the start of the deployment of the African Union (AU) contingents of medical and relevant personnel drawn from across Africa to Liberia, other worst affected countries, and the convening by the Secretary-General on 25 September of a High-Level meeting on the Ebola epidemic gave further ground for hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the September 25th UN meeting witnessed the announcements of substantial commitments of assistance from many countries, including France, China, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Timor Leste and multilateral institutions including the World Bank and regional organizations such as the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides these efforts, he said, the air travel nightmare imposed by restriction to Liberia has been eased by the relaxation of travel restrictions by some AU and ECOWAS member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, he said, Air Cote D'Ivoire is poised to resume flights to Liberia within a week while Kenya Airways would resume flight sometime this month. The resumption of flights to Liberia, he said, would make it easy for the airlifting of critically needed protective equipment and supplies to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two wars ahead: No time for complacency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The expressions of solidarity have taken many forms and we are deeply grateful for all of them,&quot; the foreign minister said. But he warned that these efforts should not lead toward complacency because containing the spread of the virus opens a two-front war corridor to recovery. &quot;While we struggle with the first war of actually disrupting the transmission of Ebola, we, along with our bilateral and multilateral partners, must begin to prepare for the second war,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second war, he said, would entail tackling the long-term socioeconomic impacts of the Ebola crisis. That aspect of the war, he said, entails &quot;building and capacitating a new public health system that can robustly deal with any future health challenge, catering for the increasing numbers of orphans and other traumatized and impoverished family members, and quickly raising resources to address a legion of socioeconomic, political, security and other challenges made more acute by the presence of Ebola&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the foreign minister has expressed the Sirleaf Administration's appreciation to the UN for UNMIL's presence in Liberia, which he said, reassures Liberians and creates a secure climate at the time the country was experiencing isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, UNMIL's continued engagement in Liberia will be critical to enabling Liberia to transition smoothly from the Ebola Crisis and resume implementation of strategies for the achievement of our long-term development agenda,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said despite the challenges posed by Ebola, UNMIL's presence has inspired courage in the population to fight in efforts to defeat the grim statistics of 1.4 million deaths by January 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead, President Sirleaf and the resilient people of Liberia feel that the Ebola epidemic has presented us with a one-option, multiple-choice test; and that option is to fight back! And we are fighting back,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf Meets With US Assistant Secretary of Defense, Michael Lumpkin Meets with UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Ebola Response, Anthony Banbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-powered United States delegation currently in the country has hailed President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's international engagements since the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the head of delegation, Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Lumpkin, said the United States sees the eradication of the Ebola virus disease as paramount and urgent and will work with the Liberian authorities in achieving this goal. Mr. Lumpkin said he has felt and seen the courage of the Liberian people in fighting the virus and their eagerness to return to normalcy should be supported by the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Assistant Secretary of Defense told the Liberian leader that the delegation's presence in Monrovia was in further demonstration of the United States Government's commitment to help Liberia fight the deadly virus and will remain closely engaged as all fight together in eradicating the disease. He assured the Liberian leader that the US military has already begun working with their Liberian counterparts to carry out the construction of Ebola Treatment Units across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lumpkin said he foresees tremendous progress in the fight with the level of cooperation between Liberians and Americans and called for more collaborative efforts toward the eradication. Briefing the delegation earlier, President Sirleaf said government in collaboration with national and international partners has now formulated a common strategy which is working well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She, however informed the US delegation that Liberia would love to take ownership of the process with the support of the international community which she said will go a long way in future eventualities particularly in health care delivery. President Sirleaf said Liberia has begun to see progress with the support of the international community and is eager to see a stabilization of the situation thereby resuscitating the economy that has been hardly hit by the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed the American delegation that their presence has made a huge difference and expressed the hope that with the intervention by other friendly governments, Liberia will soon record the Ebola outbreak as history. Finance and Development Planning Minister-designate Amara Konneh and Defense Minister Brownie Samukai, respectively briefed the delegation on the economic outlook and Armed Force of Liberia (AFL) involvement in the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh thanked the US Government for the US$5 million dollar budget support as health workers' incentives, but pleaded for more budgetary support as that amount would only take the health workers' incentive payment up to January 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the delegation who met with President Sirleaf included the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assistant administrator, Nancy Linborg; DART team leader, William Berger; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Thomas Kenyon; policy advisor, Denise Marsh; USAID mission director, John Mark Winfield; and economic officer, Eric Johnson. They were accompanied by US Ambassador Deborah Malac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other presidential news, the Liberian leader met with the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Ebola Response during a courtesy visit on Wednesday, October 1, 2014. Mr. Anthony Banbury, who is resident in Accra, Ghana, was accompanied to the President Sirleaf'sForeign Ministry office by the head of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) Ms. Karen Langren. She encouraged the Liberian leader to remain internationally engaged as it has yielded fruitful results as regards her leadership's effort in the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the Mr. Bonbury promised President Sirleaf that the UN Ebola fight would be integrated into the country's national plan and strategy and agreed with the President of Liberian ownership with full partners' participation tapping on their expertise. He said the new UN agency, UN Mission on Ebola Response, as part of its terms of reference, will fill in gaps in the Ebola fight in consultation with the national strategy in order to prevent any form of duplication of an already existing strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, President Sirleaf welcomed the creation of the UN Ebola Response office in Accra and encouraged the office to promote information exchange on the virus among affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, President Sirleaf urged the agency to support government in strengthening its rural outreach initiatives. She named bad roads and under reporting on the status of Ebola in the rural settings which has prevented the government from moving into those areas to arrest any further spread. &quot;Affected people are leaving from urban places and hiding out in remote communities. If we do not move in as quickly as possible, the virus would further spread in rural areas. This has led to all the 15 counties now reporting cases with those that had no case now reporting the low number of cases,&quot; President Sirleaf informed Mr. Bonbury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">821 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf meets with delegation from Heartt Foundation and AmeriCares led by the Foundation's interim executive director, Masmina Sirleaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A visiting delegation of the Health Education and Relief through Teaching (HEARTT) Foundation and its collaborating partner, AmeriCares has held a meeting with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf at her Foreign Ministry office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the head of delegation, HEARTT Foundation's interim executive director Masmina Sirleaf, informed the Liberian leader that the visit was aimed at briefing her about HEARTT and AmeriCares' intervention in West Africa and Liberia in particular in light of the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease now ravaging the sub-region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that HEARTT's response to the West African Ebola outbreak has focused on support for Liberian health facilities and protection of the frontline health workers. &quot;Through our partners and donor networks, we have provided shipments of personal protective equipment, IV fluids and other life-saving supplies worth more than $500,000 to hospitals, clinics and treatment centers,&quot; Mrs. Sirleaf stressed, adding, &quot;Over the next several days, HEARTT will distribute three shipments from AmeriCares and one from Liberia Medical Relief with the assistance of local chapters of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and the Monrovia Rotary Club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, President Sirleaf welcomed HEARTT and AmeriCares to Liberia and recognized their local partners, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and the Monrovia Rotary Club. She reflected that she has followed HEARTT's work in Liberia long before the start of her administration and described their work as &quot;a good example of Liberians helping Liberia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader further noted the good work of HEARTT and AmeriCares that include several interventions at the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Medical Center and the Redemption Hospital in Monrovia which has helped train medical staffers and provide opportunity for the deployment of doctors and other healthcare professionals to render voluntary services to Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf also recognized that the group has been a major contributor to Liberia's healthcare services which ensured that doctors performed critical free operations at the JFK Medical Center. &quot;Even though the voluntary doctors left Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak, we are happy to know that HEARTT, AmeriCares and their local partners are still here providing and distributing essentially needed medical supplies and protective equipment to Ebola Treatment Centers and other regular health facilities,&quot; she pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told both HEARTT and AmeriCares that their partnership has not only given hope to Liberians but proven that there are still groups out there that really care for people in need and in crisis; adding that she applauds the institutions for their role in all they are doing as the country battles an unknown disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf also praised the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Alpha Phil Alpha Fraternity and Monrovia Rotary Club who are utilizing their own resources, with no request from government to help Liberia overcome the further spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HEARTT Foundation was born against the backdrop of post-conflict Liberia reweaving its social and economic fabric. HEARTT Foundation recruits and facilitates the travel of volunteer clinicians to increase clinical care capacity and provide hands-on training and lectures to local healthcare workers at the JFK Medical Center and Redemption Hospital in Monrovia.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberian Cleric, Prophet Ignatius W. White, says it takes the intervention of God to rid the country of the deadly Ebola virus, calling on Liberians and the government and partners not rule out God's intercession in the fight against Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The founder and general overseer of the Power in Prayer Ministry told The Analyst in Monrovia yesterday that the fight against Ebola can be won as speedily as possible provided Liberians and international involve the church to invoke God's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in a not too distant future, Liberians and their international partners will soon join hands in dancing and singing glory to God through Jesus for the victory over the Ebola virus in Liberia. He reminded Liberians and the international community to bow in worship to Jesus, focus on God for the efforts in the fight against the virus that was claiming lives in the country, the Mino River Union basin as well as in other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the general overseer of the Power in Prayer Ministry, there is power in prayer. The Overseer who is also the Senior Pastor of the Headquarter Church of the Power in Prayer Ministryassured that God has removed the Ebola virus from Liberia and just in the matters of time Liberians and their international partners will soon be celebrating the defeat of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prophet White further explained that God's miracle manifested and many persons saved in the Name of Jesus Christ at a fast and a prayer service that had nearly 400 persons in attendance, indicating that the service which had a direct focus for a particular Liberian family base in Liberia and USA drew the attention of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prophet White began his ministry as far back in 2006 following a year of fast and prayer after family rejection. He said through the favor of the ministry God is now growing with a membership of more than 200 persons as the power of God continues to prevail in everyday service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He clarified that the work of God and salvation through Jesus, we're free, added that he is not selling healing miracles manifested through the power of God. According to Prophet White, until God's appointed time Ebola will run out of Liberia, which time he added was already at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Power in Prayer Ministry General Overseer, Prophet White stressed that the power of God was still alive and could be realized when people continue to demonstrate faith in Jesus regarding their situation or whatever they may be experienced regardless of the kind of disease or sickness they were experiencing in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prophet White said the power of God was being manifested in his ministry with God healing all kinds of sicknesses, stressing that it was important that the people of Liberia commit their lives into the care of the God through Jesus as God was able to perform His miracles at anytime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Security Council has extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMILL) by one year to September 30, 2015. Disclosing this during a press conference at UNMIL's headquarters in Monrovia Wednesday, the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG), Karin Landgren, said this is due to the Ebola pandemic that has hit the country and claimed the lives of hundreds since March this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landgren explained that because of the Ebola crisis, the United Nations Security Council did not discuss the drawdown of UNMIL and security transition during its Council meeting on September 9, 2014. The UN official said it devoted discussions entirely to the rapid development related to Ebola outbreak, which they termed as Liberia's 'gravest threat since the end of the civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that discussion about UNMIL drawdown in Liberia was suspended in order to focus discussion entirely on the destabilizing impact of Ebola and the economic, social, political and security consequences that are already being felt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stressed that prices have risen, economic growth is expected to be cut by more than half, trade has reduced, many farmers are not tending their fields in affected areas, and children are not in school. Landgren pointed out that the Security Council adopted its resolution on UNMIL on September 15th, expressing grave concern about the extent of the outbreak of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that one of the messages reinforced by the Security Council is that UNMIL is staying at Liberia's side as the country battles to turn the tide of Ebola infections. She emphasized that UNMIL's mandate has been rolled over until the end of 2014 which, according to her, means that UNMIL was extended without any changes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US delegation headed by Assistance Administrator of USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance, Nancy Lindborg, told a news conference at the US Embassy near Monrovia Wednesday that the delegation was in the country to have a better understanding on how the situation was on the Liberian soil especially as it relates to the Ebola virus outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Lindborg said the US Government had a very clear strategy in line with the Liberian government and international partners to respond to the pandemic in Liberia and the sub-region as a whole. He concluded by praising the Liberian government and partners for the progress made so far in the fight against the Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking was the head of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Thomas Kenyon, who reiterated the willingness of the US Government through the CDC to help respond to the Ebola outbreak min Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 30, 2014</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fellow citizens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies &amp; Gentlemen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today had promised to be a very exciting date on the calendar of the Press Union of Liberia - 50 years on the struggle to ensure a free and responsible media landscape - 50 years of standing up to power, demanding and insisting upon the right to freely express ourselves, in so far as this expression was not tearing down bridges and creating division. Unfortunately, the difficult and cruel army of the Ebola virus disease has restricted our desire to celebrate this day, given the wily disruption it has posed in our country and the subregion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further on the account of the Ebola situation, all aspects of Liberian life have gradually ground to a halt. Schools are no longer open - children are lazying home; non-essential staff - whether from government service, NGOs, factories or other work places - have been ordered to stay away from work; Hospitals are operating at less than a quarter of their potentials, restoring such previously ignored diseases as mainline killers. In other instances, basic health services no longer run, and people are living until they die. Now in our country, the most significant activity that keeps working is the search for food - to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the few instances where some work is going on, the preoccupation is on addressing the Ebola situation. Today, every newspaper story has an Ebola angle and every development grant is now directed at Ebola. Now, given the gravity of the Ebola situation and the risks involved with holding a normal celebration, the Press Union of Liberia has dedicated the observance of its 50th Anniversary to a nationwide Media Ebola Awareness Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are joining the rest of the people of Liberia in talking about the gravity of the Ebola situation, we also like to pay tribute to the men and women who, on this day in 1964, set forth the challenge to organize a body to protect the rights of journalists in this country, coordinate space for a free, independent and impartial media in Liberia, and at the same time chart their role in the development of the Liberian state, especially towards ensuring freedom of speech, the actualization of democracy and ensuring a guarantee of freedom, justice, equality and development in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task set forth by those our compatriots have today bloomed into a most respectable organization - which cannot be ignored in anything good that has come out of Liberia. While our notes will continuously refer to E. Reginald Townsend, Henry B. Cole, Chauncey Cooper, Aston King and J. Persey Gumel, I nonetheless like to reference Tuan Wreh, who would go on to become a professor of law, but especially because he has provided for Liberian journalism students one academic text that provides a clearer idea of what journalism was in the days the Press Union of Liberia was organized. I also noted the longevity of James E Dennis, who has survived his contemporaries, and has given us the opportunity to think of the men who led the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also like to recognize Kenneth Y. Best, who has remained in the newsroom, even at the ripe age of 75.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wouldn't forget T Nelson Williams, Sr, who led the organization of the Department of Mass Communications at the University of Liberia, providing for once an opportunity for Liberian journalists to gain academic qualifications here at home. But among all, our hero remains Stanton A. Peabody, who had the audacity to describe members of the House of Representatives in the best disposition of his thoughts, risking contempt and jail, raising the conviction of Liberian journalists to hold together and resist intolerance and alarm that speech must for once be free, especially within the realm of public service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regrettably, despite a revolutionary coup in 1980, a new democracy-based constitution in 1985, despite ravaging wars that reorganized the entire state in 1990 and again in 2003, the very contempt of 1964 remains ridiculously unclarified in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This simply says that the purpose of the Press Union of Liberia is just as relevant today (perhaps more) as it was 50 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across these years, the work of the Liberian media - now away from just newspapers and radio as in 1964 - has become even more challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights to freely speak, think and write - as guaranteed by the constitution have often been suppressed by various methods. At one point it was fancy to lock journalists up. As sensitivity grew and there is now the resort to court of laws to prevent that, other measures grew. Those have included shutting down, burning and in some instances torture and death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In more recent years, printing establishments were warned against printing certain papers, and as more papers have metamorphosed to owning printing presses, multiple, crime-based lawsuits are cropping up, with intent to shut down media houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In still other cases, media houses have been shut down on claims of hate crimes, and at times just short of sedition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all of these, our observation is that governments - in and out - have simply not come to grips with the reality that none can stop others from disagreeing in words, unless they have the capacity to stop others from thinking. Because the latter is impossible, efforts to prevent people from disagreeing is but a failed venture that only contributes to the evolution of conflict in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and Gentlemen:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that we have dedicated our 50th Anniversary to the fight against Ebola, we are keen not to get involved with rhetoric that will take over the recognition we are giving to the fight. Nonetheless, it is fair to note that the fight against Ebola can only succeed when the various parties are confident that we are all in it together. That means, principles are standard and do not sway from case to case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a situation here, where all Ebola deaths are buried en masse, and then burnt. Note is taken of the Ugandan Doctor from Redemption Hospital and the Catholic Priest. In the future - perhaps with better knowledge - some deaths are allowed special burial rites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, all unexplained deaths will be treated as Ebola deaths. A lot of loved ones were allowed to be carried away by a burial, then a burning team. At some point, the ratio changed, and the death certificates began. With deaths extending into the families of lost ones, an alarm has sounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While crying aloud about denial and traditional practices, and telling all relatives and friends to accept the Ebola reality, a new row has come forth when deaths in high quarters are cited to be Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be one standard that will instead get appreciation from all. Otherwise, those who have also doubted the circumstances of Ebola in the first place will always have reason to maintain their doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the Ebola situation has brought more challenge to the role of the media in reporting occurrences in our society. The state of emergency and yet unexplained restrictions introduces a tricky situation for a battle that must be fought inclusively. While media has pledged to work along in providing public education, the yet unknown keeps media in a position of fear, not sure of what happens next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all of these, the Press Union has become a victim, observing 50 years of existence with a closure of a fearless newspaper outside of due process. As difficult as we find this, we still look forward in confidence to a High Court ruling on a number of constitutional issues that will effectively open up the space for freedom and justice for journalists and others in the wider Liberian society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as we arrange the 50th anniversary, our admonition is for journalists to strengthen their drive into making their journalism one that tells the entire Liberian story in a factual and inclusive manner. Our admonition is for journalists to take the greater responsibility of making their journalism enviable, stepping up to the challenge to ensure opportunities for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, after 50 years, and after a number of transformation in Liberia, it is time that the government - including the legislature, the judiciary and of course the executive - take additional efforts to tolerate dissent and disagreement. This is the purpose of journalism, and of democracy and human rights. Appreciation of free expression is more of the issues and expressions that one find especially offensive. The wider the diversity in our thought and speech, the better we can work together to find a common ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will continue working to improve the quality of journalism in Liberia; We will continue with our self-regulatory mechanism to show greater accountability by Liberian journalists to their audience, but we demand that going beyond fifty years - there must be increased opportunities to make journalism the pivot of our democracy, our governance system and stretching out accountability in Liberian society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our disagreement with journalists should not be expressed through the power we wield, to the extent of violating rights and ignoring guarantees of freedom and accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank You!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Montserrado County District#9 Representative Munah Pelham-Youngblood has donated an ambulance and several consignments of Ebola Materials to the District # 9 Anti-Ebola Task Force to swiftly deal with the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus Disease that has plagued the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Wednesday at the official launching of the District #9 Anti-Ebola Taskforce held at the Don Bosco Youth Center in New Matadi, Rep. Youngblood said the issue of this deadly virus is gradually getting out of control, while Liberian residents continue to die with medical facilities in the country not fully operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think it is unfortunately sad,&quot; Representative Youngblood noted, saying, &quot;... now that we have a state of emergency [and the situation is blown out of proportion] all eyes are on Liberia, the money is coming from everywhere, yet our people are still dying while the nation is faced with many challenges that has to do with fighting the deadly Ebola Virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wondered, &quot;What can we do as citizens to help ourselves? Up to present, the death toll has increased; this tells me the government's strategy needs to be revisited and more robust [efforts be applied] in the fight against Ebola. The representative called for a change of attitude on the part of Liberians and noted how some believe that Ebola is real while others don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hear Representative Youngblood: But I say to those who still do not believe that Ebola is real; can't you see that this disease is a silent killer? She further drilled her audience with Ebola sensitization messages, saying, &quot;The disease is real; it kills our love ones, family and friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some others believe that this disease will soon get over, she notwithstanding admonished members of the task force to observe the basic components by strictly adhering to the constant hand washing, sanitation and hygiene tips. She averred that Liberians need to stop the lies to fight against this virus, stressing that lies shall make the people perish and only the truth shall set us free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Youngblood urged Citizens of District # 9 to stop being in a state of denial as Ebola is real; she also admonished them to stop hiding the deaths of love ones or friends to help save another family's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Be able to accept education in prevention, listen to the health workers, take your own precaution; stay away from hug, kissing, body fluids and together you constantly wash your hands,&quot; she further sensitized her constituents. The launch of the Anti-Ebola activities were held under the theme, &quot;Don't Be Ashamed, Keep Safe, Ebola is real&quot; with Motto: Report It.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event brought together the House Speaker Alex Tyler, the Montserrado County Superintendent Florence Brandy, Youths and Sports Minister Len Eugene Nagbe, the Central Bank Governor Mills Jones among others dignitaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A PATIENT in the United States was diagnosed with Ebola last night - the first case outside Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said they were trying to contact people who had been in contact with the unnamed patient in Texas over a period of several days when he could have been infectious.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who was not a health care worker, arrived in Texas on a plane from Liberia on Sept 20 to visit members of his family. According to one report, he may have contracted the disease from an infected fruit bat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He showed no symptoms when he arrived and only started to become sick four days later. Two days after that, he sought medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sept 28 he was placed in isolation at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and Ebola was diagnosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Thomas Frieden, the director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the diagnosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was the first case diagnosed outside Africa during the current outbreak which has killed more than 3,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US medical officials are working to identify all those who had close contact with the man while he was infectious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop feverish symptoms. If they do, they will be isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Frieden said: &quot;This is the first patient diagnosed outside Africa, to our knowledge, with this strain of Ebola. The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation, this case, of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is certainly possible someone who had contact, a family member or someone else, may contract Ebola. But there is no doubt in my mind we will stop it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Ultimately, we are all connected by the air we breathe and we are invested in making sure this disease is controlled in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola is a scary disease and we are really hoping for the recovery of this individual. But we are stopping it in its tracks in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if the patient was an American citizen, Dr Frieden said only: &quot;He was visiting family members who live in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor said that people who were on the plane with the patient were not at risk because he was not feverish at that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of US medical workers who contracted Ebola during the West African outbreak have previously been treated in the US after being flown home in isolated conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola causes a range of symptoms including fever, muscle aches, vomiting and bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be spread by close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms, or by touching the corpse of a person who died from the disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK will spend a further &pound;20m on the care of Ebola patients and prevention of the disease in Sierra Leone, in addition to the &pound;100m it has already committed, the government has announced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extra funding from the Department for International Development comes before an international conference called by the UK and Sierra Leonean governments in London tomorrow to discuss what other countries can do to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the money was needed to keep basic health services running, as well as allowing hard-pressed aid agencies to continue to help Ebola victims and fight the spread of disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Britain is working urgently with Sierra Leone to scale up the international response to the disease,&quot; said Greening. &quot;Last month Britain pledged to support 700 treatment beds in Sierra Leone, but keeping basic public health services running is vital to halt the spread of the disease. Our latest support will allow stretched medical staff and aid agencies to prevent further infection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new money was announced as a rare piece of good news on Ebola emerged from the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC), which said the outbreak in Nigeria was probably over. When Patrick Sawyer, an American who flew to Lagos from Liberia in July, was taken ill and died, there were fears that the epidemic would sweep through the capital and Port Harcourt, where one of Sawyer's contacts fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC said swift and effective action in tracing the contacts of the two men had paid off. Only three out of 900 contacts are still in the 21-day incubation period and that expires tomorrow. There have been 20 cases in the country and eight deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal is also clear of Ebola. It had just one confirmed case - a man who travelled from Guinea - but immediate action by the health ministry, which was prepared for the eventuality, led to the successful tracing of all 67 of his contacts. All are now out of the virus incubation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the three badly affected countries and, in particular, Sierra Leone and Liberia, there is no sign of a respite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is major concern at the rate of increase in Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, where the UK is taking the lead. At the moment, every 10 people with Ebola will pass the infection to 17 more. To bring the infection rate down, it is necessary to get medical care to people much faster, before they become highly infectious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small tented facilities are to be set up on a trial basis in areas where there has never been healthcare or it has broken down, with the aim of encouraging people who have symptoms such as fever to come for basic care. Those who test positive for Ebola will be isolated and could be moved to a hospital bed, if there is one available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supermarkets continue to slide as Sainsbury disappoints, while miners fall on China data</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading shares fell back for the third day running, with the FTSE 100 hitting levels not seen since April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FTSE 100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> finished at 6557.52, down 65.20 or 0.98%, as the wealth of bad news continued to unsettle investors. As well as the continuing concerns about the repercussions of protests in Hong Kong and the air strikes on Isis, there were renewed signs of weakness in the global economy from the latest purchasing managers manufacturing surveys. Data from China, the UK, Germany and the US all disappointed investors, ahead of the key European Central Bank meeting on Thursday and US non-farm payroll figures on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slide accelerated during the afternoon as Wall Street reacted badly to news of the first positive diagnosis of the Ebola virus in the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airline shares came under pressure on fears the spread of the disease could hinder air travel, with British Airways and Iberia owner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">International Airlines Group</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> down 9.9p to 357.2p and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">easyJet</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 27p lower at &pound;13.96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mining shares fell back after the data from China, a key consumer of commodities, showed a flat performance from the manufacturing sector in September. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Anglo American</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost 20.5p to 1363.5p and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Antofagasta</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was 19p lower at 702p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's plunge in the oil price - linked to the continuing strength of the dollar in the expectation of US interest rate rises - has also affected others in the commodities sector. Despite Brent crude recovering 1% to $95.6 a barrel, the recent falls below $100 have unsettled investors in oil companies. So </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tullow Oil</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slipped 13.5p to 631p while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Royal Dutch Shell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A shares dropped 27.5p to &pound;23.31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BG</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell 47p to &pound;10.93, not helped by Credit Suisse cutting its price target to &pound;10.50 from &pound;11.15 and warning of the production risks in Brazil and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of this has stopped talk of consolidation in the sector. US coal giant Walter Energy was rumoured to be in the sights - again - of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">BHP Billiton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, down 24.5p at 1690.5p, or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rio Tinto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 11.5p lower at &pound;30.20. In 2012 BHP was said to be mulling a $55 a share bid, but now the purported price was just $5 a share, still double the current market price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supermarkets continued to be out of favour. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">J Sainsbury</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost 17.5p to 234p after it cut its full year sales forecastand said it would assess its dividend policy as part of a strategic review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tesco</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell 6p to 180.2p after it said the Financial Conduct Authority had launched a full investigation into the accounting scandal at the supermarket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Morrisons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was also down, 8.4p lower at 159.9p although 4p of that was due to the shares going ex-dividend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock markets are selling off fast as the first day of October gets off on the wrong foot...Global indices are in retreat as confidence in the world economy evaporates and investors pull back their positions ahead of major events in Europe and America this week. Across Europe eyes have turned to the ECB meeting tomorrow. The data points to a need for central bank action but the reaction in markets seems to indicate that there are a lot of worried people out there, worried because of the fear that the ECB will do little beyond fine words. In the UK there is plenty to be concerned about too - manufacturing is weaker, Sainsbury's sales are diving and the FCA has turned its focus on to Tesco. The feelings have manifested themselves in steep losses on the FTSE 100, and until some positive news emerges from somewhere the selling is likely to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But following its recent falls,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Royal Mail </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">recovered 7.5p to 399.7p as UBS raised its recommendation from sell to neutral with a 400p price target,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the mid-caps, events company </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">UBM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dropped 34.5p to 548.5p after it said it would buy US trade show organiser Advanstar Communications for $972m, funded by a &pound;563m ($912m) cash call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But estate agency group </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Countrywide</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> climbed 16.6p to 468p as it unveiled a share buyback programme for up to &pound;20m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil and gas producer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Afren</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> added 5.9p to 109.4p after it said late on Tuesday that an independent review revealed no further unauthorised payments, following a review which began in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower down the market </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Graphene NanoChem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> jumped 7.125p to 45.25p after announcing a second order for its product line for the oilfield chemicals market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, broker </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Daniel Stewart</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw its shares suspended at 0.35p after it said it had been unable to publish its annual accounts within the six month time limit required by Aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company - a nominated advisor itself to many Aim companies and with 800,000 private clients - said in July it would make a loss for the year but had seen an improvement in the second half. It added then:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first quarter, to 30 June 2014, saw a further improvement in activity during which we completed a number of small secondary fundraisings. Our current pipeline gives us encouraging visibility through the remainder of the half year, subject always to the successful completion of these opportunities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management of the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) says it is challenged by the lack of logistics to properly deliver the services needed as the Ebola virus continues to rage in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Managing Director for Technical Services, Mr. Perkins Cassell said the Corporation lacks vehicles, sewer trucks and other equipment needed to work on the Corporation's pipelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cassell said as a member of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) consortium both locally and internationally, it is the prerogative of the Corporation to fight the Ebola scourge which had since engulfed the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cassell said although Ebola is not water borne disease, there are other diseases such as diarrhea, cholera and other relative infections which must be fought with the availability of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that with the help of the Corporation's international partners the institution has launched a program co-named WASH Ebola Away which will enable the entity to take the lead in providing disinfectants to Government ministries and agencies to disinfect their respective buildings and sanitation at an appreciable level as the fight against the Ebola virus continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cassell, speaking at a news conference on Monday with the Corporation's Managing Director, Mr. Charles Allen said the LWSC has installed a mobile water facility provided by two of the entity's international partners with the capacity to pump 10,000 gallons of water daily while four additional mobile water facilities had been shipped to Liberia by the Corporation's partners. He said these four mobile water facilities will be placed at selective locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LWSC Technical boss said the entity is working with the United Nations Children Fund(UNICEF), other related agencies and making efforts to ensure the constant supply of water from the White Plains Water treatment Plant outside Monrovia but wondered how this can continuously be done without the needed logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prior to the Liberian Civil War, the LWSC had ten operational centers throughout the country and efforts were underway to revitalize some of these facilities but Ebola erupted and things had to come to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LWSC Managing Director, Mr. Charles Allen said the Corporation is a state enterprise and its about time that government improves its capacity to deliver services to the Liberian people. He reminded Liberians that their attempt to transform the country, water cannot be a secondary issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the corporation had received 200 pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and had established an isolation center for treatment of waste and extended water services to Rock Hills community in Paynesville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen said the LWSC will establish a' logistical base in Paynesville to identify over 10,000 illegal customers that are using the Corporation's water resources without any payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He vowed to disconnect those illegal customers and assured them that reconnection will be impossible, saying, &quot;We will extend this exercise to all angles of Monrovia&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) yesterday observed its 50th anniversary by intensifying its awareness campaign on the fight against the spread of the Ebola virus which continues to claim the lives of Liberians and other nationals. Unlike previous years where there were elaborate programs such as parades and indoor programs, the Union this year decided to depart from that tradition because of the Ebola epidemic that had hit the country since March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its awareness campaign yesterday, the Union set up two separate delegations that visited Kakata, Margibi County and Tubmanburg in Bomi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our reporter who traveled with the PUL delegation to Kakata, Margibi County, the Union's Vice President, Jallah Grayfield, led the team on the Ebola awareness campaign which took the delegation to every angle of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Grayfield spoke of the treatment rendered to the daughter of Representative Edward Forh who died after being refused at the JFK Hospital in Monrovia and stressed the need for health workers to be life-savers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the PUL Awareness campaign, the delegation also identified with the family of Madam Cecelia Fallah, a lady who had succumbed to the virus by donating a bag of rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PUL delegation consoled Madam Fallah's family as her husband is being treated in the Ebola Isolation center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tubmanburg, the PUL delegation, led by the Union's President, K. Adbullah Kamara donated food items to the Bomi Radio Station and listened to Ebola stories as being experienced by survivals in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Union climaxed the celebration on Ashmun Street where members reflected on the current state of affairs especially the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) was founded in1964 when the late journalist, Stanton Peabody was arrested for a story he wrote and journalists in the country felt that they should forge a common front to advocate for their rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">591 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MANAGEMENT OF the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) says it is challenged by the lack of logistics to properly deliver the services needed as the Ebola virus continues to rage in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DEPUTY MANAGING Director for Technical Services, Mr. Perkins Cassell said the Corporation lacks vehicles, sewer trucks and other equipment needed to work on the Corporation's pipelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CASSELL SAID as a member of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) consortium both locally and internationally, it is the prerogative of the Corporation to fight the Ebola scourge which had since engulfed the country. Mr. Cassell said although Ebola is not water borne disease, there are other diseases such as diarrhea, cholera and other relative infections which must be fought with the availability of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE DISCLOSED THAT with the help of the Corporation's international partners the institution has launched a program co-named WASH Ebola Away which will enable the entity to take the lead in providing disinfectants to Government ministries and agencies to disinfect their respective buildings and sanitation at an appreciable level as the fight against the Ebola virus continues. Mr. Cassell, speaking at a news conference on Monday with the Corporation's Managing Director, Mr. Charles Allen said the LWSC has installed a mobile water facility provided by two of the entity's international partners with the capacity to pump 10,000 gallons of water daily while four additional mobile water facilities had been shipped to Liberia by the Corporation's partners. He said these four mobile water facilities will be placed at selective locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE LWSC MANAGING Director, Mr. Charles Allen said the Corporation is a state enterprise and it's about time that government improves its capacity to deliver services to the Liberian people. He reminded Liberians that their attempt to transform the country; water cannot be a secondary issue. He said the Corporation have received 200 pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and have established an isolation center for treatment of waste and extended water services to RockHills community in Paynesville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THIS CRITICAL time when the entire country is engulfed with the fight against Ebola, Government should in no easy way forget about empowering the LWSC knowing that the water which they provide is a serious commodity of life which is very useful to human existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Ebola is not water borne disease, it is an open secret that there are other water borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera which must be contained because they are among the signs and symptoms of the Ebola virus. Water which is used to wash hands or enhance the entire sanitation process should be of a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS IN this vein that we are calling on the requisite authorities to prioritize making more funding available to the LWSC to help enhance its work which include but not limited to ensuring a good sanitation and a conducive environment that is free of Ebola. Water is life and if the LWSC must perform her statutory duties, policy makers should not support the entity while there is Ebola but beyond the time of the Ebola scourge to ensure the proper disposal of wastes coming through the sewage system and if possible advance the sewage treatment station in Fiamah, Sinkor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO ACHIEVE THIS goal, the procurement of logistical equipment such as vehicles, sewage trucks and other accessories should be cardinal. Hence, all efforts must be put on deck to empower the LWSC for prompt service to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff association of Ecobank Liberia Limited under the banner &quot;Ecobank Social &amp; Athletic Club or ESAC&quot; yesterday buttressed the efforts of government in combating and containing the spread of Ebola in the country by making donations to hospitals and five media institutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Good Will Hospital and Hope for Women International in Fiamah and Paynesville received the assorted sanitary materials to include soap, Clorox; buckets, powder detergent among others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ESAC Jackson explained that despite the current difficulties in terms of hospitals refusing to administer medication, Good Will Hospital and Hope for Women International were embracing the challenges by providing medication to Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the actions by the two hospitals to remained open and administer medication to people has restored of hopes of Liberians who are seeking other medication in the midst of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson put the cost of the donations at over sixty thousand Liberian dollars. He said the monies were provided by members of ESAC who are within the fifteen counties of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that plans are also underway for donations to be made to other medical institutions across the country. He called on other referral hospital to join the fight of national government so that Ebola can be contain and defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, the Medical Director of Hope for Women International Dr. Willimena Jallah lauded ESAC for the gesture, promising that it will be use for the intended purpose. Doctor Jallah said the hospital was in dire need of sanitary materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She encouraged ESAC executives to keep a distance to people who are showing signs of constant fever, adding those who are treated for fever and keep experiencing it should remain at their homes and seek medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the Proprietor of Good Will Clinic Doctor Edward G. David also lauded ESAC for the donation. He added that the clinic is running its normal medical activities in the wake of Ebola. Dr. David believes that Ebola can be defeated in the soonest possible time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is mounting public concern that the state broadcaster, the Liberia Broadcasting System (LBS) could go off the air at a time when the public needs more information relative to the fight against Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several citizens who spoke to the INQUIRER intimated that by going off the air, the station which has been in the vanguard of disseminating government's information to the people has fallen short of doing its job at this critical time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizens noted that the station as a state owned entity should be funded by government to better serve the country in terms of information dissemination especially that, which comes from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They further stressed that at a time when the country is fighting the deadly Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), government should do all within its power to ensure that the station which is the only government's owned be opened and operative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many expressed frustration that government entities that have nothing to do with the fight against the Ebola virus were given huge sum of money while the state broadcaster that is in the business of educating the populace about the deadly disease is left undone in term of financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government does not mean business to fight Ebola if they cannot support a station like LBS letting it to go off the air because of the lack of fuel while they are indirectly supporting privately operated station. This trend must change now if the fight against the virus must gain grounds,&quot; a university student said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is LBS that usually carry the daily Ebola Press Conference at the Ministry of Information to the public through their live broadcast. However due to the fact that the station is off the air, we are sitting and not getting the latest information relative to the fight against the Ebola virus,&quot; a school teacher who is at home due to the closure of schools intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview yesterday, the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Liberia Broadcasting System (LBS), Professor Weade Kobbah Wreh, said it is unfortunate that the state broadcaster could go off the air at this crucial time in the history of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Wreh said it is pathetic that the state owned station could go off the air at this time of the country's history when everyone needs information to protect themselves from the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said by statue, government should be providing sixty percent of the cost to run the station but expressed regret that the station could go off the air due to the lack of fuel and budgetary support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Kobbah Wreh said the Board of Directors is expected to meet soon and discuss the matter, adding, &quot;People made promises to support the station but failed to live up to their promises. The Minister of Finance is a member of the board&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stated further that LBS is a state-owned entity and that it's the responsibility of the state to support the up- keep of the station at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contracted recently, the Director General of LBS, Mr. Ambrose Nmah, said the station was off the air because of the lack of fuel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Francis Korkpor has urged magistrates in Monrovia and its environs to use their discretionary powers when handling cases at this time of Liberia's critical period and that everyone needs to join in the national fight against the spread of Ebola in their respective positions and portfolio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice, who met with his magistrates yesterday to discuss ways to find options to detention during the Ebola crisis, said it is time that they make maximum use of the safeguard under the law which provides options for arrests and detentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He read Sections 10.12 and 13.5 of the Criminal Procedure Law which gives discretionary powers in cases and urged the judges in the courts of non records to exercise such powers at this time especially on a case by case basis given the facts and circumstances prevailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the magistrates to exercise this power prudently because it is only hard core criminals that should be in jail thereby encouraging them to exercise options and noted that when one prays for a writ of arrest, it is depended upon the courts to adjudge that summon is rather necessary especially in bailable offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Korkpor said the rigid requirement of bonds should not take precedence over the substance of the case and also appealed to the public defenders to work with the judges to keep people out of prisons at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Keep the law and let us do our part. Our nation needs us most. I am not saying that people should not be sent to jail but we should not be the ones to add more to their frustration. During these times of Ebola, we are in favor of the suspension of jury trial and opting for bench trial because we understand that the mode of transmission is in public gathering too,&quot; he told the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Judiciary must take steps to complement the national effort in stopping the spread of Ebola and one way that can be done is when the prison cells are decongested. The Chief Justice also spoke about timeliness of magistrates in their various courtrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned the magistrates not to embarrass him because court inspectors will from time to time be sent into the various courtrooms and to find a magistrate absent without a tangible excuse will be tantamount to serious punishment that will not be based on friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice said everyone must take Ebola seriously and lawyers are of no exception because if everyone gets overwhelmed there will be no State to govern and expressed that it is upon everyone to remind themselves that of the grave nature of the virus as each one takes every preventive measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the role of the lawyers is very difficult because even in a State of Emergency, courts must remain opened adding that suspension of court is not covered during such emergency and it is incumbent upon magistrates to go to work at all times including Saturdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said judges are not non essential staff because it is only non essential staffs that are requested to stay at home due to the Ebola and the risk involved in crowdedness adding, &quot;Our services are needed most and we must be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Assistant Education Minister for Early Childhood Education, Madam Felicia Doe Somah, told a news conference yesterday that the Ministry of Education has no control as to when schools will be opened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However she noted that the Ministry was working on the new calendar for the opening of schools and planning a new curriculum that will come into force immediately when schools are ordered open by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the new calendar will include the washing of hands at school campuses and further disclosed that efforts are underway for regular cleaning of school buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Doe Somah said this will be done to ensure that when schools are ordered open, students will return on campuses that are environmentally safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stressed that the Ministry is working to refurbish schools, provide teachers with Ebola awareness and train members of the Parent Teachers Association (PTA) to cope with the opening of schools after a prolonged closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Education Ministry official also disclosed that a meeting is being planned for this Thursday following which the result of the West African Examination Council (WAEC) will be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Somah said the Ministry is in the process of introducing a community learning program on radio which will not only benefit school going children but the general public and initiate some psycho- social counseling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also told the news conference held at the Ministry of Information that the Ministry of Education intends to supply schools with anti-Ebola materials which will enable them sanitize school buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the news conference, the Director General of the General Services Agency (GSA) Madam Mary Broh disclosed that the call-center which is located at the compound of the GSA is getting better and responding quickly to calls and inquiries coming to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Broh who is a member of the National Ebola Task Forces said to further speed up the response process, the health team, members of the Red Cross that is responsible for burial are all located near the call-center in the compound of the GSA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Broh also informed the public that the distribution of food to quarantine centers is ongoing in a very satisfactory manner and noted that whenever the food in stock is distributed, the World food program always replenish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official launch of the Ebola Awareness of District # 7 in Montserrado County, under the Theme, &quot;Kicking Ebola Out of District # 7&quot;was held during the weekend at the Matilda Newport Junior &amp; Senior High School Auditorium on Newport Street in Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the launch, Representative Solomon George cautioned his constituents to always embrace the construction of an Ebola Treatment Centers in their communities because according to him it was for the good of everybody. &quot;We were elected by you so that we may reason for you, so give us the chance for us to do just that,&quot; he urged them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District # 7 Representative also admonished his people to stop the denial adding that Ebola is indeed real and that it kills instantly when instructions from health authorities are ignored. He stated further that if a family member is suspected of being sick constantly, then the Health Team should be alerted timely and cautioned his people to avoid all forms of entertainment during this health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then frowned on those who were in the habit of using canoes to dump Ebola corpses in the sea and after fishes eat them, the same fishes are being caught by fishermen and sold to customers, most of whom are business women. &quot;This unwholesome act undoubtedly poses potential threat to our health,&quot; he intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting LD$150,000.00 which he noted was government's support toward the campaign to Burgess Houston, General Coordinator, District # 7 Ebola Task Force, the Monstserrado District Seven Representative then pointed out that the District Ebola Task Force will manage the funds based on what he described as their plan and report later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also informed the gathering that the task force also received 10 bags of 25kg rice which he said was donated by Representative Haja Siryon of Bomi County and clarified that it will be given to the task force so as to enhance their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burgess Houston, General Coordinator said kicking Ebola out of District Seven, Monstserrado County should remind those who he divulged were trained recently to be aware that the awareness will be taken from 'Door- To- Door' in the four thousand and seven hundred homes that have been earmarked in the district. &quot;Since you are trained we also expect you to train others as regards to the preventative measures, case finding and contact tracing, &quot; Mr. Houston said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Coordinator however pointed out that the task force will be working along with the health workers whom he stated will be carrying out tests on the people. He then asked each and every member of the task force to apply seriousness when executing their responsibility so that he virus can be defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, Madam Florence Brandy, Superintendent of Monserrado County said that the LD$150,000.00 was government's initial support toward the fight against the Ebola virus in the district. She then disclosed that each and every district in Montserrado County was benefiting from similar support from the government, adding, &quot;We also cater to health workers so that they can work for the people because we are using their money; nobody is misusing money,&quot; she declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking further, Madam Brandy emphatically stated that the awareness campaign was not intended to promote anybody but to sincerely battle the virus void of politics and she also encouraged community dwellers to inform the task force when any of their family member is sick or even dead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, residents of the Rock Spring Community which has been one of the hard hit communities of the deadly Ebola virus launched its Ebola Task Force and conducted a one-day workshop to enlighten citizens on the danger of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the community Chairman, Mr. Joseph Kannah said this Ebola Task Force will work in collaboration with the district's Ebola Task Force and the National Ebola Task Force to enhance the smooth operation of the Health team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kannah disclosed that the Rock Spring Community has been affected greatly by this deadly Ebola virus with about 16 deaths and over 80 persons quarantined in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the program, Mr. Kannah said residents who attended the workshop should consider themselves as ambassadors in telling others the danger of the Ebola virus and also expressed his concerns about stigmatizing those who were considered Ebola suspects but later released by the Health team in the various communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony which was expected to have been graced by some top officials of Government, Businessmen and women was poorly attended at the G.W. Gibson High school on the Capitol By-Pass in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Emmanuel Jones, a launcher at the ceremony said the Ebola virus is not a political issue but a national health crisis that everybody needs to take the initiative to sensitize other people and avoid the issue of denying that the virus exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Jones, making a contribution of USD200 to the community Ebola Task Force said he is willing to work with them to help sustain the over 80 persons who were considered Ebola suspects but has already been quarantined by the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the launch, Representative Acarous Gray said, &quot;More than 16 people are believed to have died from the current epidemic in the Rock Spring Community, 88 already quarantined and three deaths amongst health workers in the district.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Acarous Gray arrived at the end of the launch lauded residents of the Rock Spring Community for launching an Ebola Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it is regrettable, frustrating and disheartening to see some residents in his district who are still involved with sporting activities and social gathering and not following the preventive measures provided by the Ministry of Health to protect them against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Gray said last Thursday the District Ebola Task Force was also launched to enhance remote and quarantine communities to get food and clean water and that will also help to carry on some sanitization efforts to assist reduce the spread of the deadly Ebola virus that is claiming the lives of many people in district 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Gray pledged 15,000 Liberian dollars as a support to the community Ebola Task Force which was to be picked up yesterday but said the proceeds for the launch should be used for the intended purpose and not for personal gain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference held at the United States Embassy in Monrovia yesterday, Ambassador Malac disclosed that the U.S. Army has come with additional capacity to join with other international partners to fight the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, Major General Darryl Williams, Commanding General/Joint Forces Command, United Assistance said the numbers of US soldiers are in Liberia to fill the gap and accomplish the mission that they came for.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the Government of Liberia has approved that the medical center should be built in Margibi County for health workers only and that the medical center will not be used because health workers are needed at the Ebola Treatment Units to save lives.</SPAN></P>

He said people should not wait for the disease to get worse before going to the treatment unit and reminded Liberians that the virus has no cure, so it is better to admit that one has the disease at an early stage than to deny it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the U.S. Africa Command has disclosed that it will set up a Joint Force Command headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia, to provide regional command and control support to U.S. military activities and facilitate coordination with U.S. government and international relief efforts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">980 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia has signed its first three groundbreaking contract agreements with key implementing partners for the US$52m Ebola Emergency Response operation that is intended to accelerate Liberia's response to the Ebola epidemic across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the ceremony held at the newly established Ebola Crisis Response Center Thursday in Sinkor, Finance and Development Planning Minister Amara Konneh said the contractual agreements with key development partners including the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Food Program, and the United Nations Office of Project Services will support the provision of critical and much needed goods and services in the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus Disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the agreement will support the interventions of these organizations through the resources that will be directed toward preventing the further spread of the disease through community outreach and awareness, and ensuring that the bodies of those who have succumbed to Ebola are disposed of with dignity and respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh said the US$52m grant was provided by the World Bank to underwrite the cost of running existing Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) for the next six months; setting up new ones quickly; and ensuring that our medical personnel and our patients have everything they need to fight this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grant forms part of the US$200 million Ebola emergency mobilization first announced by the World Bank Group in early August. The WBG said that its new Ebola Emergency Response project mobilized US$52 million for Liberia, the country with the highest number of Ebola infections, US$28 million for Sierra Leone, and US$25 million for Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia remains immensely grateful to the healthcare professionals who have committed themselves to the fight against Ebola, despite all threats to their lives and that of their families, Minister Konneh disclosed and added that government in turn, remains committed to the safety and fair compensation of these health workers, as demonstrated by the adequate provision in this program, for hazard payments to health workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treasury Chief furthered that Government is keen on increasing access to healthcare for Ebola and non-Ebola patients across Liberia as efforts to eradicate the deadly virus continues unabated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WB grant supports the efforts by increasing supply of Personal protective equipment (PPEs); and provides for the establishment of ETUs in Fish Town, River Gee, while supporting current operations at John FK Medical Center, ELWA Hospital, Island Clinic, Bong and Foya Treatment Centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said six (6) new ambulances and other vehicles provided under this grant will ensure that patients will receive quicker response and get access to health facilities with water and sanitation services to ensure that health workers and patients will care and be care for in a clean and dignified environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh thanked the partners for their supports during this crucial time. &quot;We thank you for responding to our call as quickly as you have, and for aligning yourselves to the priorities we have set in order to resolve this crisis in an efficient and well-coordinated manner,&quot; the Treasury Chief pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health and Social Welfare Minister Dr. Walter Gwenigale thanked Liberia's development partners for the level of support being provided by the country to respond to the Ebola outbreak. This support, he noted, will strengthen the capacity of the Government and partners to respond adequately towards containing the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Graaff, WHO Country Representative recognized the government of Liberia for its unwavering commitment to protect lives in the wake of the Ebola outbreak. The WHO official thanked the World bank for making grant available in a short period. He added that with the signing, &quot;We can move to implementation and it means we would be able to bring in the supplies needed to fight the disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks delivered on behalf of the World Bank Liberia Country Manager Inguna Dobraja, the Bank's Senior Country Economist in Liberia, Timothy Bulman assured the Government and people of Liberia that the Bank will continue to stand with them during this difficult period of Liberia's existence - fighting the Ebola epidemic. &quot;We will continue to work with the Government and other development partners to respond to the Ebola epidemic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged the landmark signing of contracts with key agencies was indeed significant due to the consolidation of resources, technical expertise and other response efforts that will facilitate the scaling up of response efforts against the Ebola epidemic in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministries of Finance and Development Planning, Health and Social Welfare, and Agriculture of Liberia worked as one team to convene development partners to develop an investment plan for the World Bank funds, he disclosed. According to Mr. Bulman, the investment plan addresses the country's immediate priorities, including the support to Ebola treatment units (ETUs), revitalization of essential health services, risk allowances to Ebola workers and health workers under high-risk environment, surveillance and social mobilization, and food and water supply to quarantined and Ebola-affected households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the plan, the Government of Liberia contracts out a part of the implementation of the investment plan to UN Agencies with specific technical and operational strengths. For example, WHO supports the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other technical services, UNICEF procures essential drugs and supplies and provides water supplies, WFP provides food to quarantined and Ebola-affected population, and UNOPS supports the procurement of ambulances. This was a truly collaborative effort under the leadership of the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. military C-17s landed at Roberts International Airport over the weekend carrying key pieces of U.S. military equipment to aid in the anti-Ebola fight: two mobile Ebola testing labs and equipment to build the 25-bed field hospital for health care workers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mobile labs will be placed at the Ebola Treatment Centers (ETUs) at Island Clinic and in Bong County, and are expected to be operational this week. The labs are a huge step in stopping the spread of Ebola because they reduce the time needed to determine if a patient has Ebola from several days to just a few hours. The labs will be operated by members of a U.S. Navy Medical Research Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25-bed hospital arrived as U.S. Seabees broke ground on the hospital site in Margibi County. Originally designed to treat military service members in combat zones, the facility will be staffed by the U.S. Public Health Service and will be used to care for health workers in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25-bed hospital and mobile testing labs are part of the U.S. effort to help the government of Liberia and other Ebola-affected countries contain the Ebola virus, save lives and alleviate human suffering. Other U.S. activities include setting up a logistics base to facilitate the flow of military personnel, supplies, and equipment into the affected region, helping to build 17 Ebola treatment units, and training for hundreds of health care workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. government agency overseeing the overall U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The U.S. military response, led by Major General Darryl Williams, Commanding General of U.S. Army Africa, is acting in support of the USAID-led Disaster Assistance Response Team by providing expertise in command and control, engineering and logistics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's staff association has donated to hospitals and five media institutions. The Good Will Hospital and Hope for Women International in Fiamah and Paynesville received assorted sanitary materials including soap, clorox; buckets, powder detergent, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five media institutions also received fuel oil. The institutions include Radio Kartoma ten gallons fuel oil; Radio Voinjama five gallons fuel, Radio Kakata five gallons fuel oil, Radio Gbarnga five gallons fuel oil and Super Bongese Radio five gallons fuel oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the items, ESAC President Trokon R. Jackson said his organization was glad to identify with the hospitals during a time of national emergency. According to Jackson, the two referral centers have done extremely well in recent times to ensure that lives are saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that despite the current difficulties, Good Will Hospital and Hope for Women International were embracing the challenges by providing medication to Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the actions by the two hospitals to remain opened and administer medication to people have restored the hopes of Liberians who are seeking other medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson put the cost of the donations at over sixty thousand Liberian dollars. He said the funds were provided by members of ESAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that plans are also underway for donations to be made to other medical institutions across the country. He called on other referral hospital to join the fight of national government so that Ebola can be contained and defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, the Medical Director of Hope for Women International Dr. Willimena Jallah lauded ESAC for the gesture, promising that it will be used for the intended purpose. Jallah said the hospital was in dire need of sanitary materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She encouraged ESAC executives to keep a distance from people who are showing signs of constant fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the Proprietor of Good Will Clinic Doctor Edward G. David also lauded ESAC for the donation. He added that the clinic is running its normal medical activities in the wake of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. David believes that Ebola can be defeated in the soonest possible time. He called on philanthropists to complement the efforts of government so that the country can return to its previous status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Studies have shown that it is less likely for people working in Ebola Treatment Units to be infected with the Ebola virus disease (EVD), an authority at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services and Chair of the Incident Management System (IMS) Tolbert Nyenswah said the studies showed that most of those, mainly healthcare workers who contract the virus were infected with the EVD outside the ETUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism (MICAT) daily Ebola update press briefing in Monrovia, Nyenswah said this is so because of the rigorous infectious control mechanism that are put in place at the ETUs for those working in there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've emphasized on infectious prevention and control with rigorous training and supervision to reinforce the practice that keeps health workers safe in the Ebola Treatment Unit... &quot; Minister Nyenswah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was sad that some healthcare workers continue to be infected with the EVD in other sectors of the country and not the ETUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister clarified that Ebola Treatment Units should not be considered as 'death trap' as studies have proven the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if the EVD transmission must be stopped, community members should ensure that people suspected of the virus are safely transported to avoid endangering more lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said due to this reason, the government has made available four additional ambulances to the Montserrado County response team, increasing the number of ambulances to 12 for swift and timely response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that ambulances which are now deployed in the 12 zones of Montserrado County will help transport suspected Ebola patients to ETUs safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is suspected or probable case of Ebola in your community, we should try as much as possible to only use ambulances that are operated by trained personnel to transport the Ebola patients to Ebola Treatment facilities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the transportation of suspected Ebola patients in taxis and other public transport services pose risk to people in the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the public have repeatedly been seen transporting Ebola suspected patients and corpses in commercial vehicles. They have constantly blamed the situation to the lack of ambulances and slow responses from the National Task Force on Ebola to either pack up sick people or bodies from the communities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gbarpolu County has registered its first case of the Ebola disease with a 14-year-old boy confirmed positive with the virus. Medical authorities in the county told the Liberia news Agency that the boy contracted the virus from his father who reportedly died of the disease in Parker Farm in Gbarma District.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities said several family members of the boy, including his mother, have been quarantined in the same area by the County Ebola Task Force to avoid the spread of the disease to other parts of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Task Force, the boy was confirmed Ebola positive when the result from his blood specimen test was received by medical authorities working with the Task Force recently. The authorities said modalities are being worked out by the Task Force to have the boy transferred to the new Ebola Center at the old Island Clinic on the Bushrod Island for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Task Force has set up the Gbarma District Ebola Task Force to handle all Ebola related cases. The district task force comprises of the surveillance, health, burial and awareness teams. In a related development, Gbarpolu County Ebola Task Force has closed its side of the border at the Marwa River with Bong County for one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Trokon Washington, the Task Force reached the decision Thursday during its weekly meeting held in Bopolu City. Dr. Washington, a member of the Ebola Task Force, said the crossing point was closed due to the outbreak of the Ebola disease in the Marwa area in Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that to ensure that people do not enter the county by the river security forces have been deployed and mandated not to allow entry via the river from Bong into Gbarpolu. Meanwhile, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) Civil Affairs Division in Bopolu has begun construction work on an Ebola Holding Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNMIL last month agreed to undertake the project in collaboration with the County Ebola Task Force to ensure that people infected with the Ebola virus are quarantined. The Holding Center, when completed, will be the first in the county since the Task Force was constituted months ago to coordinate all Ebola-related cases in the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1171 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Ebola tragedy is no good news, it has however proven to be Liberia's Golden Age in international goodwill and compassion to the nation and its people. Those having the skills and patience to log every bit of assistance from foreign powers during this critical health emergency would at the end of the day be coming out with an unprecedented height of aid inflow ever recorded in the history of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But should the material and human intervention by foreign friends take Liberians at the back row of the fight against the deadly disease? One of Liberia's legal luminaries and statesman, Charles Walker Brumskine, says a &quot;Big No&quot;. In a statement released to the media and in an interview with this paper, Cllr. Brumskine called on Liberians not to leave the anti-Ebola fight with foreign goodwill, but must remain consistently involved until final victory is won. The Analyst reports</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is heading international humanitarian response in the fight against Ebola. The millions of dollar infusion in the fight, the US will be stationed over 3,000 troops, perhaps the highest number of military personnel by that country on Liberian or African soil for whatever reason. The US and other international groups colossal aid for Liberia is expected to upset the crippling challenges Liberia has been facing, leading the country's comparatively high number of fatalities to the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty Party's political leader Charles W. Brumskine asserts that only could Liberians have done many things over the past several months that might have contained the virus or at least minimized the scale of infection, &quot;we are still struggling to mount an effective, coordinated plan that enjoys the confidence of the public&quot; even as US and other partners commence their beefed-up intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully the US intervention will help solve some of these problems, said Cllr. Brumskine who noted, however, that, &quot;it is important for us to keep in mind that Liberians will be required to do the real leg work that this crisis demands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Brumskine opined that Liberians must bring to bear the local knowledge and experience that only &quot;we can deliver to inform the work of our US and other foreign partners&quot; in order to facilitate the realization of this imperative that by making the observations and recommendations to the foreign partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major challenges faced in the current national effort in the fight against the Ebola virus has been the lack of timely information, presented with clarity and by credible messengers. The lack of trust in the government, low level of confidence in the government's efforts, and sometimes outright confusion about what the government's plan is for combating the disease, have all contributed to the persistent denials of the existence of the Ebola virus in the country, its' devastating effect notwithstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the current national effort at educating the public about the realness of the Ebola virus and how it is contracted continues to be met with skepticism and stubborn push-back, the education strategy needs reevaluation and modification. While the content of the message must continue to focus on the reality of the virus, how to avoid infection, and what to do if one or one's relative is suspected of infection or dies from the virus, the government should reconsider the vehicle it uses to deliver that message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulty about the anti-Ebola message is that people must adopt a behavioral mode that can be considered &quot;un-Liberian&quot;: not to do that which is a social and, for most, a moral obligation--to demonstrate love by caring for sick relatives and friends; not to shake hands, hug, pat backs, and the likes. The anti-Ebola message must, therefore, be conveyed with a sense of understanding and a degree of compassion, so that the hearer is willing to listen and comply instead of being offended and alienated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumskine agrees that the beefed up United States intervention should greatly assist in the fight against the Ebola virus, given the US military's unique expertise in engineering, and command and control should be especially useful in dealing with many of the infrastructural and logistical challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that &quot;We must, however, understand that the intervention is not intended to be, and will not be a panacea for dealing with the Ebola crisis; it most certainly will not rebuild our health care system. This is something that Liberia will have to do for itself. So, whether it is controlling the epidemic or mitigating the adverse economic, social, or political impacts on our nation, we must remain cognizant of our national responsibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the fight against the Ebola virus is a national effort, and the government must spare no effort to have all hands on deck. &quot;We can all learn from the collaboration of Liberians in the Diaspora under the banner 'We Stand as One,' which has demonstrated that Liberians will work together when our national interest is at stake,&quot; the Liberian legal expert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further noted: &quot;As we welcome the intervention of the United States of America to help deal with the national health catastrophe, occasioned by the Ebola outbreak, let us not forget that the responsibility of containing the outbreak and eventually eradicating the Ebola virus from Liberia remains ours, as a Government, a nation, and a people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumskine thanked President Obama and the American people for their interest in, and support to the Liberian people during Liberia's tragedy. He added: &quot;We are also thankful for the assistance of the United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, the African Union and all of our fellow African nations, the governments and people of the People's Republic of China, and Japan, Samaritan's Purse, and Doctors Without Borders, as well as other donors who are generously donating to this fight for our national survival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the Liberian statesman has lauded the courage of a Liberian woman, Fatu Kerkula, who reportedly used unconventional techniques to cure her family of Ebola. In an interview with The Analyst, Cllr. Brumskine described the woman as a national heroine that must be hailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNN reported that recently that Fatu had single-handedly saved the lives of members of her family, who were infected by the Ebola virus, by caring for them using non-professional personal protective equipment (PPE), such as plastic bags, trash bags, and whatever covering she could find to protect herself while providing home care for her relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr Brumskine says other Liberians should emulate the courage of Fatu in the fight against Ebola. He also welcomed the news that the World Bank has contributed US$52m, which will be channeled through and managed by the relevant UN Agencies for the fight against Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also want to thank President Sirleaf for finally allowing those who have the expertise and capacity to assist Liberia in dealing with our national health catastrophe,&quot; Brumskine said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Act Alliance- Liberia on Friday, September 26, 2014 dedicated a newly constructed Ebola case management center at the Phebe hospital through the government of Liberia. Act Alliance is an association of Churches that have been working together for more than twenty years providing services to mankind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his overview of the project at the dedication ceremony, the Executive director of the Lutheran development service Joseph Binda said, the facility is part of the rapid response fund project currently being implemented by Act Alliance- Liberia. Mr. Binda disclosed that decision to construct the facility was the result of an appeal to an Act Alliance delegation during a brief visit to the Phebe Hospital in June by the hospital's board Chairman Mr. Tornolah Varpilah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, during the delegation's discussions with members of the board, Mr. Varpilah underscored the need for assistance for the construction of an Isolation unit to enhance the fight against the virus. The LDS Executive director said they were satisfied with the project and will continue to work with the hospital in whatever way possible to improve health care delivery in Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Bong County health officer Dr. Sampson Arzuakoi who spoke on behalf of the ministry of health, commended Act Alliance- Liberia for the project and described it as a boost to the fight against Ebola. Dr. Arzuakoi said, the facility will now ease some of the challenges facing the county health team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking, Phebe hospital board Chairman Tornolah Varpilah said he was grateful to Act Alliance- Liberia for honoring his request. Funding for the seven room facility was provided by Act Alliance- Geneva. The total cost for the project is estimated at US$ 40,000 thousand US dollars. Meanwhile Nurses and doctors at the Phebe Hospital have described the facility as a sign of relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled; health workers at the facility back off from work for two months upon the outbreak of the Ebola virus demanding government to establishment isolation unit for suspected Ebola patients, provide Personal Protective Equipment and risk benefits amongst others. However the hospital later reopening to the public on September after the completion of the Ebola Treatment Unit in Suakoko District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hospital Chief Medical officer Jefferson Sabley told our Bong County Correspondent risk allowances for the nurses at the health center are stay being discussed by the board and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. He explained that some government provided some PPEs to hospital for the nurses return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">571 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MASSIVE FLOW of foreign support expressed in financial and human contribution to the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus is exceeding remarkable and must be lauded by all well-meaning Liberians. The United States Government, perhaps for the first time in its diplomatic relations with Liberia, is putting up to 3000 boots on the soil; something badly expected but wasn't in fact the case even during the 16 year conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ZAIRE-ORIGINATED virus has completely conquered the capacity of Liberia that the President of Liberia slightly sidestepped the much-sung sovereignty chorus and pleaded, almost in the form of utter prostration, with the United States to intervene. &quot;I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us,&quot; President Sirleaf told President Sirleaf in a letter dated September 9, 2014. &quot;Mr. President at the current rate of infections, only governments like yours have the resources and assets to deploy at the pace required to arrest the spread. Branches of your military and civilian institutions already have the expertise in dealing with biohazards, infectious diseases and chemical agents. They already understand appropriate infection control protocols and we saw these assets were deployed in Aceh after the tsunami and in Haiti after the earthquake. It is in appreciation of the difference in kind of disaster, that we are requesting assistance from units with expertise in managing biohazards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHETHER IT IS MADAM President's plea that triggered the massive inflow of US assistance or it was goodwill in the pipeline of America's usual compassion for mankind, the fact now is that Uncle Sam, Liberia's Number One traditional friend, others call it &quot;quasi colonizer&quot; is here in full on the ground and is leading an avalanche of international support. President Obama in his recent remarks at the UN General Assembly called on international organizations to move even faster, and mobilize partners on the ground as only they can. He asked nations to contribute critical assets and capabilities - whether it's air transport, medical evacuation, health care workers, equipment, or treatment. He urged that more foundations can tap into their networks of support, to raise funding and awareness to fight the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE US PRESIDENT'S PROMISE to lead a robust international coalition to fight Ebola in West Africa has become to bear fruit with the first batch of military personnel headed by Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, commander of the U.S. Army Africa, who arrived in Liberia last Tuesday. The United States is poised to build new Ebola treatment centers that may house up to 1,700 additional beds; create a new training facility to help prepare thousands more health care workers to handle sick patients. It is also being reported by that President Obama has called on Congress to approve additional funding his administration requested to carry on these critical efforts to stop the virus in addition to millions of dollars already committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS STRONG SIGNS of the Americans' support has begun to appear, and believing that the US-led international intervention presents a formidable remedy to Ebola, which has threatened the very existence of the Liberian state, we say hats off to all the partners, particularly the United States. We welcome them and wish them a safe and successful stay, and God bless them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola International has reaffirmed its commitment to further invest in Liberia as its contribution to postwar reconstruction terming its partnership as not just &quot;a fair weather&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the vice president and chief administrator for Coca Cola International, Alexander B. Cummings, at the head of a high-level delegation informed President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf that his company, having worked in Liberia for over 50 years, was pleased to announce an expansion of its production by adding pure water and canned juice components to its product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The expansion,&quot; Mr. Cummings disclosed, &quot;is drawn from the conducive investment climate and the long standing partnership between Coca-Cola and Liberia which will further provide additional job opportunities for the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new products, particularly Bonaqua mineral water, Mr. Cummings indicated, is expected to come online by March 2015 and that the equipment for its expansion will begin coming to the country next month (October). Mr. Cummings stressed that the production of the Bonaqua mineral water will eventually lead to the production of canned juices in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Ebola fight, the Coca-Cola Company donated several assorted items to the National Task Force on Ebola and promised to continue its assistance until a total eradication is reported. Items donated included a 40-foot container of medical supplies, 50,000 cases of Bonaqua mineral water, 30 infrared thermometers to twenty hospitals, and 300 hand washing kits to communities surrounding its production site in Paynesville, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coca-Cola vice president, who is a Liberian, extended best wishes on behalf of its chief executive officer Muhtar Kent to President Sirleaf as she fights Ebola and expressed deepest sadness as he watches and listens to news on how Ebola is claiming the lives of thousands in the sub-region including Liberia. Mr. Cummings quoted Mr. Kent as saying that he has committed his company to closely working with President Sirleaf and her Mano River Union counterparts to fight the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, President Sirleaf said Liberia was pleased by the announcement of the expansion as it demonstrates confidence in the Liberia's investment climate. She assured the delegation of government's openness to seeing more investment in Liberia expressing optimism that direct foreign investment turns to job creation and infrastructure development.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Inspector General Clarence Massaquoi says only concerted efforts on the part of all Liberians will lead to the eradication of the deadly Ebola virus from the country. The Liberian Police Chief said the issue of secrecy on the part of those contacting the virus was greatly responsible for its rapid spread, but insists that the only way Liberians can defeat the virus is when victims tell someone their story for prompt action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Massaquoi said the outbreak of the virus was seriously affecting the country in all aspects, but was quick to note that with the various moves put into place by the Liberian Government and its international partners the defeat of the virus was certain. The LNP Boss spoke Friday when he led a team of top LNP officials to re-open the Police Barracks, which was quarantined as the result of an outbreak of the Ebola virus there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Massaquoi said he was delighted that after nearly a month of quarantine no new case of the virus was noticed among officers and their families living in the barracks, stressing that early step to prevent the virus was responsible for the success story in the barracks. He admonished occupants of the Police barracks to continue practicing the safety measures and help spread the anti-Ebola message to their friends and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He extended gratitude to the Government of Liberia, the National Task Force on Ebola, the Kailondo Group of Companies, Mrs. Mai Urey, Dr. Emmanuel Dolo, Putu Iron Ore Mining Company and other institutions and individuals who provided assistance to the Police while the barracks was being quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the quarantine lifting ceremony at the barracks, the Chief Executive Office of the Kailondo Group of Companies George Kailondo and Madam Mai Urey said they were grateful to identify with the Police in their distress and called on all Liberians to join the fight against the Ebola virus. The prominent Liberians said they will continue to play an active role in the national fight against the spread of the virus until the country is totally free of Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on Thursday, September 25, joined world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to participate in a High-Level Meeting on Response to the Ebola virus outbreak in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, held under the leadership of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, also had in attendance United States President, Barrack Obama, World Health Organization Director-General, Dr. Margaret Chan, World Bank President, Dr. Jim Kim, African Union Commission Chairperson, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma, Guinean President, Dr. Alpha Conde, Sierra Leonean President Ernest Bai Koroma, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Liberian leader, via a video link from the Monrovia office of the African Development Bank (AfDB), informed world leaders that Liberia today is faced with the greatest challenge because it cannot allow the projection of a worst case scenario that over 100,000 innocent citizens will die from an invisible disease they did not start and do not understand. She stressed that the resulting effect of this epidemic will reverse the gains in malaria, child and maternal mortality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said the deadly Ebola virus has so far taken the lives of over 1,700 persons including 85 of those trained to save lives. She indicated that as a consequence of the disease, livelihoods are being threatened; there has become a precipitous decline in economic activities, loss of income and jobs, health services have deteriorated, prices of basic commodities have increased and there is limitation in free movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Partners and friends, based on understandable fear, have ostracized us; shipping and airline services have sanctioned us; and the world has taken some time to fully appreciate and adequately respond to the enormity of our tragedy,&quot; President Sirleaf emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the High-Level Meeting that Liberia is fighting with the support of many of its partners; adding that the country is intensifying its response, building and staffing more treatment centers across the country and moving more aggressively to prevent the transmission and change in behavior through community outreach and ownership programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said Liberians have proudly developed a resilient spirit of overcoming great tragedies and with the help of its partners is poised to do so once again. &quot;We thank many of you around this table who have joined in the fight; partners who through robust response have given us renewed trust in the value of partnership; partners who have given us renewed hope in a bright future for our children,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the world that not long ago Liberia was the epicenter of a regional war by which it experienced the total economic collapse and massive destruction of infrastructure and institutions, adding that the country has faced many challenges in its historical journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In separate statements earlier, U.S. President Barrack Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, World Bank President Jim Kim and AU Commission Chairperson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said the world needs to act and act very quickly to address the Ebola epidemic plaguing the West African sub-region.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT ELLEN JOHNSON Sirleaf, on Thursday, September 25, joined world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to participate in a High-Level Meeting on Response to the Ebola virus outbreak in the sub-region. The Liberian leader who joined the High Level Meeting, via a video link from the Monrovia office of the African Development Bank (AfDB), informed world leaders that Liberia today is faced with the greatest challenge because it cannot allow the projection of a worst case scenario that over 100,000 innocent citizens will die from an invisible disease they did not start and do not understand. She stressed that the resulting effect of this epidemic will reverse the gains in malaria, child and maternal mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MEETING, HELD under the leadership of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, also had in attendance the United States President Barrack Obama, World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan, World Bank President, Dr. Jim Kim, African Union Commission Chairperson, Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma, Guinean President, Dr. Alpha Conde, Sierra Leonean President, Ernest Bai Koroma, among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT SIRLEAF SAID the deadly Ebola virus disease has so far taken the lives of over 1,700 persons including 85 of those trained to save lives. She indicated that as a consequence of the disease, livelihoods are being threatened and there has become a precipitous decline in economic activities, loss of income and jobs, health services have deteriorated, prices of basic commodities have increased and there is limitation in free movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PARTNERS AND FRIENDS, based on understandable fear, have ostracized us; shipping and airline services have sanctioned us; and the world has taken some time to fully appreciate and adequately respond to the enormity of our tragedy,&quot; President Sirleaf emphasized. She told the High-Level Meeting that Liberia is fighting with the support of many of its partners; adding that the country is intensifying its response, building and staffing more treatment centers across the country and moving more aggressively to prevent the transmission and change in behavior through community outreach and ownership programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT SIRLEAF SAID Liberians have proudly developed a resilient spirit of overcoming great tragedies and with the help of its partners is poised to do so once again. &quot;We thank many of you around this table who have joined in the fight; partners who through robust response have given us renewed trust in the value of partnership; partners who have given us renewed hope in a bright future for our children,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHE TOLD THE world that not long ago Liberia was the epicenter of a regional war by which it experienced the total economic collapse and massive destruction of infrastructure and institutions, adding that the country has faced many challenges in its historical journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN SEPARATE STATEMENTS earlier, U.S. President Barrack Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, WHO Director-General MargaretChan, World Bank President Jim Kim and AU Commission Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said the world needs to act and act very quickly to address the Ebola epidemic plaguing the West African sub-region. They indicated that the world has not done enough to contain the further spread of the virus and urged countries and international organizations to remove red tapes in their processes to respond quickly and urgently to the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE WELCOME THE advocacy proffered by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf at the World body relative to Liberia's fight against the Ebola virus. We also appreciate the good sentiments expressed and moves taken by world leaders on the fight against the virus. What we desire more now is to act quickly and save mankind from further elimination because it is an open secret that Ebola wastes no time in destroying families, communities and people at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS IN this vein that we are calling on the world to continue doing what they are doing by speeding up Global approach needed to fight Ebola and help the affected countries survive the disease. Even after this disease shall have been history, we will still need the financial, moral and social support of the World to fully recover from the loss we have encountered. Indeed we need a continuous global approach which will speed up the promises and pledges coming in to help fight this menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE SAME time, we must have a change of attitude, behavior and help ourselves while others are reaching out to help us conquer the EVD. We must observe all measures being put in place by the Ministry of Health and our partners to defeat the virus while it is time to stop doubting and do things that are of reality if Ebola must indeed go away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lincoln described the gesture as their little contribution to the Ebola response, and called on Liberians and partners to unite efforts in burning Ebola out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, Lutheran Bishop, Dr. D. Jessen Seyenkulo said this was just the start of many good things to happen and that the Church and Partners will continue to contribute in the fight and eradication of the Ebola virus and ensure a healthy society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty Philip N. Wesseh (pnw)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1505 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become a tradition by organizations and groups to always hold special events to mark the day on which such organizations or groups came into being. The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) is not an exception to this tradition as it usually and annually organizes special events to remember the day on which this organization came into existence. Over the years, it had held elaborate events, including intercessory services, parades and indoor programs. However because of the deadly elaborate virus, the union would depart from its usual celebration characterized by pomp and pageantry, as well as conviviality by joining the campaign of awareness to curtail the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to historical facts, &quot;in 1964, a group of journalists founded the Press Union of Liberia. The Union was founded following the detention of a colleague, Stanton B. Peabody. Bob Stan as he was affectionately called was imprisoned by the then &quot;power that be&quot; for referring to members of the Legislature as &quot;radicals&quot;. Not only did the detention of Journalist Peabody surprise them, it also showed how helpless they were and needed a cohesive protective instrument to challenge their cause.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is said that two days after the release, Mr. Peabody was taken directly to the office of then Director of Information at the Information Ministry where a group of journalists had already converged. Among those journalists present at the gathering were Director E. Reginald Townsend, Henry B. Cole, Chuncey Cooper, Aston King, Tuan Wreh, J. Persey Gumel. The journalists, at once, decided to form a journalist association that would guide, defend, protect and advocate the rights of its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the challenges faced by them at the time, like the formation and naming of any organization was the name for the group. During their brainstorming session, one journalist proposed the acronym JAIL, the Journalist Association in Liberia. However, that was rejected because of the acronym. However, following extensive debates and brainstorming, they derived at the name -- Press Union of Liberia, a name that has stood the test of time, in a country that has been faced with many problems, including civil strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its official statement on this year's celebration which is tomorrow, the PUL leadership said , &quot;as part of activities marking the 50th Aniversary celebration of the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) on September 30, 2014, all individual and institutional members are encouraged to fully participate including making contributions to ensure the success of the planned activities. The PUL has dedicated its Golden Jubilee to the national war against the Ebola virus disease which has so far claimed over 1,500 lives in the country. On September 30, 2014, PUL members will go into five selected communities with donations, awareness and messages of hope as a way of solidifying its stance against the virus. To achieve this, individual members are therefore required to contribute US$10 for a T-shirt while institutional members are encouraged to contribute at least US$100. Besides, all broadcast media houses are encouraged to relay the live programs which schedules are being finalized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is said that the celebration or observance of an anniversary in intended to reflect on the past. That is, for one or a group to take soberly and reflect on the past, take stock and then determine the way forward for the future. As for the Union which grew out of a crisis, it continues to play its rightful role in the Liberian society. It continues to advocate for press freedom and has been part of activities to ensure the tenets of good governance. Besides, it has taken actions against some of its members and institutions for ethical transgressions. Today, the Union remains a strong member of the civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one area that continues to cast an aspersion on the union is the status of the US$100,000 contribution given the union during the administration of Mr. George Barpeen by President Sirleaf to help with the Union's headquarters project that is still in limbo in the Sinkor area. I am aware that whenever the issue of the US$100,000 is raised in the public, some individuals, especially those who were in power always feel that fingers are being pointed at them, or that they are being accused of financial malpractice. NO, this is not the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, it is unfortunate because this is something that concerns all of us as members of that Union. It is not about accusing anyone or any former official of engaging in any skullduggery. It would be sheer naivety to accuse anyone of wrongdoing without incontrovertible evidence. Indisputably, the fact remains that because nothing visible has been seen regarding the reasons for the donation, this continues to embarrass the Union. For this, it has now put a stigma on the Union, as it continues to demand for transparency and accountability in the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, I was part of the delegation that met President Sirleaf when the check for the amount was presented to the Union. And so, I cannot exclude myself of not being a part. But what I am not aware of is the decision on the utilization of the money. If no one is embarrassed about the status of this money, I am very embarrassed because I am also faced with this question of the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the pre-war members of the Union members of the Union and one of those who witnessed the presentation of the check, there is no way I will sit without seeing this being resolved. By being a member of the Union, through the encouragement of my mentor, Kenneth Y. Best, of the Daily Observer, it afforded me the opportunity to interact with senior journalists to the civil conflict. They included the late Bill Frank, Olivia Shannon, the late John Scotland; Prof Alhaji Kromah, Lamini Waritay, both of whom later taught me at the University of Liberia; the late T-max Teah, the late Klon Hinneh and the late Rufus M. Darpoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question that continues to linger on is all about this US$100,000.This may be owing to the position or stance that we as officials and members of the Union took on the donation. Howbeit, as we celebrate quietly this five decades of existence in a country in which the press has struggled for years to relatively be free today, it is necessary that we reflect on this serious matter as it continues to bring us into public repute, not necessarily about &quot;eating the money,&quot;as there is no evidence to make such claim, but because nothing has been seen, for which the money was given, this is why there is concern about this donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I conclude this piece, I am happy about what I am hearing that the Abdullah Kamara administration is making frantic efforts to get to the bottom of this, to avoid the continued shame on the Union. I am told that had it not been for this Ebola pestilence, much could have been achieved. With this, let me encourage this administration to do everything in its power to save the Union from disgrace and embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, this piece should not be seen as trying to bring anyone to public disgrace or repute, as all of us, as members are part of the problem, either by commission or omission. This piece is only intended to keep out feet to the fire to resolve this US$100,000 issue. Whether the problem came from the administration that received the money or the administration that succeeded it, this is no time to apportion blame, but to find a way out of this quagmire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we observe the 50 years of existence, a partially finished headquarters could had been a big gift. But it is not too late, as to err is human. Hence the challenge now is for this administration that has started the process to save the Union from disgrace and stigmatization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just yesterday, when our photographer Kennedy Zobah went to take a photo of the land on which the headquarters' project should have been built in Sinkor, a lady who asked to speak to me expressed concern of the status of the money given by the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her colloquial words she said angrily, &quot;Everyday your writing about corruption, you people are also corrupt because nothing you people have done with the money the President gave your. I will put you photo on the Facebook too.&quot; The way this lady now perceives the media because of this money is how many other persons feel. Therefore, we MUST Act!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally on this day, let me say that it is sad to note that at this time of efforts to curtail the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, the national broadcaster, the Liberia Broadcast System (LBS) is off the air because of the lack of fuel to operate it. Indeed, this is embarrassing and MUST immediately claim the attention of the Liberian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government cannot remain insensitive to the plight of this station that has been incredibly doing well in the face of limited financial resources. If support to the station has not been taken seriously, this trend should be reserved at this time of this WAR against Ebola, as communication is vital in the fight against this disease.I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">540 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Oil Company of Liberia has stepped up its support towards efforts to contain the spread of the Ebola virus in Liberia. The company has now contributed more than a quarter of a million dollars in cash and essential health materials since the outbreak of the virus in Liberia more than six months ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Engagement Manager of NOCAL, Mr. Jonathan Sogbie, made the disclosure when the company presented a consignment of assorted food items and clothing to the Ebola Treatment Unit-2 at ELWA and residents of district #6 affected by Ebola. The company also presented similar items to the John F. Kennedy Memorial hospital's Ebola Treatment Unit. The NOCAL official said the latest contributions are part of the company's efforts to identify with Liberians during the public health emergency the country is experiencing. &quot;We all need to join the government in eradicating this disease from Liberia,&quot; he urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Board of Directors, Management and Staff of NOCAL, Mr. Sogbie praised the personal sacrifices health personnel continue to make in helping to save lives. He admonished all Liberians and others residing within the country to adhere to health tips issued by the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare to help contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sogbie gave the assurance that NOCAL will continue to support government's efforts aimed at containing the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the ELWA treatment Unit, Dr. Jerry Brown, welcomed the donation by NOCAL and appealed for more medication to help treat patients. He admonished Liberians to continue to support and respect health workers as they perform their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Brown said the fight against Ebola will only succeed if Liberians follow health safety measures and demonstrate appreciation towards health workers. He recalled an incident when a doctor working at the Emergency Treatment Unit was evicted from his residence by a landlord for fear that the doctor may infect other tenants. Such behavior, Dr. Brown, cautioned, does not help the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montserrado County Representative, Edwin M. Snowe, also commended NOCAL for supporting efforts of the District Task Force in caring for residents quarantined in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest presentation by NOCAL brings the oil company's total contribution towards the Ebola fight to US $291,500.00 (two-hundred ninety-one thousand five hundred dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, NOCAL presented a check for US $150,000.00 (one-hundred &amp; fifty-thousand dollars) towards the Ebola Trust Fund. The company recently presented Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare, worth over US $84,000.00 (eighty-four thousand dollars). NOCAL also contributed US $27,500.00 (twenty-seven thousand five-hundred dollars) to help airlift a consignment of essential medical supplies being brought into the country by Chevron-Liberia, Ltd., and its international partner, International Medical Equipment Collaborative (IMEC). The National Task Force has since taken delivery of the items worth more than US $240,000.00 (two hundred forty-thousand-dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, NOCAL presented several materials to a local Non-Governmental Organization, 'Feed the Future', in its effort to tackle the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">791 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As international efforts intensify, with calls from world leaders to galvanize support to sustain the anti-Ebola war, which has already claimed nearly 3,000 lives in the West African Region, Global Coca-Cola's Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Mr. Alexander B. Cummings, Jr. over the weekend led a high power delegation to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone on a solidarity visit. Addressing journalists at the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC) in Paynesville shortly upon arrival from the Roberts International Airport (RIA), Mr. Cummings who led the 7-man delegation disclosed that the team was in the country to demonstrate solidarity and support for Liberia. &quot;We are here to show solidarity and support to Liberia and our employees. You can know your friends in times of trouble. These times, are being challenging times for Liberia and our employees. So, our visit here is to show our support and solidarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cummings declared that the Company would continue to stand by Liberia despite the Ebola crisis by increasing investment to boost the country's economy, although he acknowledged the impact of the Ebola situation on the operation of the Coca-Cola Company since its outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Coca-Cola Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, Mr. Cummings, was very optimistic and consoled Liberians that the country would prevail in the anti-Ebola war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Cummings revealed that the company was in readiness to increase its operation in Liberia by investing over US$4 million to open another line of plant which according to him, would produce soft drinks and mineral water in plastic, amongst others, something according to him, would help to create more jobs for Liberians and boost the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also met with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf at her Foreign Ministry office before departing Liberia for Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the virulent Ebola virus, the Coca-Cola Family has made and continues to make tremendous contributions in an effort to defeat the deadly virus and save lives. As initial efforts towards the fight, the Company through its Liberia branch, the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC), amongst other things provided cash, water and anti-Ebola sanitizing materials, as part of effort to eradicate the killer disease and help those who have already contracted the virus and undergoing treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Company initially distributed 22,800 bottles of mineral water in some affected communities and health centers, including ELWA and JFK hospitals, Dolo Town, Margibi County, West Point, Montserrado County and Foya, Lofa County, valued at US$10, 450.00</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the company has provided 25 pieces of thermometers to few health centers and hospitals, including S.D Cooper Clinic, Benson Hospital, James Davis, Redemption, SOS and Dr. Swaray medical center in Paynesville, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others items distributed by the LCCBC include, 450 giant-size containers and buckets to help in the fight against the alarming deadly plague which has kept the nation in perpetual terror since its outbreak few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has also deposited US$2,000.00 cash into the anti-Ebola Trust Fund at the Central Bank of Liberia, the total amount spent in the entire process is put at over US$13,500.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In continuation of such effort, the Coca-Cola Company in Liberia, together with its bottling partner, Equatorial Coca-Cola Bottling Company (ECCBC), on Tuesday, September 16, 2014, presented additional medical supplies to the Ministry of Health in the amount of US$48,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplies, which were requested by local hospitals, according the Company, included personal protective equipment, such as latex gloves, gowns, face shields, face masks and shoe covers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation to the National Taskforce on Ebola, the Human Resource Manager of the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC), Atty. Gabriel A. Johnson said, &quot;the immediate delivery of these supplies is critical in protecting the health workers who can help to slow the spread of this disease but this is just the first shipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Johnson added that, following the first air-shipment, the LCCBC and its partner, ECCBC had ordered two more forty-foot containers of medical supplies. &quot;The Coca-Cola Company has provided $200,000 through its Africa Foundation to procure medical equipment and supplies to support the efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria&quot;, he disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 4 years, The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has donated over $2million worth of medical equipment to countries across Africa, including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, Gambia and many others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Medical Officer of Liberia Dr. Bernice Dahn has put herself under quarantine for 21 days after one of her assistants died from the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Dahn is also Deputy Minister of Health and Social Welfare, and according to reports, she has no symptoms but wanted to take precautionary measure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) says more than 3,000 people have died from Ebola in West Africa, and accordingly, Liberia has been the worst hit by the disease, accounting for 1,830 deaths - 150 in the last two days alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers have been particularly vulnerable to the virus which is spread by the infected bodily fluids of patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health organizations recommend isolating people for at least 21 days, maximum incubation period for the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Medical Officer told the BBC on Saturday that she decided to go into quarantine and also to abide by that rule. She explained that she had not come in contact with any other infected people, apart from the office assistant who died last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Dahn, who represented Liberia at international Ebola conferences, has also instructed her staff to stay at home for the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO highlighted the risk of infection for health workers trying to stem the outbreak in its latest report released on Friday,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said 375 workers are known to have been infected, and that 211 have so far died from the virus in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths and sickness have made it even more difficult for the already weak healthcare systems in the affected countries to cope with the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest WHO figures indicate that more than 6,500 people are believed to have been infected in the region in the world's most deadly Ebola outbreak. On last Friday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pledged to send US$130 million in emergency aid to the countries worst hit by the virus: Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 600 people have died in Sierra Leone and a similar number in Guinea, where the outbreak was first confirmed in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal, which has also been affected by the virus, is due to receive a flight carrying aid workers from one of the three worst affected countries, Guinea, for the first time on Saturday, AP news agency reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airport in Dakar has set up a terminal specifically for humanitarian flights where thorough health checks will be conducted, the agency quotes World Food Program spokesman Alexis Masciarelli as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week, President Barack Obama called for more urgent action in response to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the absence of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf at the UN General Assembly in New York where she was expected to present the state of the Ebola crisis and other issues affecting the country to the world body, diaspora Liberians went ahead with their planned protest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were adamant as they gathered on the grounds of the United Nations headquarters calling for the President to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Johnson-Sirleaf did not attend this year's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the government has not given any reason for the President's absence where she was expected to have properly elucidated the state of the Ebola crisis to the world body, notwithstanding, Foreign Minister Augustine K. Ngafuan spoke on behalf of the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of that, Liberians based in the United States, Europe and other parts converged at the U.N. headquarters in New York, where a peaceful protest against Madam Sirleaf was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports say the protesters chanted anti-Johnson-Sirleaf slogans carrying placards with various inscriptions, one of which read: &quot;Time Out! Step Down Madam Sirleaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers of the protest said the action was staged due to her failure to address several governance issues. They claimed that the President has failed to deal with corruption as promised in her inaugural speech in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They indicated that the protest rally was held as planned against failed leadership resulting in widespread Ebola virus in Liberia. They also cited gross impunity and rampant corruption in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, President Sirleaf's long time buddy, Tarloh Quiwonkpa, called on her to step down because she had failed to live up to the oath of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She claimed that the Liberian leader had paid lip-service to the fight against graft, noting that despite the establishment of several anti-graft institutions in the country, corruption remains extremely high in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tarloh recalled when President Sirleaf took office in 2006, she declared corruption as Public Enemy Number One. However, she said the Liberian leader has failed to deal with corruption as promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2013 Global Corruption Barometer ranked Liberia 'number one' in the world. The country is also ranked amongst the world's poorest with most of her citizens living on one US Dollar a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tarloh Quiwonkpa is the wife of slain former commanding general Thomas Quiwonkpa who was killed in the November 12, 1985 abortive invasion. Gen. Quiwonkpa who led the invasion was captured and killed by forces loyal to former military dictator Samuel K. Doe. Madam Quiwonkpa had often linked President Sirleaf to the abortive invasion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Program for Christians-Muslims Relations in Africa (PROCMURA) Liberia Area Committee over the weekend identified with Ebola survivors and several communities in Virginia, Montserrado County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group donated several bags of rice, buckets, Argo oil, clorax and soaps to Ebola survivors in Pianyonkosa and residents of Hotel Africa and Banjor Beach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the items on behalf of PROCMURA-Liberia, the Secretary General of Liberia Council of Churches (LCC) James Y. Gayflor said the donation was his organization's way of identifying with them during this national health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said as an institution that cares for the wellbeing of the people, PROCMURA decided to identify with communities that are hit by the Ebola virus so as to assure the residents that they are not alone in their time of calamity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gayflor assured the Ebola survivors and residents of PROCMURA's assistance in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the district representative of the area Rep. William Dakel lauded PROCMURA for the donation noting that since the outbreak of the Ebola virus, over 30 persons have died from the Pianyonkosa Refugee Camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Dakel said PROCMURA is the only institution that has identified with residents of the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the items would help to put smiles on the faces of the Ebola survivors and residents who do not have any means of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola survivors hailed PROCMURA-Liberia Area Committee for the donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Dr. Benjamin D. Lartey said PROCMURA is a Pan African Christian organization dedicated to Christians' constructive engagement with Muslims in witness, mutual tolerance and collaboration towards peace and peaceful co-existence for the holistic development to human family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the group is the only organization in Africa that stretches hands of friendship to the Muslims community with a vision of a continent where religious communities can live with their differences in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Lartey said the group would extend its humanitarian assistance to other counties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Joint Force Command of the Operation United Assistance has broken grounds in Margibi County for the construction of a 25 bed hospital for healthcare workers who are helping to save the lives of Ebola patients.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital, which will be constructed shortly specifically for treatment and special care for healthcare workers who may come in contact with the Ebola virus while treating sick people in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking over the weekend during the ground breaking ceremony in Margibi County, the Spokesperson of the Joint Force Command of the Operation United Assistance Major Jason Brown said the hospital construction is in line with the United States Government's effort to help the government and people of Liberia respond to the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Brown said the Joint Force Command of the Operation United Assistance hopes that the hospital would be built as soon as possible to ensure that healthcare workers are catered for in time of need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital, according to Major Brown, will be fully equipped with modern equipment to ensure that health workers are in the better position to care for sick people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here at the invitation of the Government of Liberia and so everything is by and through the Government's offices and so the guys are excited to be here to provide humanitarian services to Liberia,&quot; Major Brown indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the coming of the Operation United Assistance to help in the Ebola situation demonstrates the long ties that have existed between the governments of United States of America and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the United States Government designed a number of strategies aimed at helping Liberia and other West African countries affected by the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among some of the strategies designed by the U.S. Government is construction of hospital for healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the United States Government said it has applied a whole-of-government response to the epidemic, which was launched shortly after the first cases were reported in March with more than $175 million spent on the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama also disclosed the setting up of a Joint Force Command headquarter in Monrovia, Liberia, to provide regional command and control support to U.S. military activities and facilitate coordination with U.S. government and international relief efforts, which will involve an estimated 3,000 U.S. forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama further said the command engineers will build additional Ebola Treatment Units in affected areas. He said the U.S. Government will help recruit and organize medical personnel to staff them as well as establishing a site to train up to 500 health care providers per week, enabling healthcare workers to safely provide direct medical care to patients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As international efforts intensify, with calls from world leaders to galvanize support to contain the Ebola virus, which has already claimed nearly 3,000 lives in the West African Region, Global Coca-Cola's Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Mr. Alexander B. Cummings, Jr. over the weekend led a high power delegation to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone on a solidarity visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing journalists Friday at the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC) in Paynesville shortly upon arrival from the Roberts International Airport (RIA), Mr. Cummings who led the 7-man delegation disclosed that the team was in the country to demonstrate solidarity and support for Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to show solidarity and support to Liberia and our employees. You can know your friends in times of trouble. These times are challenging times for Liberia and our employees. So, our visit here is to show our support and solidarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cummings declared that the Company would continue to stand by Liberia despite the Ebola crisis by increasing investment to boost the country's economy, although he acknowledged the impact of the Ebola situation on the operation of the Coca-Cola Company since its outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Coca-Cola Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer was very optimistic and consoled Liberians that the country would prevail in the anti-Ebola war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Cummings revealed that the company is ready to increase its operation in Liberia by investing over US$4 million to open another line of plant which according to him would produce canned soft drinks and mineral water in plastic, amongst others, something according to him would help to create more jobs for Liberians and boost the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also met with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf at her Foreign Ministry office before departing for Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the virulent Ebola virus, the Coca-Cola Family has made and continues to make tremendous contributions in an effort to defeat the deadly virus and save lives. As initial efforts towards the fight, the Company through its Liberia branch, the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC), amongst other things provided cash, water and anti-Ebola sanitizing materials as part of efforts to eradicate the killer disease and help those who have already contracted the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Company initially distributed 22,800 bottles of mineral water in some affected communities and health centers including ELWA and JFK hospitals, Dolo Town, Margibi County, West Point, Montserrado County and Foya, Lofa County valued at US$10, 450.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the company has provided 25 pieces of thermometers to few health centers and hospitals, including S.D Cooper Clinic, Benson Hospital, James Davis, Redemption, SOS and Dr. Swaray medical center in Paynesville, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others items distributed by the LCCBC include, 450 giant-size containers and buckets to help in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has also deposited US$2,000.00 cash into the anti-Ebola Trust Fund at the Central Bank of Liberia. The total amount spent by the company in the entire process is put at over US$13,500.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Coca-Cola Company has provided $200,000 through its Africa Foundation to procure medical equipment and supplies to support efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria&quot;, he disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past 4 years, Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has donated over $2million worth of medical equipment to countries across Africa, including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, Gambia and many others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">857 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration and staff of the Phebe Hospital in Bong County now have all reasons to smile and continue providing professional medical services in the wake of the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital is amongst several medical institutions in the country that was hard hit as a result of the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, leaving some of its nurses and other health workers dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital was closed and that the administration was requesting Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and an Ebola Case Management Center before reopening, while nurses and other health workers demanded risk benefits or incentives before returning to work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation led to the intervention of the Lutheran Church in Liberia, through the Action by Churches Together (Actalliance Liberia Forum) with the provision of two separate donations of medical items, including PPEs to Phebe Hospital in Bong County and Curran Lutheran Hospital in Lofa County respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses and Health workers at the Phebe Hospital were appealed to and begged to return to work while their demands were being looked into. Lutheran Bishop assured that all would be done in consultation with government and partners to address concerns of the nurses and other health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Phebe administration and staff agreed to return to work, with the re-opening of the Hospital two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to its promise, actalliance Liberia Forum with support from Geneva over the week visited the Phebe Hospital in Bong County and dedicated the newly constructed modern Ebola Case Management Center and made a huge donation including the settlement of the issue of Risk Benefits for nurses and other health workers, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the building is close to 40 thousand USD, while the medical materials including PPEs are valued at 9 thousand USD, bags of rice...1,500 USD, and Risk Benefits for nurses....26 thousand USD were donated to the Phebe hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen thousand United States dollars was also donated to the Curran Lutheran Hospital by actalliance Liberia Forum. Actalliance Liberia Forum comprises of Finn Church Aid, Lutheran Development Service, ECHO Corporation, Lutheran Church in Liberia and Church World Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving an overview of the Project at a well-attended turning-over ceremony over the weekend, the Executive Director of the Lutheran Development Service in Liberia (LDS) &quot;a member of actalliance that led to the successful implementation of the Project&quot; said the modern Ebola Case Management Center was constructed from &quot;Rapid Response Fund&quot; from actalliance in Geneva to address the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Joseph S. Binda expressed hope that the facility will be used in the fight against the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Binda said he was happy that the Project was implemented within a period of three months as agreed by actalliance Liberia Forum and the Head Office in Geneva, Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the Chairman of actalliance Liberia Forum, Allen Lincoln unveiled a package which includes Medical Drugs &amp; Supplies, and consignment of rice to Phebe, and the payment of incentives or Risk Benefits to both Phebe and Curran Hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lincoln described the gesture as their little contribution to the Ebola response, and called on Liberians and partners to unite efforts in burning Ebola out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, Lutheran Bishop Dr. D. Jessen Seyenkulo said this was just the start of many good things to happen and that the Church and Partners will continue to contribute in the fight and eradication of the Ebola virus and ensure a healthy society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Dr. Seyenkulo called for proper management and accountability to attract more goodwill contributions and donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the keys to the modern Ebola Case Management Center and donation, Phebe Hospital Medical Director Dr. Jefferson Sibley said he was the happiest man in the world because of so many reasons, including the modern and durable structure which would also be used after the Ebola epidemic is contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sibley commanded actalliance and assured that the Center and donation will be used for the intended reasons, in the supreme interest of the hospital, staff and patients in particular and the nation in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Health Officer representing the Liberian government and the Ministry of Health, Sampson Arzoaquoi also commended actalliance and called on other faith based organizations to emulate such good example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Arzoaquoi expressed joy for the Ebola Case Management Center and the donation and promised to continue working with Phebe Hospital and other health institutions in the fight against Ebola and other illnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Program was also attended by the Board Chairman of Phebe Hospital, S. Tornorlah Varpilah, a Representative of the World Health Organization Daniel Kibuga and a Representative of the Internal Affairs Ministry/County Superintendent. They also commended actalliance for the gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses and other health workers were seen jubilating and singing praises to God at the close of the program, describing as a new day, &quot;the Ebola Case Management Center, donation of medical drugs and materials, and the settlement of their Risk Benefits, among others&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank says it will commit an additional US$400m to help hardest-hit countries address emergency issues. Earlier, the Bank gave a grant of US$105 million to the three hardest hit West African countries - Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - to help in their response to the Ebola crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US$400 Million will mostly target, increasing health care workforce and purchasing needed supplies and equipment as well as the training of health care units' workers and to bolster care at the community level throughout the regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These funds are being used to pay for essential supplies and drugs, personal protective equipment and infection prevention, control materials, health worker training, hazard pay and death benefits to Ebola health workers and volunteers, contact tracing, vehicles, data management equipment and door-to-door public health education outreach&quot; a release issued at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the release, the World Bank indicated that US$170 million will be used in medium to long-term assistance for the countries' health teams, while US$230 million will be geared towards the emergency response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The real challenge now is to bring care and treatment to the most remote areas as well as the cities and then to build a stronger health care system,&quot; said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, who spoke at the United Nations on issues surrounding the Ebola Crisis in Africa, on Thursday, September 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a World Bank analysis has revealed that if the Ebola virus continues its deadly trends in the three most-affected countries the economic impact could lead to a disastrous blow on the citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study also found that with rapid national and international responses which could alleviate fear resulting from a person's concern about infection, the economic costs can be limited. &quot;This is a humanitarian catastrophe, first and foremost, but the economic ramifications are very broad and could be long lasting,&quot; Kim said.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Walker Brumskine</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1637 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the US Government's plan to assist West African nations in the fight against the Ebola virus, President Barack Obama said that, &quot;The Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the humanitarian crisis there is a top national security priority for the United States. In order to contain and combat it, we are partnering with the United Nations and other international partners to help the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Senegal respond just as we fortify our defenses at home. Every outbreak of Ebola over the past 40 years has been contained, and we are confident that this one can--and will be--as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States' strategy is reported as being predicated on four key goals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controlling the epidemic at its source in West Africa;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitigating second-order impacts, including blunting the economic, social, and political tolls in the region;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engaging and coordinating with a broader global audience; and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortifying global health security infrastructure in the region and beyond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We thank President Obama and the American people for their interest in, and support to the Liberian people during our national tragedy. We are also thankful for the assistance of United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union, the African Union and all of our fellow African nations, the governments and people of the People's Republic of China, and Japan, Samaritan's Purse, and Doctors Without Borders, as well as other donors who are generously donating to this fight for our national survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we welcome the intervention of the United States of America to help deal with the national health catastrophe, occasioned by the Ebola outbreak, let us not forget that the responsibility of containing the outbreak and eventually eradicating the Ebola virus from Liberia remains ours, as a Government, a nation, and a people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beefed up United States intervention should greatly assist in the fight against the Ebola virus, as the US military's unique expertise in engineering, and command and control should be especially useful in dealing with many of the infrastructural and logistical challenges. We must, however, understand that the intervention is not intended to be, and will not be a panacea for dealing with the Ebola crisis; it most certainly will not rebuild our healthcare system. This is something that Liberia will have to do for itself. So, whether it is controlling the epidemic or mitigating the adverse economic, social, or political impacts on our nation we must remain cognizant of our national responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experts have told us, in no uncertain terms, that Ebola is a public health problem, which, like any other public health issue, is more effectively dealt with through prevention rather than cure. So, as the Americans assist us in the short term, it remains our responsibility, as a nation, to deal with the real public health issue of prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only were there many things we could have done over the past several months that might have contained the virus or at least minimized the scale of infection, but even as our US partner commence sits beefed-up intervention, we are still struggling to mount an effective, coordinated plan that enjoys the confidence of the public. Hopefully the US intervention will help solve some of these problems, but it is important for us to keep in mind that Liberians will be required to do the real leg work that this crisis demands. We must bring to bear the local knowledge and experience that only we can deliver to inform the work of our US and other foreign partners. It is to facilitate the realization of this imperative that we make the observations and recommendations herein contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the major challenges faced in the current national effort in the fight against the Ebola virus has been the lack of timely information, presented with clarity and by credible messengers. The lack of trust in the government, low level of confidence in government's efforts, and sometimes outright confusion about what the government's plan is for combating the disease, have all contributed to the persistent denials of the existence of the Ebola virus in the country, its devastating effect notwithstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the current national effort at educating the public about the realness of the Ebola virus and how it is contracted continues to be met with skepticism and stubborn push-back, the education strategy needs reevaluation and modification. While the content of the message must continue to focus on the reality of the virus, how to avoid infection, and what to do if one or one's relative is suspected of infection or dies from the virus, the government should reconsider the vehicle it uses to deliver that message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulty about the anti-Ebola message is that people must adopt a behavioral mode that can be considered &quot;un-Liberian&quot;: not to do that which is a social and, for most, a moral obligation--to demonstrate love by caring for sick relatives and friends; not to shake hands, hug, pat backs, and the likes. The ant-Ebola message must, therefore, be conveyed with a sense of understanding and a degree of compassion, so that the hearer is willing to listen and comply instead of being offended and alienated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my recent visit with the people of Bong and Nimba, for example, I suggested that the people interacted with me as if I had Ebola, in order for me to behave in like manner, without my hosts being offended, as well as demonstrating the easiest way to remain safe. People should be told that if you or someone you care about should contract the Ebola virus, do not be ashamed, report to the nearest medical center; getting Ebola does not mean you are a bad person, only that you may not have taken the necessary precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cornerstone of a revised national strategy should be the employment of a new community-based vehicle for delivering the anti-Ebola message. The government needs to allow and empower individuals who have the confidence of their communities to be the vehicles through which the Ebola prevention message is delivered to the communities. The people are most likely to listen to and believe their own children and their local leaders. The effort must begin with the smallest socio-political unit outside of the family--the town/village. Each town or village has two types of leaders: chiefs appointed by the government, and chiefs/opinion leaders who exist outside of the government structure but who have earned the admiration, and therefore command the respect, of their people (the &quot;Community Opinion Leaders&quot;). It is the latter group of community leaders that the government needs to reach out to, convince about the reality of Ebola and how to prevent infection, and then empower them to get the anti-Ebola message to the people within their sphere of influence. Many among the former group have for too long been masquerading in Monrovia as traditional chiefs, without effective outreach to, and influence over their purported constituents. Any attempt to convey the anti-Ebola message through chiefs of the former group would prove futile at best. Their efforts would be summarily dismissed as those of yet another group of Monrovia or other urban politicians who have returned to their villages only to justify their government benefits. A similar fate would befall any&quot; community mobilization&quot; group whose members consist mainly of &quot;outsiders&quot; instead of local people of character, who not only understand the local customs, but also speak the local dialect(s).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community Opinion Leaders should be requested to create community cells consisting of young men and women of the village, who would serve as neighborhood watch teams. Properly trained and assisted by the Ministry of Health (MOH), they should be requested to track visitors to their community and all sick and dead persons. These local young people should also engage in contact tracing and prepare daily reports of their findings, based on an MOH template, to be picked up from the villages by the appropriate health workers based on a predetermined schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a means of restoring or enhancing confidence in its efforts, we also recommend that the government designate a single spokesperson/office, who will update the public through regular press conferences on the efforts of the different actors involved in the fight against the Ebola virus. These regular press conferences and public updates must also be used to provide proper accounting of the many donations and budgetary appropriations that have been made and will continue to be made for the fight against the Ebola virus. Half of the battle against the Ebola virus would be won if a strong and trusting relationship can be established between the people and the &quot;face&quot; of our national efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while our national focus is on arresting the spread of the virus and ultimately eradicating it from the country, it is not too early for the government to begin considering how we, as a nation, might memorialize our fallen brothers and sisters, including our foreign friends who succumbed to this virus while serving us. A simple memorial at each burial site, or one national memorial, that lists the names of the victims of the virus, would serve our nation well. The memorial(s) would be an effective means of bringing closure to this tragic epoch for many families; also, as a nation, the memorial would symbolize our resolve to survive and the unity with which we confronted this deadly enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight against the Ebola virus is a national effort, and the government must spare no effort to have all hands on deck. We can all learn from the collaboration of Liberians in the Diaspora under the banner &quot;We Stand as One,&quot; which has demonstrated that Liberians will work together when our national interest is at stake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her Excellency, Madam Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of the Republic of Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry of State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capitol Hill, Monrovia, Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Madam President:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola&quot; is a measure God is using to distinguish &quot;belief&quot; from &quot;unbelief&quot;. Do not stand in God's way. Ebola is not politic, withdraw yourself and those service men and women under your command, dissolve the Task Force on Ebola you setup, abolish the State of Emergency, lift the curfew, and turn the whole &quot;Ebola fight&quot; over to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and International health experts on Ebola in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, the way to eliminate Ebola is not to allow the virus to leave from the last person to anyone else. The process is not political but biological. Let the biologists do this and the credit be given to your government; and not to do so means, you are exposing yourself and your service men and women to danger that you have no idea about. Please, God needs to do his work, to separate &quot;unbelief&quot; away from among &quot;belief&quot;. Except&quot;, at least, more than half Liberians can hold to &quot;belief&quot;, so that there can be common agreement, this country can never develop. We must hold &quot;belief&quot; to agree together and work to place Liberia to her 1847 status among the community of nations. Therefore, those with &quot;unbelief&quot; must die; so that it will not be difficult to agree and build Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You (your-self self) look at the demonstration of &quot;unbelief&quot; (at the highest) by group of citizens in West Point; are you saying, with such people, can you ever agree on development plans to take this nation from where it is being brought? How can you politicize Ebola elimination to such an extent - going to West Point and elsewhere (at this time) and placing your service men/women around them? What if, (God forbid) one of them (Ebola infected due to unbelief) sneaks and even hold your feet, begging for mercy to be removed from quarantine, you will certainly be infected; and, when your service men/women rush to remove said person from you, they will surely get infected. Are you saying &quot;Liberia's President Ebola Infected&quot; should be another &quot;first&quot; about you in World History (again) too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, until now, Liberia has not become a one nation-state; because, every leadership (including yours) in Liberia do very little, if nothing at all, to make all Liberians feel and be a part of one nation which shared common vision and destiny. (And) the reason why you all have been doing this is very simple: to ensure the two class-structures are constant - the &quot;rich&quot; and the &quot;poor&quot;. Therefore, opportunities and access to resources are turn aside; so that, those (of you) in leadership must be &quot;rich&quot; (especially since no &quot;Claims Court&quot; in our justice system).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at how government is proceeding with Ebola-Money (too): purposefully delaying expenditure with all sorts of unnecessary bureaucracy; so that, when the international communities and personal efforts by the citizens (themselves) shall have brought an end to Ebola in Liberia, them, (like the &quot;Amara-Konneology&quot;: purposefully delaying governmental expenditures for the intended purposes until the budget year is over) parties are held with the huge left over of Ebola-Money. (We don't have Claims Court in our Justice System; so, they will go with impunity.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, please understand that, the concrete effort with this Ebola fight is aimed at developing a sense of common national identity based on shared vision or common ownership. What you should be doing at this time is studying how, after Ebola, you will balance yourself between the &quot;old guide&quot; and the &quot;post Ebola reformist-common ownership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are our leader. Please go indoor (as well as your commandaries) and fight Ebola on your knees before God (the Lord Jesus Christ) in prayers while studying how to cope with the aftermath of Ebola. There will be children who have lost both parents to Ebola, how do they live? (It is your question to answer; because, you are the President). Your physical appearances in Ebola areas (just a political scene) exposes you to the realm of unbelief; because, if you truly believe that Ebola is here, and it is real and it kills, and that you are not an expert on Ebola, will you want to proof, exposing yourself to the virus, &quot;FIRST&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, imagine the news (world-wide): Liberia Service/Security (Police, Army) infected with Ebola, how will that make you feel? You have exposed those service men/women unprotected to face people who know they have Ebola and do not want to die alone; especially, if it is someone who has odds with the government, don't you see danger? Please, you are exposing Liberia to international disrepute (whoever may be advising you, their intent is Ebola-Money).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process to fight and win Ebola, without pushing the Government off gear, requires political will by you and your government, commitment and sacrifice from all Liberians. It involves mobilizing every citizens and residents alike, to trace the travelling of Ebola from one person to the other. Therefore, you and we have to stay in one place. Let the experts trace the travelling of Ebola. (You know, when you move, group of people move with you).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, the aftermath of Ebola is so challenging, and it warrants all of your attention now. Governance will not be approached &quot;Amara-Konneologily&quot; (creating unnecessarily bureaucratic bottle necks purposefully to delay expenditures till end of budget year), because, Ebola will achieve: &quot;Liberia, one nation which shared common vision and destiny, having common ownership. The two class structures cannot and will no longer be constant in the history of the Republic of Liberia. The middle class structure has got to come into play. (The &quot;Ebola-Money&quot; will be the &quot;Kola&quot; baboon will divide - be aware!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for your Presidential understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sincerely yours,</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six persons who survived the Ebola virus in Grand Bassa County have been reunited with their families and communities, a county health official has disclosed. Speaking during the Ebola Task Force briefing held in Buchanan at the weekend, Joyce Garblah, a member of the County Health Team, said the six survivors who earlier tested positive with Ebola, were transferred to the Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said after undergoing treatment and observation, they were pronounced free of the virus and allowed to rejoin their families. Madam Garblah has disclosed that 26 confirmed Ebola deaths occurred in Grand Bassa County from July to September 26, 2014. She said out of the 26 confirmed Ebola deaths, 15 were males and 11 females, while 44 Ebola probable and suspected cases were recorded in the six districts of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to statistics, Buchanan District recorded 20, Owensgrove District six, District #One, seven; District #Two, six; District #Three, four and District #Four, one. Meanwhile, Garblah has disclosed that five samples taken to the National Diagnostic Lab in Marshall are awaiting results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Madam Garblah has disclosed that several families in eight communities in Buchanan District have been quarantined and are undergoing observation for between 21- 30 days. They are one family each in Dirt Hole, Preston Street, Open Bible, Old Field, Water and Sewer Community, Joezohn, and Payneberry and two families in Gbarpu Town in Tubmanville. LINA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2391 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a reflective analysis that will take us to our horrible past if not handled with caution. I hope that this would make everyone of us to rethink about where we came from and where we are as citizens of this great nation are heading if we don't reflect. The late Bob Marley said &quot;if you know your history, you will know where you came from&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Liberian, I am deeply concerned and not commenting would mean to me the worst form of tyranny to the nation and its people. As such, I have decided to direct my thoughts into writing which will serve as a reminder for many Liberians who perhaps don't know where we are. Now, get along with me. Little over a decade ago, we almost lost our nation owing to the collapse of some fundamental rudiments of Good governance within our nation. We selected by our action and inactions to pursue the path that enslaved, sold, fought and ruined our nation. The time is now than ever before especially with the opportunity it affords us to fight in defeating this deadly engine of separation and sorrow referred to as the Ebola virus disease (EVD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola should be and is our common enemy against which we must form a common alliance to defeat regardless of our diverse political ideologies and interests. This goes to bear why two fighting men would immediately abandon their fight and form an alliance against an intruding lion. Let us not allow cowards and so called state actors with personal political agenda to once more divide us as has always been in time past. This is another attempt to sidetrack us from the path of our individual and collective efforts as patriotic Liberians, in contributing to the development, stability of our once failed state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unarguably, in some cases we have maintained certain descending prepositions in our concepts of governance as well as in the strategies for socio-economic development and reconstruction of our nation. Yes, there are times where we disagreed with each other which have been promoted widely across the nation to freely express our different positions by the articulations of diverse views making use of the mass media and especially with the assistance of the table mountain declaration should not be carried over to this common patrimonial battle against a virus as deadly as Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, this is time for us to unite on one front in ensuring a violent free environment of governance; so as to earn, harness, promote and sustain the relative peace gained during this critical period of our national image management, in the history of our nation. It had been for long time since our essential documents were questioned even within our very MRU sub-region, Africa and the world at large ranging from driver licenses to travel documents. We were not conceited to identify ourselves outside of our nation with obvious fear of being forced to fashion white lie, stigmatization, denial or castigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recall exile life in Deckie, Guinea which is approximately 45km away from my home town Kpein, near the commercial capital of Nimba (Gompa city), situated in the northern part of Liberia also about 251km away from Monrovia. Some points in time, just to acquire land for farming and hunting, we concealed our identities. It became easy for us because cultures and languages have their own ways of uniting people. Liberians, let us not pretend about this: growing up in a third world country in sub Sahara Africa and like any other child in a rural setting, I was encouraged to help my people, set trap, fetched palm wine, hunted amongst others that which I was very successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can clearly comment to the memory on how I went in opposition to my strength of character even though voicing it out would have been a serious form of disrespect to the highest level against my parents. By this, with no much option, I imprisoned my thoughts abiding by the common Law which states that he that succeeds must always give certain defined portion as a sense of gratitude to the owner of the land; otherwise the attending law was expected to come in effect. Yes, I still recall how our travel documents including passports and visas were treated with disdain at other international port terminals. We were embarrassed and despoiled to identify with our now so cherished country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians, let us be reminded, there is too much at stake to proceed on personal aggrandizement. Our post-conflict economy is bleeding, potential investors are leaving day by day, and negative perception is now on the increase with the outside world which has an adverse consequence on our country's international morality. This is quite significant to remind us of the troubled war years when we were all left alone to face our self-made atrocities because of same self-proclaimed nationalists. Not until the latter stages when international interventions began to come in the forms of peacekeeping and humanitarian aids that we can now boost of a decade-earned peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this virus that has claimed over 1,500 precious lives of our compatriots, policy makers are forced to adjust the pending mid-term senatorial election. As a result, 15 senators will now be serving us in the Liberian senate without the people's expressed mandates as of October 14, 2014, upon the completion of their constitutional term of office. In my view, just like the way the civil war compelled us to have had two sets of Special Elections in 1997 and 2005 respectively, so we shall do so in this case to avoid a constitutional crisis of 'illegal 15 senators'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At our institutions of learning where competitions were believed to have kicked off with others outside of the country have just dropped again, are we thinking? Do you care to recount the distances we covered? It took us long time to get this much desired privilege signal as a developing nation with a success story, and as such, we must guide it with our teeth at all times. If not careful, we might start all over struggling again, a cost we can't afford to pay easily, it took us long to get to where we were prior to the Ebola Crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team against itself and a complete war within as we face the Ebola battle, is one that may be termed as the cabinet in opposition to itself due to the lack of coordinating team work of some key cabinet members and other relevant high profile officials of this regime. There is a need to recognize the distinctive mark between Legislative function and Executive power; and avoid the continuous confusion that exists across the fifteen political subdivisions of the country. It is ironical for policy makers to engage in a wrestle on their young rice farm. We are losing this national fight led by the Executive in the administration of our government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst challenges the country is faced with, some of which are created as a result of shared ignorance, deceit, dishonesty, undermining, over-ambition, pride, incompetence generational envy, ethnic loyalty, and other deadly disasters like Ebola, Aids &amp;HIVs. One can safely surmise that we are running on empty gas tank, as this is not the time to fight or prove who is working in the eye of a status quos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Empirically, this runs counterclockwise to the concept of any successful government in the history of national governance. This is not time to see another cabinet colleague struggles and fails, just to prove a point, you may have come on different boat but at present, we all are on the same ship Liberia (nationalism).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my mind, the Liberian cabinet needs an urgent unification and resuscitation so as to protect the government's image and the president's legacy as already implied in their respective mandates. We have to cultivate the spirit of practical, measurable, and realistic patriotism. Liberians have to always exhibit good example by standing up bright and tall in Africa and not seasonal. We did it before why not now? Let us develop and nurture a common core by putting Liberia first as without it, the term Liberia is only a fabrication of imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have accepted to understand and pardon people, whenever I retrospect on my late maternal Grand -father (Charles D. Wynn) former Post Master General of Liberia. Who said &quot;when you go fishing with an arrogant individual always try to acquaint him with the rules. In the event, he overlooks it, allow him to experience for himself. Whenever you notice him going deeper try to rescue him and give a second chance by reminding him of the attending vulnerability. He will appreciate and better understand you the next time... .then rather allowing him to dive deep and die.&quot; This is the exact stage we as people of this nation have reached, the wall street journal, Beneditkt, M. (1991) Cyberspace:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no mistakes in life but only lessons and lessons will keep on repeating until learned&quot;. This second chance will mean nothing if we never learn the lessons of our first mistakes. Liberians, our national interest is at stalk, let us galvanize support to have it rescued rationally. We all owe it as part of the national agency of the state; together we are able to create a better nation that we will be satisfied with. Let us focus on tolerance and peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature, but on a gradual evolution in institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us focus on series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the best interest of all concerned. By defining our goal more clearly, making it more manageable and less remote, we can make everyone to see it, to draw hope from actual national reality that will reinforce humanity's belief and sustain our hopes for a wonderful life for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before this ink runs waterless, permit me to add my voice to the many well meaning Liberians home and abroad in expressing our deepest sadness and regret over the west point clashes between some alleged state securities and armless civilians, resulting to the death of little Shaki Kamara. I was privileged to have watched on a local television station the scene which reminds me about our repulsive past that once plunged us into a state of confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find it difficult to comprehend that the state's army first national exercise of duty would rise to such a challenge and be marked with controversies. It leaves one to hypothesize on what would have probably precipitated such a miscalculated action, with the many international exposures it has to its credit, coupled with a deep sense of human rights; good Leadership and huge political will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A moment, where we are transitioning for ownership of our national security to have witnessed such, is totally disappointing to me and certainly all well meaning Liberians. Accordingly, the alleged executors might have heard if not orientated on the difference between a state of emergency and a marching order from the desk of the commander in Chief of the Armed forces of Liberia. When do we expect the applicability of the defense intelligence accolade earned? Simple terrain appreciation would have provided the appropriate signal that many of us Liberians are angry, emotional, marked with different cultural divide and other personal habits. This is a national dishonor, but thanks to the President for her far sightedness in commissioning an immediate investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howbeit, I welcome the level of urgency the Chief Executive had given the committee's report, hope the recommendation will fully be implemented in the interest of incontestable peace and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I am appealing to the Liberian security apparatus, specifically our newly formed Army to exercise high level of crisis management concept with best international practices. Nevertheless, I like to admonish other state actors, alternative government (opposition) and their respective supporters to avoid acts that have the propensity to undermine the peace and tranquility of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several uninterrupted years in power, our generation is robbed and denied the opportunity of soft landing as required, leaving our country in deep red by past leaders. Bear in mind that our peace and security rest on your shoulders; we have had enough ugly past which continue to affect our lives reason why our generation today curve towards instant gratification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, we got lost and fell short of the needed humanistic capital, resulting to missing identity (disconnect). I have no hesitation in pointing out that each one of us is as ultimately attached to this land as the other. Every time one of us wakes up and sees our country we feel a sense of personal renewal. We are moved by a sense of joy and sadness when our national Anthem is played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That spiritual and physical oneness we all share with this common homeland explains the vitality of our pain we carry in our hearts as we see square in rectangle and amateurs tear our efforts apart. My fellow Liberians, let us enter into a covenant that we will build a Liberia in which all of us will be able to walk freely without any fear in our hearts, assured of our inalienable rights to human dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me lengthen my recognition and appreciation to our global partners, business houses who are contributing in the fight against this continental humiliation to mankind. I would like to keep in mind those who continue to be affected as a result of risking their lives in the provision of medical and humanitarian services across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably, those who lost their lives while on compassionate duty to the people of Liberia and the sub-region, the National Health Services, our national janitorial services team that maintain cleaning our surroundings, et cetera. Airlines that departed in preparation to return and join this battle and those remain during this crisis; I say to you, we will always keep you in our memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, I extol the government and people of the United States of America, China and other friendly nations for standing by us during this challenging period of our national existence. No doubt, we appreciate you!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May God help us all and be part of this history. We will smile again! &quot;Liberia first, Liberia last&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPECIAL REPORT FROM IAN BIRRELL IN MONROVIA, LIBERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS I walked into the walled Hindu-style cremation site outside Monrovia alongside the latest consignment of bodies, I saw a smouldering pile of ashes with smoke rising from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scattered among the flickering flames were clearly visible human bones: femurs, hip joints and even the odd skull.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the remains of 15 ebola victims, their highly-contagious corpses set ablaze the night before on open pyres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Look at that,  said Stephen Rowden, a former landscape gardener from Essex overseeing the safe collection and elimination of corpses for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). He pointed to a massive mound of ash with more bits of bone sticking out:  That is more than 700 bodies. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a very disturbing sight, underlining the immense human tragedy of this crisis that is ravaging parts of West Africa. Livestock incinerators imported from Britain are now replacing those open pyres. But this was just one among many horrifying scenes that confronted me in the heart of this alarming and worsening ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the bewildered family I met by the side of a street in Monrovia. The man was cradling his four-year-old daughter, her listless head flopped on his shoulder, while beside him stood his other two remaining children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tailor by profession, this courteous man had seen his eldest child and mother die in recent days. Now his six-year-old son Jabbi looked lost, while his daughter Jenneba, 22, seemed the sickest I have seen anyone still standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenneba s face was pale, her mouth turned down in pain, she sweated profusely.  I think I have ebola,  she whispered to me.  I have been ill since last week. I am so scared.  Her father Victor was desperately trying to get his children tested at a new clinic opened with 150 beds to cope with this fearsome disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I want treatment so badly for them,  he said, explaining how their grandmother was the first family member to go down with classic ebola symptoms of diarrhoea, headaches and vomiting.  Now my children all have it. I am afraid for them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These pitiful people were among the latest victims of the world s worst ebola epidemic, which is spinning out of control and snaring more people in its deadly grip each day. I met them in the epidemic s epicentre as families fought for treatment and a crippled nation fights for its very survival with curfews and bans on social contact, while heroic teams of medics and hygienists risk their lives to fight an invisible enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet already the Island Clinic was overflowing with patients after just two days in operation, so health workers in protective suits patiently explained that they could admit no more people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man pointed to a person lying deathly still on the back seat of a taxi, a single leg poking out from the blanket covering him.  That is my brother - look at him. They will not take him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As security staff pushed back people begging for help, an anguished woman in a white cardigan had tears streaming down her face.  My children, my sister, are sick but why will no one do anything to help them?  she wailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She turned to me with arms outstretched:  Why will no one help my family? What can we do, please God what can we do? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I felt ashamed since I had no answer. The awful truth was her family faced a terrible death - and the chances were she might follow them to the grave. Indeed, her children may be dead already. Just like that little girl and her sickly sister, just like the prostrate man in the taxi - and just like growing numbers of people in this blighted nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOME families said they were hiding in their homes and staying away from friends. Traditional handshakes have been abandoned; one man told me he had not even touched his children for nearly three months  because I love them so much .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main airport, even some supermarkets, take your temperature before permitting entry while buckets of chlorinated water stand outside public buildings from bars to shops. I have never washed my hands, let alone sprayed my shoes, so often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slowly, the world is starting to recognise the scale of this epidemic that broke out last December in a small Guinean village. It was not confirmed for almost four months, giving the disease time to spread across a region never struck by it before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the official death toll has passed 3,000 - although one unpublished study of the imperfect data available indicates this is just one-third of the real number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has warned of 17,000 more fatalities over the next six weeks. One worst-case scenario predicts 1.4million deaths in Liberia and Sierra Leone alone by the end of the epidemic - more than one in ten of their populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts on the ground admit they have no idea what will happen as they struggle to curb this aggressive strain of a virus that starts like a common cold and ends with collapsed organs and blood pouring from orifices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak is killing seven in ten victims and spreading fast after hitting urban areas for the first time in ebola s history, which makes it tricky to contain by isolating the afflicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its centre lies Liberia, home to nearly two-thirds of infections - many of them among the one million people living in the crowded capital Monrovia.  We have never seen anything like this,  said Laurence Sailly, the head of mission for MSF, one of only two international organisations daring to run treatment centres in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is fear of this disease because it is not like any other and there is no known cure. The longer it lasts, the more difficult it is to control.  Ultimately it is a numbers game. Each infected case spreads the virus to two other people on average if not isolated, so it rips through families and tight-knit communities with lethal speed and cruelty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And fewer than one in five cases are cared for in centres that reduce risk of transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF has created a fast-expanding treatment unit, which has 200 beds with only 290 other beds available across the rest of Liberia. It is nicknamed  the death cage  by locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the high-risk zone patients lie groaning softly or screaming in pain, their heads pounding as they puke ceaselessly, tended by staff looking like aliens in goggles and heavy-duty protective clothing that drains their energy in the intense heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before I visited MSF took in 31 new cases, replacing the dead or the fortunate few discharged. Only the worst cases are admitted; one worker told me of five entrants asked to wait for tests and then all five found slumped dead in their chairs just half an hour later. Sometimes as many are sent away as taken inside.  It is awful turning away people who are really sick, some lying on the ground unable to walk, others begging for their lives,  said Stefan Liljegren, the Swedish field co-ordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We re telling them to go back by taxi and spread the disease. It is like a horror movie.  Outside I found a family of nine from a nearby village wanting to be tested. They had one teenage girl already in the compound, but were told five-year-old Emmanuel was not yet sick enough to join her despite starting to vomit badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although given a protective kit of disinfectant, masks and gloves, the family was dismayed.  We ve been using our bare hands with the little boy, who has been very sick. We could not sleep last night - the fear of ebola is now here for us,  said Varney Varfee, a driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little wonder some on the front line confessed to crying in their masks.  I find the children the most distressing, like a little baby girl who died the other night,  said Cokie van der Velde, a sanitation expert from Yorkshire working with MSF.  And it is going to get a lot worse - we are simply not taking enough infected people out of the population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This crisis comes in a country only recently emerged from devastating civil war, judged the world s most corrupt and run by a Nobel Prize-winning president admired in the West but mistrusted by many fellow citizens. Liberia had poor healthcare before the crisis, with fewer than 200 doctors for 4million people. Those infected include 184 health workers, many among ebola s earliest victims before safety protocols were put in place, while other critical conditions now go untreated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was shown shocking photographs taken covertly in the government-run Redemption Hospital revealing corpses left in faeces and a dead woman abandoned beside a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an entire nation in virtual quarantine, a fast-growing economy has plunged towards recession. One shopkeeper said takings had fallen by one-third, while panic buying and import problems have driven up the price of staple foods such as rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government minister even warned last week the crisis could send the region spiralling into renewed conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street posters declare  Ebola is Real  and detail symptoms. Yet such is the distrust of officials that many still do not believe there is a real threat, fearing some kind of scam to cream off funds or steal the bodies from families that want to wash and bury them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This became obvious when out with Mark Korvayan, a ministry of health official who criss-crosses Monrovia s potholed streets with his body collection team. At each stop he had to give a health lecture and explain their actions to grieving and often sceptical communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am afraid for myself, for my family, for my team,  he told me.  We are fighting an enemy we cannot see but many people are still in denial. They insist it is just malaria. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the final stop for an old man in a cluster of fishing shacks beside the sea, a neighbour accused the burial squad of selling bodies and started screaming abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched as several youths appeared armed with sticks and a fight broke out. Korvayan said that in another incident, a man even climbed on their open lorry containing the corpses. He ended up infecting his entire family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain and the US have announced big programmes to help tackle ebola, pledging to build clinics and train staff - although implementation details remain sketchy and there are fears they are being far too slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Point, a notorious slum on a spit of sand feared as a hotbed of criminality by other Liberians, some of the 83,000 residents have organised themselves with military-style precision into teams tracking down cases and spreading safety messages.  This is a demonstration of love for my community and my country,  said Archie C Bassay, an unemployed man who now leads a team of 105 volunteers paid $50 a month.  But every day more people are dying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bassay introduced me to a midwife showing symptoms of ebola and a teacher who lost his son, then showed me the empty house of a seven-strong family all struck by the virus. His team has 62 cases being advised on care and rudimentary isolation in their own homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet even now, after so much trauma, this terrible disease still carries a stigma with local health workers admitting some people were afraid of them.  Some staff have even been thrown out of their homes for working here,  said Sametta George, a nurse with MSF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw this fear when the world s youngest ebola survivor - a two-month-old baby called Jusu Kromah -  graduated  from their clinic. After his mother died, an uncle agreed to bring up the boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet when he bought his family to collect the child, the women were petrified. One started shaking and crying, refusing to hold Jusu and impervious to staff assurances he was safe to touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby was another survivor.  It was horrible but thank God I survived. I feel so happy to be out and grateful to be alive,  said Foday Jallah, 37, a nurse and ambulance driver who caught the virus caring for a sick orphan.  It was certainly an experience in my life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave me a huge smile when I said that was the biggest understatement I had ever heard. It was a rare glimpse of joy and hope amid the hell of this escalating ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do these statements about Africa have in common? A white farmer is killed every five days in South Africa. Earlier this year Nigerian Islamists Boko Haram burnt 375 Christians alive. The Democratic Republic of Congo is the rape capital of the world. Johannesburg is the world's biggest man-made forest. Answer: despite being widely accepted, none of them is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an age when information cascades down Twitter feeds by the millisecond, it is increasingly difficult to sieve for facts, especially when it relates to much of Africa. Step forward newcomer websites such as BudgIT and Africa Check, who are hoping to usher in the kind of non-partisan data and fact-checking services made popular by the likes of PolitiFact and others in the west.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their daunting tasks range from tackling the sort of popular myths which once led outsiders to cast Africa as a land of giant birds and cannibals, to taking on officials in countries where data is often sketchy and accountability even more so. By poking holes in accepted narratives, the websites' creators hope to &quot;kickstart people's sceptical reflex,&quot; said Peter Cunliffe-Jones, an Africa Check founder and journalist who formerly worked in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That country has a particularly fearsome reputation when it comes to sorting fact from fiction. This week, the military claimed - for a second time - that dozens of almost 300 schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamists Boko Haram had been freed amid an &quot;ongoing&quot; rescue operation. None had been, and the statement was later retracted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can be difficult to get hold of reliable information anywhere,&quot; said Cunliffe-Jones. &quot;But (in Nigeria) there hasn't always been a culture of holding people to account for what they say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2000, during riots in the northern city of Kaduna, Cunliffe-Jones stood on a hotel roof and watched as policemen oversaw the loading of at least eight large trucks with the bodies of those killed in the clashes. By his most conservative estimate, at least 400 corpses were trucked away. The police later insisted only 37 died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we said to them, we know 37 is not even vaguely correct, they told us, look, we are trying to keep the peace,&quot; Cunliffe-Jones said. &quot;But the result is nobody trusts the authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fledgling website headquartered in the journalism department of Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, hopes to foster a culture where even simple statements can be verified before they are picked up by local newspapers, and sometimes foreign ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misinformation can have severe practical consequences. That has recently been illustrated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, where many people's initial conviction that the Ebola outbreak was a hoax created by their governments to plunder public coffers led to them disregarding health warnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally, some international coverage of the outbreak was accused of misinforming western readers. In August, US magazine Newsweek ran a front cover with a chimp and the warning: &quot;A back door for Ebola: smuggled bushmeat could spark a US epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't have any evidence for the claims they were making. There's zero evidence that bushmeat smuggling could bring Ebola to the US,&quot; said academic Laura Seay who co-authored a scathing takedown of the article. &quot;It was just fear-baiting, and like a lot of the coverage on Ebola, overtly racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek's editor dismissed Seay's claims with a tweet saying: &quot;Troll better you should be ashamed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inaccurate media reports are hardly limited to Africa, but there's a greater chance of international newspapers getting things wrong - and not admitting so - when it comes to the continent, Seay said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When most western outlets have just two or three people covering a continent of 11 million square miles, it very easy to make mistakes, even unintentionally. It's a recipe for disaster in terms of quality of coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around half of Africa Check's investigations are triggered by readers wanting to know anything from the veracity of claims made by pop stars to supposed disease-busting local herbs. Operating out of Lagos and Johannesburg, the not-for-profit organisation funded by grants and individual donations has a team of five full-timers working alongside volunteers and freelancers, and hopes to expand to Kenya and Senegal next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anton Harber, a highly-regarded South African former investigative journalist and co-founder of the project, explained its ultimate aim. &quot;I imagine a situation in which every public figure and journalist feels nervous about what they say or write because Africa Check might just catch them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A makeshift jungle hospital - tents, corrugated iron roofs and bright orange barriers - looks more like some kind of sinister detention centre. The people here are even more sinister-looking, in orange plastic suits, white boots, green gloves, headdresses, masks, ski goggles, and not an inch of actual person visible; they could be aliens. But these are the staff, the doctors. They're like this because we're in Sierra Leone and this is Unreported World: Surviving Ebola (Channel 4).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks like a nightmare. It is a nightmare - if anything, the title is misleadingly optimistic. The death ledger book is filling up. There have been 73 deaths in the past month alone. The body of the latest, a nine-year-old boy, still highly infectious, is carried to the morgue, a small bundle in a white plastic sheet. He will be buried round the back in a clearing that is rapidly running out of space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victims have been hiding at home and infecting their families. More patients arrive, six members of one family, staggering out of an ambulance, very sick and very scared. The ambulances double up as hearses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people come in a van that is sprayed with chlorine after every journey. Like this mother and her daughter. But the mother is already dead. As her body is carried to the morgue, the seven-year-old cries out: &quot;I'm feeling cold, sir, I'm feeling cold.&quot; A tiny utterance, but one of the saddest things I've ever heard. She dies later, too. The van is sprayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as if that wasn't hell enough, there's a rumour in the nearby town that Ebola is just a hoax, devised by doctors to steal blood from people. They're rioting. Civil unrest to add to the terror, vomit, blood, diarrhoea and death, while Medecins Sans Frontieres doctors fight a battle it appears they cannot win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaunagh Connaire and Wael Dabbous's short film is a chilling and bleak one. It is also brave - there must have been some risk involved. And it is important. Of course you knew the Ebola story, but perhaps, like for me, it was just that - a news story, distant, and a name. This was a rude, visceral wake-up to the terrible reality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their daunting tasks range from tackling the sort of popular myths which once led outsiders to cast Africa as a land of giant birds and cannibals, to taking on officials in countries where data is often sketchy and accountability even more so. By poking holes in accepted narratives, the websites' creators hope to &quot;kickstart people's sceptical reflex,&quot; said Peter Cunliffe-Jones, an Africa Check founder and journalist who formerly worked in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That country has a particularly fearsome reputation when it comes to sorting fact from fiction. This week, the military claimed - for a second time - that dozens of almost 300 schoolgirls kidnapped by Islamists Boko Haram had been freed amid an &quot;ongoing&quot; rescue operation. None had been, and the statement was later retracted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can be difficult to get hold of reliable information anywhere,&quot; said Cunliffe-Jones. &quot;But (in Nigeria) there hasn't always been a culture of holding people to account for what they say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2000, during riots in the northern city of Kaduna, Cunliffe-Jones stood on a hotel roof and watched as policemen oversaw the loading of at least eight large trucks with the bodies of those killed in the clashes. By his most conservative estimate, at least 400 corpses were trucked away. The police later insisted only 37 died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we said to them, we know 37 is not even vaguely correct, they told us, look, we are trying to keep the peace,&quot; Cunliffe-Jones said. &quot;But the result is nobody trusts the authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fledgling website headquartered in the journalism department of Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, hopes to foster a culture where even simple statements can be verified before they are picked up by local newspapers, and sometimes foreign ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misinformation can have severe practical consequences. That has recently been illustrated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, where many people's initial conviction that the Ebola outbreak was a hoax created by their governments to plunder public coffers led to them disregarding health warnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally, some international coverage of the outbreak was accused of misinforming western readers. In August, US magazine Newsweek ran a front cover with a chimp and the warning: &quot;A back door for Ebola: smuggled bushmeat could spark a US epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't have any evidence for the claims they were making. There's zero evidence that bushmeat smuggling could bring Ebola to the US,&quot; said academic Laura Seay who co-authored a scathing takedown of the article. &quot;It was just fear-baiting, and like a lot of the coverage on Ebola, overtly racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek's editor dismissed Seay's claims with a tweet saying: &quot;Troll better you should be ashamed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inaccurate media reports are hardly limited to Africa, but there's a greater chance of international newspapers getting things wrong - and not admitting so - when it comes to the continent, Seay said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When most western outlets have just two or three people covering a continent of 11 million square miles, it very easy to make mistakes, even unintentionally. It's a recipe for disaster in terms of quality of coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around half of Africa Check's investigations are triggered by readers wanting to know anything from the veracity of claims made by pop stars to supposed disease-busting local herbs. Operating out of Lagos and Johannesburg, the not-for-profit organisation funded by grants and individual donations has a team of five full-timers working alongside volunteers and freelancers, and hopes to expand to Kenya and Senegal next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anton Harber, a highly-regarded South African former investigative journalist and co-founder of the project, explained its ultimate aim. &quot;I imagine a situation in which every public figure and journalist feels nervous about what they say or write because Africa Check might just catch them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">350 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A makeshift jungle hospital - tents, corrugated iron roofs and bright orange barriers - looks more like some kind of sinister detention centre. The people here are even more sinister-looking, in orange plastic suits, white boots, green gloves, headdresses, masks, ski goggles, and not an inch of actual person visible; they could be aliens. But these are the staff, the doctors. They're like this because we're in Sierra Leone and this is Unreported World: Surviving Ebola (Channel 4).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks like a nightmare. It is a nightmare - if anything, the title is misleadingly optimistic. The death ledger book is filling up. There have been 73 deaths in the past month alone. The body of the latest, a nine-year-old boy, still highly infectious, is carried to the morgue, a small bundle in a white plastic sheet. He will be buried round the back in a clearing that is rapidly running out of space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victims have been hiding at home and infecting their families. More patients arrive, six members of one family, staggering out of an ambulance, very sick and very scared. The ambulances double up as hearses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people come in a van that is sprayed with chlorine after every journey. Like this mother and her daughter. But the mother is already dead. As her body is carried to the morgue, the seven-year-old cries out: &quot;I'm feeling cold, sir, I'm feeling cold.&quot; A tiny utterance, but one of the saddest things I've ever heard. She dies later, too. The van is sprayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as if that wasn't hell enough, there's a rumour in the nearby town that Ebola is just a hoax, devised by doctors to steal blood from people. They're rioting. Civil unrest to add to the terror, vomit, blood, diarrhoea and death, while Medecins Sans Frontieres doctors fight a battle it appears they cannot win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaunagh Connaire and Wael Dabbous's short film is a chilling and bleak one. It is also brave - there must have been some risk involved. And it is important. Of course you knew the Ebola story, but perhaps, like for me, it was just that - a news story, distant, and a name. This was a rude, visceral wake-up to the terrible reality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 35-year-old man in Zwedru, Grand Gedeh County, has tested Ebola positive, making it the first case in the county since the outbreak of the disease in the country in March. The man, whose name is being withheld by the Liberia News Agency, was showing signs and symptoms of the disease when the Grand Gedeh County Health Team (CHT) picked him up from the Zwedru Central Market last Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief interview with the Liberia News Agency Wednesday, the Coordinator of the CHT, Netus Nowena, said the man migrated from Ganta, Nimba County to Grand Gedeh County following the death of nine of his family members from the disease early this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nowena, the health team was taking the man to Gbarnga, Bong County for treatment when they observed that he was showing signs and symptoms of the virus, adding that he later tested positive for the disease. According to Nowena, the 36 people who were at the holding center for 21 days of observation have been released without any signs or symptoms of Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">737 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on Thursday, September 25, joined world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to participate in a High-Level Meeting on Response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, held under the leadership of United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, also had in attendance United States President Barrack Obama, World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan, World Bank President Dr. Jim Kim, African Union Commission Chairperson Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Guinean President Dr. Alpha Conde, Sierra Leonean President Ernest Bai Koroma, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Liberian leader, via a video link from the Monrovia office of the African Development Bank (AfDB), informed world leaders that Liberia today is faced with the greatest challenge because it cannot allow the projection of a worst case scenario that over 100,000 innocent citizens will die from an invisible disease they did not start and do not understand. She stressed that the resulting effect of this epidemic will reverse the gains in malaria, child and maternal mortality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said the deadly Ebola virus disease has so far taken the lives of over 1,700 persons, including 85 of those trained to save lives. She indicated that as a consequence of the disease, livelihoods are being threatened, there has become a precipitous decline in economic activities, loss of income and jobs, health services have deteriorated, prices of basic commodities have increased and there is limitation in free movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Partners and friends, based on understandable fear, have ostracized us; shipping and airline services have sanctioned us; and the world has taken some time to fully appreciate and adequately respond to the enormity of our tragedy,&quot; President Sirleaf emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the High-Level Meeting that Liberia is fighting with the support of many of its partners; adding that the country is intensifying its response, building and staffing more treatment centers across the country and moving more aggressively to prevent the transmission and change in behavior through community outreach and ownership programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said Liberians have proudly developed a resilient spirit of overcoming great tragedies and with the help of its partners is poised to do so once again. &quot;We thank many of you around this table who have joined in the fight; partners who through robust response have given us renewed trust in the value of partnership; partners who have given us renewed hope in a bright future for our children,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the world that not long ago Liberia was the epicenter of a regional war by which it experienced the total economic collapse and massive destruction of infrastructure and institutions, adding that the country has faced many challenges in its historical journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In separate statements earlier, U.S. President Barrack Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, World Bank President Jim Kim and AU Commission Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said the world needs to act and act very quickly to address the Ebola epidemic plaguing the West African sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They indicated that the world has not done enough to contain the further spread of the virus and urged countries and international organization to remove red tapes in their processes to respond quickly and urgently to the epidemic. The World Bank committed an additional US$400 million to the fight against the disease and urged the world to unite in the fight to defeat the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinean President Alpha Conde and Sierra Leonean President Ernest Bai Koroma joined President Sirleaf to call for a united global action to bring the world's deadliest outbreak to a quick end and prevent thousands of innocent men, women and children from dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, President Sirleaf has dismissed, with immediate effect, the Assistant Minister for Sectorial Planning at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, Jeremiah Krah for assaulting Police officer Beauty Mulbah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader described as &quot;unacceptable&quot; an assault on a law enforcement officer, particularly a female, by an official of the government and trust that the action will serve as a deterrent to others in government who would want to use their positions to abuse and violate the rights of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">787 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is true that members of the international community are fully awake and united in their desire to help the Ebola-besieged West African countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, getting the promised goodwill on the ground has not been as quick as the pronouncements of the help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distance of the affected region from many well-off countries, perhaps coupled with bureaucratic bottlenecks, has clogged the expeditious delivery of much-needed aid. And the unmerciful Ebola virus disease is not waiting. The rate of infection is galloping by the day as the rate of fatalities. President Barack Obama, who has promised the bulk of efforts to contain the outbreak, doesn't appear happy with the slowness, and wants global efforts to move with a speed faster than the pace of the virus. The Analyst Reports</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;International organizations have to move even faster, and mobilize partners on the ground as only they can. More nations need to contribute critical assets and capabilities - whether it's air transport, medical evacuation, health care workers, equipment, or treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were the words of President Barack Obama of the United States in his remarks he delivered at the UN High-Level Meeting on Ebola at the United Nations yesterday in New York. He called on more foundations to quickly tap into their networks of support, to raise funding and awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More businesses, especially those with a presence in the region, can quickly provide their own expertise and resources, from access to critical supply chains to telecommunications. And more citizens - of all nations - can educate themselves on this crisis, contribute to relief efforts and call on their leaders to act. Everyone can do something. That's why we're here today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said even as the international community was endeavoring to meet the urgent threat of Ebola, &quot;it's clear that our nations must do more to prevent, detect and respond to future biological threats - before they erupt into full-blown crises. &quot;Tomorrow in Washington,&quot; he said, meaning today, &quot;I will host 44 nations to advance our global health security. And we will work with any country that shares that commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, stopping Ebola is a priority for the United States, which he said will continue to lead, and do its part, adding: &quot;But this must also be a priority for the world.&quot; He assured the leaders of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and the people of West Africa, particularly the heroic health workers racing to save lives that they are not alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working urgently to get you the help you need. And we will not stop, we will not cease, we will not relent until we halt this epidemic, once and for all,&quot; he promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama acknowledged that Ebola is a horrific disease, wiping out whole families, and turning &quot;simple acts of love and comfort like holding a sick friend's hand, or embracing a dying child into potentially fatal acts.&quot; He told the General Assembly that if ever there were a public health emergency deserving of an urgent, strong and coordinated international response, this is it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this is more than a health crisis,&quot; he continued. &quot;This is a growing threat to regional and global security. In Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, public health systems are near collapse. Economic growth is slowing dramatically.&quot; The United States President said if the epidemic is not stopped, this disease could cause a humanitarian catastrophe across the region and that in an era when regional crises can quickly become global threats, stopping Ebola is in the interests of the entire world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that courageous men and women are fighting on the front lines of this disease and they &quot;have told us what they need: more beds, more supplies, and more health workers, as fast as possible. Right now, patients are being left to die in the streets because there's nowhere to put them and no one to help them. One health worker in Sierra Leone compared fighting this outbreak to 'fighting a forest fire with spray bottles.' With our help, they can put out the blaze.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama reported to the General Assembly that a US Commander is on the ground in Monrovia, and the country teams are working as fast as they can to move personnel, equipment and supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're working with Senegal to stand up an air bridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster,&quot; he asserted. &quot;We're setting up a field hospital, which will be staffed by personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service, and a training facility, where we're getting ready to train thousands of health workers from around the world. We're distributing supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families, so they can better protect themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">NOCAL Boosts Ebola Fight - Contributions Exceed Us$500k</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">718 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps due to the massive outpour of local, national and international supports and contributions to the fight against Ebola in Liberia, some pundits are tempted to posit that if the deadly virus proves recalcitrant to recede in a short while, it would not be because of the absence of the material and financial resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For in the last two months, goodwill contributions and interventions, particularly amongst Liberians and nationally-based groups and individuals have reached competitive proportions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one person or institution wants to be left out from the pages of history that will bear the names of those who fought the virus, one way or the other. Even the widow's might is coming out. But there are institutions or institutions that are taking the front rows as far as the scope and size of interventions are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst them is the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), traditionally known for its passion for corporate social responsibility in the country. As The Analyst reports, the company's contributions have hit beyond half a million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Oil Company of Liberia has stepped up its support towards efforts to contain the spread of the Ebola virus in Liberia. The company has now contributed more than a quarter of a million dollars in cash and essential health materials since the outbreak of the virus in Liberia more than six months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Engagement Manager of NOCAL, Mr. Jonathan Sogbie, made the disclosure when the company presented a consignment of assorted food items and clothing to the Ebola Treatment Unit-2 at ELWA and residents of district #6 affected by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also presented similar items to the John F. Kennedy Memorial hospital's Ebola Treatment Unit. The NOCAL official said the latest contributions are part of the company's effort to identify with Liberians during the public health emergency the country is experiencing. &quot;We all need to join the government in eradicating this disease from Liberia,&quot; he urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Board of Directors, the management and Staff of NOCAL, Mr. Sogbie praised the personal sacrifice health personnel continue to make in helping to save lives. He admonished all Liberians and others residing within the country to adhere to health tips issued by the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare to help contain the virus. Mr. Sogbie gave the assurance that NOCAL will continue to support government's efforts aimed at containing the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the ELWA treatment Unit, Dr. Jerry Brown, welcomed the donation by NOCAL and appealed for more medication to help treat patients. He admonished Liberians to continue to support and respect health workers as they perform their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Brown said the fight against Ebola will only succeed if Liberians follow health, safety measures and demonstrate appreciation towards health workers. He recalled an incident when a doctor working at the Emergency Treatment Unit was evicted from his residence by a landlord for fear that the doctor may infect other tenants. Such behavior, Dr. Brown, cautioned, does not help the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montserrado County Representative, Edwin M. Snowe, also commended NOCAL for supporting the efforts of the District Task Force in caring for residents quarantined in their homes. The latest presentation by NOCAL brings the oil company's total contribution towards the Ebola fight to US $291,500.00 (two-hundred ninety-one thousand five hundred dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, NOCAL presented a check for US $150,000.00 (one-hundred &amp; fifty-thousand dollars) towards the Ebola Trust Fund. The company recently presented Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare, worth over US $84,000.00 (eighty-four thousand dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL also contributed US $27,500.00 (twenty-seven thousand five-hundred dollars) to help airlift a consignment of essential medical supplies being brought into the country by Chevron-Liberia, Ltd., and its international partner, International Medical Equipment Collaborative (IMEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Task Force has since taken delivery of the items worth more than US $240,000.00 (two hundred forty-thousand-dollars). Recently, NOCAL presented several materials to a local Non-Governmental Organization, 'Feed the Future', in its effort to tackle the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports coming from the Central Province of Bong County say there were 36 new suspected Ebola cases in the County last week. This was disclosed by the head of the Bong County Ebola Response task force Superintendent Selena Polson Mappy last Thursday. Out the number, 21 died, she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Mappy also disclosed that four persons out of the number of confirmed cases that were treated at the Ebola Testing Unit have also died. Appearing on a live radio talk show, Info Box on Radio Gbarnga, Superintendent Mappy said, although the task force and other stakeholders continue to make progress in the fight against the killer disease in the County, more needs to be done to contain the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bong County task force chairperson called on citizens of the County to desist from denial and take preventive measures to avoid further spread of the virus. Superintendent Mappy said Liberia can only succeed in combating the killer disease when citizens accept the existence of the virus and join the fight, adding that plans are underway for the construction of another Ebola testing unit in the County. The Bong superintendent said the facility is expected to be constructed by the US Army at the former UNMIL base in Maimu Salala district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the Chairman of the Bong County Legislative Caucus has ended a fact finding visit to several Ebola affected communities in Fuamah District. The communities include Bong mines, Mahwah and Cephus town among others. The Bong County health team recently reported that there were eight suspected deaths in Fuamah district. Currently the District Commissioner, Hampton Giddings and 15 households are quarantined in Cephus town as the result of the Ebola outbreak in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the tour, Senator Henry Yallah told the citizens the visit was intended to ascertain the situation and to better prepare the Caucus to support the Ebola Response mechanism in the county. Residents of the communities told Senator Yallah the number of suspected deaths in the district requires attention to save the district, recommending that the district task force be provided logistical and financial support to set up auxiliary groups to increase awareness and contact tracing in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents are also appealing to the government and partners to put in place measures to regularly provide medication for people who are quarantined in the district, as doing so will disabuse the minds of affected persons who intend to escape to other communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents, however praised the County Ebola Response Task Force for the recent distribution of rice and other cooking utensils to affected households in the district. In response, Senator Yallah promised the County Legislative Caucus' fullest support to assist the task force to increase response to all affected communities in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the County Leadership is working to procure an ambulance to boost the capacity of the task force in response to the Ebola situation in the county. Senator Yallah appealed to the citizens to listen to health workers and follow the preventative measures in the fight against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bong County Caucus Chair provided 35 bags of 25kg rice and several hand washing buckets to the residents as his own way of identifying with them in the fight against the epidemic. It can be recalled Senator Yallah last month provided over 35 bags of 25kg rice, cooking utensils, several washing hand buckets and disinfectants for residents of Balakerthela in Salala District and Civil Compound and Millionaire Quarter communities in Jorquelleh Distract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia and countries under siege by the deadly Ebola virus have got yet good news. When the virus first struck, its maiden strategy was to target health workers apparently endeavoring send the health sectors of the affected countries in disarray before preying on the unprotected populations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the rallying cries have been the lack of personal protective equipment, logistics and manpower--all of which called for massive cash and material infusion. The world is hearing the pleas of West Africa, and one country that is not ignoring at all is India, which has pronounced the donation of US$12m to the United Nations to fighting the deadly virus. At home in Liberia, meanwhile, the Indian community continues its handsome contributions, as The Analyst reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India on Thursday announced $12 million contribution to the United Nations to help it fight the deadly Ebola virus in the African continent. The Times Newspaper of India reported yesterday, September 25, 2014, that the contribution was approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi just ahead of his departure to the US where he will address the 69th session of UN general assembly in New York on September 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;India to contribute $10 million to UN Secretary General's fund for Ebola. An additional $2 million for purchase of protective gear to tackle Ebola,&quot; External affairs ministry spokesperson said here. Ebola virus hits the African continent earlier this year and has killed nearly 2,200 people in several countries there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Security Council has also declared the outbreak of the virus in West Africa a &quot;threat to international peace and security&quot;. UN chief Ban Ki-moon last week had described the situation arising out of the spread of Ebola virus in the African continent as &quot;unprecedented&quot; and had announced setting up of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response to put in place an effective response mechanism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has warned the rest of the world not to &quot;stand back&quot; and expect America to combat the spread of the Ebola virus on its own, saying a slow international response could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a special high-level meeting on Ebola at the UN, Obama said that there had been progress in efforts to slow the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, but he added: &quot;We need to be honest with ourselves. We're not moving fast enough . . . There's still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international response had to be &quot;like a marathon, but run at the pace of a sprint&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's only possible if every nation and every organisation does its part. And everyone has to do more . . . Right now everybody has the best intentions, but people are not putting in the resources that are necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama departed from his prepared text to express frustration at the reticence of other countries in offering concrete assistance, suggesting that they were taking US intervention for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we move fast it could be the difference between 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands or a million. This should not be about wrangling and waiting to see who will give what first,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Do not stand by thinking somehow because of what we've done it's taken care of. It's not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has sent 40 humanitarian workers and soldiers to Sierra Leone to help build an emergency medical response centre. Britain's international development secretary, Justine Greening, said her country's contribution would triple the number of beds available for victims of the disease, but she said Sierra Leone still needed urgent help from other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his UN speech, Obama listed the emergency measures taken by his country. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is mounting the largest international response in its history, he said. The advance command post has been established in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, for a contingent of 3,000 US troops to help with medical logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US air force is also setting up an &quot;air bridge&quot; from Senegal to the three most affected countries, to keep up a constant flow of medical workers, equipment and supplies into the region. And Obama said the US public health department is setting up a hospital and field treatment centres across the three most affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same meeting, the leaders of the three countries at the centre of the epidemic appealed for more help and criticised international airlines for stopping flights to their capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said her country was being &quot;ostracised&quot; at a time when it was facing its greatest challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from Monrovia by video link, she said her country's deep tradition of extended families was making it harder to combat the spread of the disease. Families refused to leave the bedside of dying mothers or children, exposing themselves to infection, and could not accept that their sick children should be taken away by strangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Johnson Sirleaf said: &quot;We are fighting back,&quot; adding that foreign assistance had begun to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sierra Leonian president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said by videolink from his office in Freetown: &quot;Several months down the line, the international community is finally coming around to the better view that the Ebola outbreak is a challenge for everyone. Sierra Leone and its sister republics may be at the frontlines of this fight, but we require the heavy aerial and ground support of the world to defeat a disease worse than terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Forsyth, CEO of Save the Children, told the UN meeting: &quot;There is only a few weeks to act if we are to prevent this crisis spiralling out of control. We need a unified plan and much tighter coordination between all actors to recruit and support frontline health workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sierra Leonian government has quarantined more than 1 million people in an attempt to bring an end to the spread of the virus. Areas in the east of the country on the border of Guinea have been under quarantine for months, but travel is now restricted in three more areas where an estimated 1.5 million people live. Nearly a third of the country's population across 14 districts is now under curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address to the nation, Koroma said the weekend's lockdown had &quot;met its objectives&quot;, but had also exposed the challenges posed by the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to announcing the new isolation districts, the government is establishing corridors for travel between non-quarantined districts, with a curfew on all travel outside the hours of 9am and 5pm. Koroma said the isolation would &quot;definitely pose great difficulties for our people in these districts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama told delegates that a more rapid response could make the difference between tens of thousands of Ebola deaths 'and a million'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Jenkins is absolutely right to underline the fundamental difference between humanitarian and political or military intervention (Finally, the west is acting on Ebola. What took us so long?, 19 September). It is also true that humanitarian relief work currently faces unprecedented challenges, often as a result of being seen as linked to one side or another in conflict and other disasters. But it does not follow from this that the humanitarian ethic of the Red Cross has diminished, nor that the impartiality of our founders has been &quot;swamped in the rush to war&quot;. Whether in Syria or Sierra Leone, the Red Cross Red Crescent movement can and does deliver vital assistance every day without political, military or religious influence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been responding to the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since its very beginning and now have 2,500 volunteers working to prevent its spread across the three countries. They are part of a worldwide movement which delivers aid on the basis of greatest need. This often involves considerable danger, manifested tragically in Syria in the deaths of 37 Syrian Arab Red Crescent workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest threat to our humanitarian mission is being perceived as anything less than neutral, independent and impartial, which can lead to being unable to safely access those in need. This is why in conflict situations we make repeated calls for all parties to ensure quick and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid workers. The decision to provide humanitarian assistance must be driven by need only and regardless of &quot;national security&quot;. For this reason, it is imperative that the concept of humanitarianism is understood correctly.</SPAN></P>

Over the past 50 years Cuba has sent more than 300,000 health workers to 158 countries, even offering humanitarian aid to the US - which has tried to bring Cuba to its knees over the past 55 years by its illegal trade blockade - when hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. Simon Jenkins, to his credit, made a passing reference to Cuba's initiative in his column, but, apart from that, Cuba's medical volunteers seem to be totally invisible to our media.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 140 heads of state and government flew into New York this week for the United Nations general assembly amid apprehension that international order is unravelling at an accelerating pace, while the world's leaders seem ever less willing or able to deal with the proliferating threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's humanitarian agencies are in danger of being completely overwhelmed by the multiple crises. Ebola is spreading rapidly across west Africa, swamping rickety national health systems and a thus-far underfunded UN effort to stop its advance. The spread of Islamic State (Isis) extremists in the Middle East, feeding on the destruction brought about by the Syrian civil war and exposing the weakness of the Iraqi state, has similarly outpaced patchy international efforts at containment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New conflicts have flared while the old ones have burned on in the absence of concerted effort to quench the flames. Much of Gaza lies in ruins and there is no longer even a pretence at reviving Israel-Palestinian peace talks. Meanwhile, war has returned to the edges of Europe, with the dismemberment of Ukraine. The conflicts in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, which seemed among the world's most pressing concerns at the start of the year, continue to inflict enormous human cost yet were likely to draw scant attention at the world's talking shop this week, distracted by so many fresh disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon summed up the mood of foreboding hanging over the UN headquarters in Manhattan, saying the world was &quot;living in an era of unprecedented level of crises&quot;. The degree of deadlock among the traditional world powers is probably not unprecedented given the poor record of statesmanship displayed over the decades at the UN, but the zero-sum atmosphere in relations between Russia and the west is at a nadir not witnessed since the cold war. Russia's annexation of Crimea represented a direct challenge by a permanent member of the security council to core UN principles underpinning international security. And the bitterness surrounding Ukraine, compounding already deep divisions over Syria, has seeped into security council discussions on a host of other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN is grappling with crises on every level and Ukraine is poisoning the organisation from the head down,&quot; said Richard Gowan, at the Centre on International Cooperation at New York University. &quot;It does feel like a particularly dreadful year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one exception to the confrontational climate at the security council this year has been its deliberations on fighting the Ebola virus. Before the leaders even arrived, the council made history at ambassadorial level last Thursday, passing a resolution declaring Ebola a threat to international peace and security, calling on countries to send medical workers and supplies to combat it. The UN established an emergency mission to contain the spread of the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Ban was due to chair a further summit meeting on implementing the resolution this week. &quot;Ebola represents an opportunity for the UN in a way,&quot; Gowan said. &quot;It is one of those crises in which there are no conflicting interests. There is no pro-Ebola faction. And dealing with it involves using all parts of the UN system. It's a classic international problem requiring a common response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban is seeking a similarly common response to another longstanding and growing international challenge - climate change, but with significantly less success. The general debate began a day later than usual this year, on Wednesday, so that the world's leaders could attend a global summit on the issue on Tuesday. But the leaders of the world's three biggest countries, Russia, India and China, did not attend, claiming other commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Syria, the task of building a political and military coalition against Isis has been done outside the framework of the UN. A security council meeting did not address the role in the conflict of the Assad regime in Damascus, which - despite Isis's brutality - is still responsible for far more civilian deaths, according to Human Rights Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama was due to chair a security council summit session on Syria, but would address only the Isis threat and common ways of stopping the flow of foreign fighters to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflict, on which there is at least agreement in the council on principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one chink of light on the international scene from last year's general assembly also seems less bright 12 months on. The last-minute mobile phone conversation in 2013 between President Obama and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, as the latter drove to the airport, boosted hopes of a historic thaw in relations between the two countries. It helped create conditions for a breakthrough interim deal in November on Iran's nuclear programme, freezing it in place and partly reversing some elements in return for a slight relaxation in western sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, progress towards a more comprehensive agreement has been faltering. International talks due to conclude next July have been given a six-month extension, but optimism around the negotiations is fading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even optimists recognise that the prospects are dimming for a comprehensive nuclear deal between Iran and the west,&quot; Trita Parsi, the head of the National Iranian American Council, warned in a commentary for Foreign Policy magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rouhani's conservative opponents fear that a nuclear deal will pave the way for a major shift in Iran's foreign policy orientation and further push the conservatives away from Iran's centres of power,&quot; Parsi argued. He added: &quot;Simply put, Iran can afford to say no to a deal that doesn't meet its bottom-line requirements.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 6 million residents in Sierra Leone hunkered down at home last weekend as the country saw a three-day lockdown aimed at raising awareness about the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The normally crowded streets were empty in the hilly capital, Freetown, with only security officials and essential workers with government passes allowed out. &quot;Freetown is looking very lonely. We are all just staying at home waiting,&quot; said taxi driver Salifu Conte last Friday as the curfew began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Gaojia, head of the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), which leads the national Ebola response, told Reuters that 92 bodies had been recovered across the country by the end of Saturday, the second day of the lockdown, and 123 people had contacted the authorities, believing they might be infected. Of these, 56 had tested positive for Ebola, 31 tested negative and 36 were awaiting their results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dramatic measures came as the United Nations said the outbreak, which has infected some 5,300 people largely in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, was a threat to world peace. Health workers have struggled to stem the spiralling numbers as residents in rural areas have fled or attacked them. Last Thursday nine members of an education team in Guinea were found with slit throats after panicked residents thought they had come to attack them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 30,000 volunteers have been trained to hand out soap and raise awareness in the campaign known locally as &quot;hose to hose tok&quot; (house-to-house talk), but there were delays across the capital. &quot;We volunteers have been waiting since 7am, but the health officials haven't come yet. We're ready to go, we want this Ebola to end, but the planning has not been the best,&quot; said Ade Kamara in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone's president said if the population heeded the volunteers' advice it would &quot;help to reverse the increasing trend of the disease transmission and become a very big boost to our collective effort to stop the outbreak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message broadcast on television and radio, Ernest Bai Koroma said: &quot;These are extraordinary times and extraordinary times require extraordinary measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others echoed that message. &quot;This is an opportunity to hear from families what they want to know about Ebola,&quot; said Roeland Monasch, head of Unicef, which has helped train volunteers. &quot;If people don't have access to the right information, we need to bring life-saving messages to them, where they live, at their doorsteps. The fight against Ebola needs to happen in every household, in every community and in every treatment centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some health organisations worried the lockdown could drive already panicked communities into further isolation. Medecins sans Frontieres also expressed concerns about where potential new cases would be treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're quite worried about the management of this campaign. Every single treatment centre in the country is full,&quot; said Christina Falconi, country coordinator for Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials said they had expected to discover as many as 20% more new patients, who would then be taken to hospitals. &quot;There is a quite rigorous testing process before you can confirm the cases, and many of the early symptoms are the same as ordinary illnesses like malaria or food poisoning,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EOC announced that it would not extend the campaign in order to reach remaining households as it had earlier said might be required. &quot;It cannot be extended because its objectives have largely been met,&quot; Gaojia said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents largely complied with the lockdown, but a team burying Ebola victims was attacked in Freetown last Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Koiwood said the loan program will jump start this week. He was spoke Sunday went he donated fifty buckets, twenty cartoons of dusty soap packets with some anti Ebola items valued hundreds of United State Dollars to residents of Gungbeyah Chiefdom , Gokala Community in Gbarpolu County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The representative further disclosed that the loan provided by his office is intended to help citizens purchase materials for their homes and reduce the movement of people to avoid contracting the Ebola virus. According to him, such loan will be paid through installments whenever government settles the salaries of civil servants living in Gbarpolu County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gbarpolu County District #1 lawmaker warned that tough actions will be taken against any beneficiaries of the loan program found plying the streets of Monrovia and its environs in search of their basis needs. Rep. Koiwood also warned citizens against the eating of bush meats and bathing dead bodies, suspecting that some people across the county are still selling bush meats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He clarified that he saw some people in Gbarngay Town located in Bopolu County selling bush meats pretending to be a cool water fish, noting that if Liberians continue eating bush meats and bathing dead bodies, the Ebola pandemic could wept out the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Representative Koiwood wants the Government to provide compensation for people that are volunteering in the fight against the incurable Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Declaring the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa to be beyond regional threat, Chinese Ambassador to Liberia, Zhang Yue, says with both preventive and medical efforts, the transmission chain of the deadly virus will be broken and the Ebola virus disease will be defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Zhang Spoke on Wednesday at the signing ceremony of the exchange of letters on the new assistance package the People's Republic of China has planned to give to Liberia to enhance the anti-Ebola campaign. The ceremony was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ambassador Yue also disclosed that the escalation of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa has posed grave challenges not only to the countries in the region but also to the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Learning from our experience in fighting against the SARS epidemic in China in 2003, we believe that it is crucial to take urgent measures to improve the public health system, and on the other hand, it is equally important to raise the prevention consciousness of all people of the Nation. With both preventive and medical efforts, we shall break the transmission chain of Ebola virus disease&quot; Ambassador Zhang Yue explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said with huge financial resources provided by his country and other partners, more health workers can be hired and more human resources can be mobilized to go to the local communities to raise public awareness about the right way of self-protection and prevention. The Ebola crisis, he said, does not only threaten people's lives, it also has great impact on economic development and social stability of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He registered Chinese President Xi Jinping's high concern about the outbreak of the Ebola pandemic in Liberia and the region in general and care for the friends in the Ebola affected countries. The Chinese Ambassador said during the state visit of President Xi Jinping to India on September 18, he announced that the Chinese government decides to provide 200 million RMB Yuan (about 33 million US dollars) worth of the new round of emergency assistance to 10 affected regional countries, in addition to two previous batches of assistance given by his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, the Chinese envoy said the new batch of Chinese assistance will provide one million US dollars in financial aid and two million US dollars' worth of food assistance to Liberia. He disclosed that the government of the People's Republic of China will also provide two million US dollars each to the World Health Organization (WHO) and African Unity (AU) in support of their fight against the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Ambassador, the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese companies in Liberia have been engaged in, supporting some Liberia government agencies, NGOs and communities fight against the Ebola virus by donating disinfection and preventive materials as well as encouraging some NGOs to take the Ebola awareness campaign in local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, the government of China also decides to donate 1.3 million RMB Yuan (about 200 thousand US dollars) worth of equipment including 2 SUVs and 30 motorcyclists to the Liberia National Police to enhance its capacity in combating the Ebola pandemic as well as to improve its mobility in the context of UNMIL's drawdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said their food assistance and aid to the LNP are aiming at the improvement of the severe situation which will be implemented through the World Food Program (WFP). While the Chinese government and people highly appreciate the untiring efforts by relevant countries to combat the deadly Ebola epidemic, China has been responding positively and quickly to the calls from the region to give a helping hand to the people in need.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Monday to media practitioners at the National Police Headquarters on the Capitol Bye-Pass, Inspector Sarr said any motorcyclists caught plying the main street irregularly will be penalized by police authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said before the outbreak of Ebola in Liberia, the government instituted a policy that regulates the movement of motorcyclists in the country which includes reduction of passengers from two to one, which according to him the cyclists are still violating, taking advantage of the transportation difficulties faced in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Inspector Saar, hundreds of motorcycles have been arrested and will not be returned to their owners no matter the status, position or whatever. The inspector strongly warned the cyclists to be running transport in the communities instead of the main using the streets to avoid further embarrassment from the Liberia National Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said any motorcyclist who refuses to heed the Police directive when stopped will have himself or herself blamed as the police will go after such cyclist. Inspector Saar also warned taxi drivers and other public transport vehicles against carrying sick patients and dead bodies to Ebola or health centers. He said such practice by commercial vehicles has the propensity to continuously spread the Ebola virus among citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any taxi driver or other cars that are not authorized by the government to pick up sick person or dead body and is caught doing so will be arrested&quot; further warned. He urges the Ebola task force to quickly respond to calls from the communities and pick up sick patients and dead bodies to avoid non-ambulance vehicles taking the responsibility.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maryland County Representative was particularly referencing Representatives and Senators who he said have chosen to undermine themselves from performing their oversight responsibilities by choosing to accept executive appointment to serve on the National Ebola task force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Edwin Snowe among other lawmakers have been appointed to serve on the National Ebola task force, which is headed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf herself. Dr. Chambers noted that the presence of the legislators on the task force does not only undermine their oversight role as lawmakers, it also embarrasses the function of the Legislature as their absence may affect quorum of a day's legislative business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, Dr. Chamber said it also embarrasses the openness of the Legislature in its dealings without matters brought before the lawmakers by the task force during the health emergency imposed by the government, saying the presence of some key members of the House of Representatives and the senate on the task force was not healthy for the oversight responsibility of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Chambers wondered why lawmakers on the National Ebola task force who has oversight responsibilities will be selected or appointed to serve in positions under the executive branch in the running of the government. Recently the National Ebola task force headed by the President herself submitted a report characterizing budgetary allotments of the task force which informed the legislature that every government agency that has received funding to fight Ebola will be responsible in accounting for the money they received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During debate concerning President Sirleaf's letter to the House on behalf of the National Ebola task force, Dr. Chambers requested that the Chairman of the Ebola task force should be allowed to appear before that body to give full detail of the money the task force has used for the sake of transparency in the operations of the task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was the rights of Liberians to keep engaging their lawmakers to be more opened in their operations and works if they are to achieve the core values attached to openness, democracy, accountability, transparency among others, thereby departing from that ancient and practical African style and concept of leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the importance of voting in the works of the legislature. Apparently, the representative was saying how the absence of the legislators from session as a result of their presence on the task force was a misrepresentation of their constituents in taking legislative decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that votes are documented in parliament so as to have a clear understanding of which lawmaker voted for or against a decision in a session. This, he pointed out, constitutes a departure from too much of executive or secret sessions, stressing: &quot;Voting and debating issues in open session support modern democratic practices, if the ordinary people are to form part of debates arising from the floor in the National Legislature&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maryland County lawmaker indicated that it is further good for Liberia's emerging democracy if the government should strive to maintain those virtues that are not limited to equal opportunity, social equality, economic justice, public trust and the protection of the rights and liberties of all persons. To improve on the openness of the legislature, he said it was the constitutional responsibility of citizens to hold accountable their lawmakers to do the right things or have them recalled if they failed to work in the people's interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, most contemporary democracies, if not all, make open parliament as a trend of governance,&quot; the representative said. According to him, &quot;open parliament is building trust and confidence in the citizens for their leaders, especially those who should serve various interests in legislatures, assemblies, congress or parliaments globally&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, it was announced that 400 staff working in the NHS have answered an appeal to travel to Sierra Leone to fight Ebola. I am one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This outbreak, which started last December, has already claimed more than 2,600 lives. On Tuesday the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that the number of cases could reach hundreds of thousands by January. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US claim that, at worst, Ebola could become endemic in Africa, with 1.4 million cases by the start of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The urgency of the situation is why health professionals across the world are coming together to support communities in West Africa that are in desperate need of their knowledge and expertise. Britain is just a part of the international response to Ebola, but as a country we can be so proud of those who have stepped forward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UK appeal is being coordinated by Save the Children, the Departments for Health and International Development, and the charity UK-Med, which hosts the UK International Emergency Medical Response Register through which NHS workers are applying to volunteer. British Armed Forces are already in the country constructing an Ebola treatment unit. Those who have come forward are of all ages and skills: some will have been deployed abroad before; for many it will be the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am 34 and an emergency medical clinician. I work part-time at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and as a clinical lecturer in emergency response at the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute at the University of Manchester. I've been involved with humanitarian work for the past six years. I love the challenge it presents and the privilege of engaging with different communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you decide to work in a disaster area it is hard on your loved ones. My mother and father are retired, and it is difficult for them, even if they understand my passion for such work. That said, if my personal situation changed and I was married or had children, things might be different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will be deployed over the coming months after extensive training in the UK and then in Sierra Leone when we arrive. Each volunteer will get a full personal protection suit: zipped up hood, goggles or face shield, mask, double gloves, an apron and covering for our boots. It will be very hot, and very demanding in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course we will be apprehensive, and it is always a shock when you are first confronted with the devastation. The spread of the virus has been catastrophic and this week WHO revised its estimated mortality rate for Ebola from 50 per cent to 70 per cent - adding further to the fear that already grips communities where outbreaks occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will be subjected to sights unlike anything we've encountered back home. Last year, I worked for two weeks in the Philippines as part of the relief effort following Typhoon Haiyan. Prior to that, I spent seven months in Sri Lanka working with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res. I have learnt from those deployments how to develop a level of resilience to help manage things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I was in Sri Lanka I wrote a lot of emails to myself about my experiences. Writing, I found, is wonderfully cathartic. I haven't read them back but I might have a look before I go to West Africa to remind myself of the challenges I may be facing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other way of coping is to talk to those who have experienced the situation. One of the biggest challenges volunteers encounter is returning home and trying to explain to family and friends what they have seen and done. It will be vital to ensure there is effective debriefing for returning team members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In West Africa we will be on the front line, but wellrehearsed in how to reduce the risk of transmission with strict clinical protocols in place. It is all about understanding the Ebola virus, the community infrastructure and the culture and context in which we are working and collaborating with local and international teams already on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a real passion among NHS staff to make a contribution. Those that aren't able to deploy abroad are covering shifts at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I take heart from the selflessness of William Pooley, the British nurse who recovered from Ebola, and who this week flew to the US to give blood to help save another doctor's life. Both of them contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone. It is hoped the antibodies in Mr Pooley's blood will help the American victim fight off the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is that kind of spirit that is uniting the international community in an effort to halt the spread of this terrible disease in West Africa. As volunteers, we will be doing everything we can to help.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIKE every other volunteer who serves with Medecins Sans Frontieres, Stefan Liljegren joined up to help the sick and destitute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 15 years with the agency, he has been everywhere from Afghanistan and Kosovo through to South Sudan and East Timor, the hard and often dangerous work compensated for by the knowledge that he is saving lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As field coordinator of MSF's new 160-bed Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, one of his tasks is to decide which of the sick people who arrive outside the clinic's gates should get treatment. Such is the scale of the outbreak that for every 20 to 30 new patients the clinic admits each day, the same number are often turned away - despite the likelihood that they will go home and infect their relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is by far the most difficult challenge that I have ever faced,&quot; the 44-yearold Swede said. &quot;Every day I have been faced with impossible choices, and decisions that are inhuman to make. Having to tell someone that they can't come in when they are screaming and begging to do so is an indescribable feeling, especially when you know they may go back to families who might well then get sick themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the clinic an hour earlier, a grisly scene demonstrated Mr Liljegren's point. Resting face down in the mud, an arm crooked over his face, was the body of Dauda Konneh, 42. He had been lying there dead since daybreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was vomiting a lot and had symptoms like Ebola, so we put him in a pickup truck and took him here for treatment,&quot; said one young man outside. &quot;When we got here last night, he was still alive, but the clinic would not accept him. He died at dawn today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having dead or dying patients outside the clinic overnight is &quot;a regular occurrence,&quot; he says. Once night falls, the hospital does not admit anyone: handling Ebola patients would be too dangerous in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of removing Mr Konneh's body falls to Stephen Rowden, a volunteer from Danbury, Essex. &quot;When I started it was maybe a body every two days, now it is daily and sometimes up to five a day,&quot; said Mr Rowden, 55. &quot;I have never seen this amount of bodies before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clinic, one of three operating in Monrovia, has seen 350 deaths in the past month alone. Since all infected bodies have to be burned, the casualties have exceeded the capacity of Monrovia's crematorium. MSF has had to import an incinerator from Europe - normally used for livestock. For an aid agency that prides itself on triumphing in even the most dif-ficult circumstances, it is a depressing reminder of how far there is to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges facing the MSF clinic are a snapshot of the wider outbreak engulfing West Africa. On Tuesday, a World Health Organisation study warned that the number of Ebola cases, currently topping 5,000, could reach hundreds of thousands by January unless the aid operation was drastically increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Liberia, where 40 per cent of the deaths have taken place, and where the government health service has been paralysed by Ebola infections among its own staff. In coming weeks, a 3,000-strong US military mission will arrive in Monrovia to build 17 more Ebola treatment clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the MSF clinic, those patients fortunate enough to get through the gates are admitted to rows of large white treatment tents. One patient, Foofee Sheriff, 54, tells how he became infected after attending the funeral of his brother. &quot;We did not touch my brother's body during the burial, we used plastic bags on our hands to make sure that didn't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no telling how many more desperate people may soon be pleading at the gates. &quot;It gets worse by the day,&quot; Mr Liljegren said. &quot;How much worse it will it get? I have no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&THORN;Police in Guinea last night arrested 27 suspects over the murders of an eightmember Ebola education team attacked by angry locals in an area at the epicentre of the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims, said to include health offi-cials and journalists, were attacked during a visit in the town of Womey last week. Eight bodies were recovered from the septic tank of a primary school two days later, according to the government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Representatives have instructed its Chief Clerk Mildred Siryon to write President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, informing her that they have cast a vote of no confidence in two of her appointed officials from Nimba County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include Fong Zuagele, Superintendent and TeekoYorlay, Assistant Superintendent for Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers mandated the Chief Clerk to inform the President as part of coordination in government that they have come to the realization that they can no longer work with these two local county officials due to their persistent disrespectful actions shown toward the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision followed several hours of hearing Tuesday when Supt. Zuagele and his deputy appeared before Plenary to address themselves to series of allegations levied against them by the Nimba Legislative Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nimba caucus claimed that the local officials were bent on disrespecting them and misdirecting funds intended to fight the Ebola virus in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Nimba Legislative Caucus complained to Plenary to summon Supt. Zuagele and Assistant Supt. Yorlay to show cause why they cannot be held in contempt for being lord onto themselves in running the county's affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communication, the Caucus accused the two county officials of misdirecting US$100,000 intended for the county's Health Team to fight the Ebola Virus. The communication also said the local officials unilaterally suspended the chairman of the Project Management Committee (PMC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assigned vehicle to the PMC Chairman, according to the Caucus, has also been seized by Superintendent Zuagele without any reference to the County's Legislative Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caucus further said instead of the money be given directly to the County's Health Team, Superintendent Zuagele misdirected the money and diverted huge portion for himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Caucus, Supt Zuagele allegedly distributed the balance of the US$100,000 with commissioners, Paramount Chiefs and City Mayors who do not have medial experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the confirmation of Supt Zuagele, he has since become a 'self-styled' Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the county by unilaterally placing a hold on the county's account without any reference to the caucus, which has retarded all approved and ongoing projects,&quot; the Caucus claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, appearing before Plenary Tuesday, Supt. Zuagele and Deputy Teeko Yorlay admitted to suspending the PMC Chairman, even though they do not have such authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supt. Zuagele said their action to suspend the PMC Chairman was based on fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On issues of the US$100,000, Supt Zuagele denied misdirecting the money and said the disbursement was made with the knowledge of the County's Health Team, contrary to the Nimba Lawmakers' claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Senators acknowledging an error in approving the fund without a detailed work plan at the time, they stressed the need for the Taskforce to submit a report within a week for perusal and subsequent audit by the General Auditing Commission (GAC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint communication by Senators Nyonblee Kanga-Lawrence, Geraldine Doe-Sheriff and Sando Johnson expressed disappointment over government's fight against the Ebola pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senators in their communication argued that there is no visible impact regarding the use of the money, citing shortage of medical supplies at referral hospitals, salaries for health workers and the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the increasing number of deaths and confirmed cases, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communication comes in the wake of a growing number of reported and recorded deaths to over 1,495 persons, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics issued Monday, September 22, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Sando Johnson told plenary that despite the approval of an initial US$5 million, people are still dying in their homes and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He complained about the ineffectiveness of the Ebola call center and said the shortage of ambulances to respond to suspected cases was worrying. &quot;What happen to the initial five million we approved for this Ebola fight; health workers are not paid, no ambulances and protective equipment and medical supplies, so where is the money or how was it used?&quot; Senator Johnson wondered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Bong County Senator Henry Yallah claimed that 13 persons have died from Ebola Virus Disease in Bong Mines. He told plenary that other suspected persons remained at large because they ran into nearby bushes.</SPAN></P>

Doe Sports Complex (SKD) is intended for the storage of logistics and not Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, there has been speculation in Monrovia that the SKD was amongst several sites identified by the government and partners for the construction of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a team of Liberia Media Center (LMC)/IREX supported journalists in Monrovia, Mr. Kenneth Blixt said constructions at the logistics hub are completely different from those carried out at places earmarked for use by the ETUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the hub will serve as a transit station for cargos and other logistics that will be brought by air and other ports for onward distribution to various ETUs and Ebola centers in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Blixt said the initial ten-unit tents will store logistics from all agencies and humanitarian organizations engaged in the ongoing Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP Program Manager said there are prospects for the construction of additional logistics and cargos hubs to serve the entire nation. The SKD Complex logistics hub, according to Blixt, is expected to be completed in a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, youth of District # 6 and resident of the SKD community said the community members welcome the construction of the logistics site in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince Peters said the community and the government agreed for the erection of logistics base and not Ebola Treatment Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peters said at least 36 young people are working at the logistics site and more jobs for young people are expected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team from the Louisiana State University has arrived in the country to hold a three-week intensive anti Ebola seminar for over five hundred officers of the Liberia National Police. The seminar, which is ongoing at the Headquarters of the Liberia National Police is made possible through the States Department, of the US Government to train first respondents of the police to the Ebola crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three man team is headed by Jason Krause, Director of Operations National Center for Biomedical Research and Training based in the State of Louisiana, the United States of America. The team is specialized in Biological incidents, Food and Agriculture Incidents and Haznat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the opening of the Seminar the head of the Louisiana medical team Jason Krause, said the team is in the country to provide more practical training for selected officers of the Liberia National Police as they respond to the Ebola outbreak in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded that the training was significant for the officers and will further put them in a more suitable condition not to contract and spread the disease. The three weeks training will look at protective measures such as Wearing personal protective Equipment when in the vicinity of infected patients or potentially infected material or surfaces and will also focus on the &quot;DO NOT&quot; such as not to touch infected persons without proper PPE, and not handle tissues, bodily fluids, or clothing from infected person without proper protective Equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the Ebola the United States Government has made several gestures of anti-Ebola materials to the Liberia National Police, to include PPE, Chloride, and Chorine, Facemask, Eye Protection, Respiratory Protection, Gloves and hand sensitizer among others. Speaking on behalf of the LNP, the Director of Police for Administration Col. William K. Mulbah lauded the Government of the United States of America for the much assistance they have rendered the police in the midst of the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LNP Deputy Director said, the police was grateful for the numerous support it continues to get from the Americans, directed towards re- building the capacity of the police and promised that with such knowledge the LNP was prepared to increase its fight against the spread of the virus. He cautioned officers attending the training program to take it seriously while they are actively engaged with the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers attending the seminar are drawn from the Crime Services Division, Patrol, Police Support Unit, ERU, Traffic etc. The Liberia National Police have been seriously involved with the fight against the spread of EVD since its outbreak by the deploying officers to key medical instillations around the country. The police involvement has also covered the escorting of health workers and body removal teams into various communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the Liberia National Police launched a massive &quot;Ebola Awareness Campaign&quot; in Dolo Town Margibi County, where several items were donated to the residents during their time of quarantined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much-criticized quarantine of the slum community of West Point did not end on a good note as was predicted by the critics. Though the quarantine did not last long perhaps due to incessant public and experts' urge, it left one resident, a teenager gunned down, and two others still nursing bullet wounds. Apparently to soothe bubbling public anxiety, President Sirleaf set up a board of inquiry to probe circumstances leading to the shooting incident. The report is yet to reach the public glare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the President who received it has turned to the authors, authority of the Armed Forces of Liberia whose agents were involved in the West Point melee, to take appropriate actions against individuals named as culprits and to heed the recommendations of the report. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and President of Liberia, Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has authorized AFL Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Daniel D. Ziankahn, to take immediate action in line with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) against those found culpable in keeping with the recommendations of the Report, writes Bill K.Jarkloh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf who said the action underlines her determination to ensure that the Liberian Military remains responsible and accountable for its action at all times, also requested the Independent Human Rights Commission to carry out an investigation into the occurrences in the West Point Community on August 20, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the Commission's probe into the matter would allow for frank exchanges between the citizens and the Commission, thereby assuring our people that their views and recommendations will be given consideration in the final conclusion of this very sad chapter in our nation's history. President Sirleaf made the statement when she received from the &quot;Board of Inquiry&quot; report on the West Point Incident of August 20, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extending thanks to all members of the Board of Inquiry who have reviewed and given the utmost importance to the recommendations, the president indicated that in the attempt by the government to protect the people in the West Point Community from the Ebola virus disease, authorized that the Community be quarantined by personnel of the security forces from August 19, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this process, an unfortunate incident occurred on August 20, 2014 involving some residents of the West Point Community and security personnel of the Joint Task Force (JTF),&quot; the President recalled. She said little Shiaka Kamara was shot and subsequently lost his life in the confusion that resulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf considering the death of Little Kamara a sad and regrettable development, also noted that little Titus Nuah also was shot unfortunately and is being treated at a local hospital with assurance of his full recovery. &quot;As a government, we mourn with the family of little Shiaka Kamara and extend our sympathy to those wounded as we look forward to their speedy recovery,&quot; the President added, saying, &quot;We are also duty bound to find out what really happened on that fateful day of August 20, 2014.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, the President authorized the setting up of a Board of Inquiry which was comprised of representatives from the Liberia National Police, the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, the National Security Agency, the National Fire Service and the Armed Forces of Liberia. In addition, there were Observers in the persons of two U.S. Military Advisors and one ECOWAS Military Advisor, President Sirleaf explained, saying that the Board of Inquiry has completed its work and its report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, it was reported by this paper that a preliminary report has been released by the Board of Inquiry into the fatal killing of little Shaki Kamara as a result of an alleged shooting by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) who were deployed in West Point to quarantine the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Analyst quoted Information Minister Lewis G. Brown, who made the disclosure during the regular Ebola briefing at the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism. Minister Brown informed journalists that the report has been forwarded to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for her perusals. The Information Minister said at the time that the report was been received by the Minister of Defense on Monday, September 15 and immediately turned same over to the office of the President on Tuesday, September 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown further told the Journalists that he did not know the content of the report, but added that it contains appropriate recommendations that lay out the facts and circumstances which led to the shooting of a young Liberian who subsequently died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told a team of the journalists that the report establishes a number of recommendations; and that it is now in the office of the president for consideration taking for thoughtfulness all the details and the recommendations after which the office of the president promised act appropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our attempt as a government to protect our people in the West Point Community from the Ebola virus disease, I authorized that the Community be quarantined by personnel of the security forces from August 19, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this process, an unfortunate incident occurred on August 20, 2014 involving some residents of the West Point Community and security personnel of the Joint Task Force (JTF). In the confusion, one of our compatriots, little Shiaka Kamara was shot and subsequently lost his life.This is a sad and regrettable development. Unfortunately, little Titus Nuah also was shot and is being treated at a local hospital with assurance of his full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a government, we mourn with the family of little Shiaka Kamara and extend our sympathy to those wounded as we look forward to their speedy recovery. We are also duty bound to find out what really happened on that fateful day of August 20, 2014.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More Liberians will walk out of treatment centers alive because doctors are dedicating more efforts and are now gaining momentum to fearlessly battle the deadly Ebola disease,&quot; Atai Omoruto, a Ugandan doctor, has said. Dr. Omoruto, who is a consultant for WHO Ebola Case Management at the Island Clinic in Monrovia, made the statement Tuesday when she addressed the Ministry of Information daily Ebola news briefing held in the conference hall of the ministry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said saving the lives of every Ebola patient who comes into treatment units remains her top priority. Dr. Omoruto said the Island Clinic facility is a major boost to Liberia's Ebola fight, but noted that additional treatment facilities need to be constructed so that patients can be accommodated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, early treatment is important to survive the Ebola disease, but called on the government to do more in passing on the information to people in communities so that they will come for treatment immediately upon suspecting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She observed that protracted period with the virus outside of treatment facilities is responsible for most of the deaths recorded because, according to Omoruto, many people wait until they are acutely ill before they are taken to treatment centers. &quot;If you walk into treatment centers, you will walk out healthy and safe, but when you come in lying on stretchers, there is very limited possibility to survive the virus,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. Omoruto has disclosed that Liberia is facing &quot;a very dangerous strain&quot; of the Ebola disease due to its vastness in replication. She noted that supportive treatment has proven effective against the virus and as such doctors are responding swiftly to provide intensive supportive care to patients which enable their recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the Ebola virus as an unknown &quot;enemy&quot; of Liberians at the Monrovia City Hall on Tuesday, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said she is inclined to hold responsible for the prevalence of the disease, those who continue to be in the state of denial and the habit of other traditional practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President who hailed the role of the Americans in savaging the infliction of the heavy death toll the deadly Ebola virus on the Liberia people noted that she was notwithstanding disturbed by the denial of some people, the level of fear, the hiding the sick people in communities and burying of dead people without the Ebola burial teams, saying that these practices have resulted to the danger the people face from the prevalence of the Ebola viral disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sirleaf who said her government is not taking lightly the need for more Ebola treatment centers noted that the US Government is coming into the picture with a very big plan to help the Liberian Government and people surmount the outbreak of the killer disease, the Ebola virus disease in the country, although she could not indicate what is contained in the package of the American government's plans to fight Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday to members of the Liberian Chapters of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, President Sirleaf said it's indeed her expectation that the US Government supports Liberia anti-Ebola drive in a very big way, stressing that Liberians need to develop a behavior change in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently President Sirleaf is expressing no surprise at the level of assistance the United States have been given Liberia in the fight against the deadly virus. Already, the United States besides the cash value that has been directly and indirectly committed to the country in the wake of the Ebola outbreak in the country, the Barrack Obama administration has committed to moving a US- AFRICOM based in Monrovia with some 3,000 marine experts that are to station in the country to help in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the American government's center for disease control and prevention has seconded a team of experts to the country that has been engaged in the national anti-Ebola fight spearheaded by a National Anti-Ebola Taskforce chaired by the President herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said there is some progress being made in the areas of awareness, but cautioned that success in the fight against the deadly virus could be achieved rapidly when Liberians move away from the state of denial, and practices of cultural and traditional beliefs that were still prevalent among the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President indicated that there is sufficient propagation of Ebola awareness campaigns into communities, but people are still engaged into denial, fear, hiding the sick people and burying dead bodies and other beliefs that are continue to backtrack the anti-Ebola fight. She expressed the hope that people will accept behavior change so as to eradicate the disease in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, she said citizens in communities need to take ownership of the fight against the virus as the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority along with other organizations have now begun to get involved in the fight against the virus. These organizations, the President, said are considering the empowerment and participation of community dwellers on the grassroots level so as to ensure outreach at every sector in the fight against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf thanked members of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority for bracing the courage to seek support from members and partners abroad in the fight against the Ebola virus in Liberia. She called on other Liberian-based organizations with international links to engage their partners in the wake of the disease outbreak to help Liberia have a crossover in the ongoing fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our attempt as a government to protect our people in the West Point Community from the Ebola virus disease, I authorized that the Community be quarantined by personnel of the security forces from August 19, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this process, an unfortunate incident occurred on August 20, 2014 involving some residents of the West Point Community and security personnel of the Joint Task Force (JTF). In the confusion, one of our compatriots, little Shiaka Kamara was shot and subsequently lost his life.This is a sad and regrettable development. Unfortunately, little Titus Nuah also was shot and is being treated at a local hospital with assurance of his full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a government, we mourn with the family of little Shiaka Kamara and extend our sympathy to those wounded as we look forward to their speedy recovery. We are also duty bound to find out what really happened on that fateful day of August 20, 2014. Against this background, I authorized the setting up of a Board of Inquiry which was comprised of representatives from the Liberia National Police, the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, the National Security Agency, the National Fire Service and the Armed Forces of Liberia. In addition, there were Observers in the persons of two U.S. Military Advisors and one ECOWAS Military Advisor. The Board of Inquiry has completed its work and its report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I extend thanks to all the members of the Board of Inquiry and have reviewed and given the utmost importance to the recommendations. Accordingly, I am authorizing the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia, Brigadier General Daniel D. Ziankahn, to take immediate action in line with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) against those found culpable in keeping with the recommendations of the Report. This action underlines my determination to ensure that our Military remains responsible and accountable for its action at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have also requested the Independent Human Rights Commission to carry out an investigation into the occurrences in the West Point Community on August 20, 2014. This would allow for frank exchanges between the citizens and the Commission, thereby assuring our people that their views and recommendations will be given consideration in the final conclusion of this very sad chapter in our nation's history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">774 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia has welcomed the predictive tool released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC). This instrument is intended to help measure our progress in the ongoing fight against the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a MICAT Release, the Ebola Response Model predicts what could happen if we do nothing, and importantly, how, overtime, we can measure positive changes in the state of the Ebola fight by taking good public health actions, such as those described in the National Ebola Response Plan of the Government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting the CDC publication, the MICAT release added that the published estimates of the CDC are based on data only up to August 28, and assumes that both the Government and the international community will do nothing more than had been done up to that date. Information Minister Lewis Brown disclosed that understanding the range between the potential worst outcome and the best outcome gives the government and its partners more information about the steps we need to take to win this fight in the shortest possible time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The information in this report will help the government and its partners not only in terms of focusing on the ongoing fight, but also in making the case internationally for greater and more urgent support to fight the worst Ebola epidemic in history. We intend to use this tool of the CDC to continuously measure our collective efforts and progress&quot;, the MICAT Boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing to the fact that the estimates of the CDC are based on data collected more than three weeks ago, the Chief Spokesman of the Liberian Government reminded that steps have already been taken since the end of August not to realize the worst-case predicted outcomes in the report. The Minister named such steps to include the addition of beds in Ebola Treatment Units at ELWA II and the JFK since the end of August, the conversion of Redemption Hospital into a 105-bed Holding Center, as well as the newly-opened150-bed Unit at the Island Clinic which will positively affect the predicted estimates were these to be included in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other actions of the Government and partners, according to Minister Brown which will positively affect the current predictions when added include the fact that bodies are more rapidly removed than 2 weeks ago because of the increase and zonal locations of burial teams, as well as the training of hundreds of community health volunteers including teachers to help our people take steps to protect their health. Minister Brown disclosed that these trainings and mobilization of communities are ongoing and will continue across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Liberian Information Minister, the Liberian Government is working with the CDC to add these and other important information about progress into the Ebola Response Model. &quot;By entering those facts, we will be able to get a full picture, as well as update the estimate regularly so as to reflect the expected effect of public health actions taken by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and its partners in the ongoing fight. As soon as we add that information to the prediction tool, the updated projections will be shared&quot;, Minister Brown disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the predictive model of the CDC has revealed that people who are in Ebola Treatment Units OR who are kept in their own areas, away from others and at home while new units are being built infect less than one person on the average. People who are not separated from others while they are sick, risk infecting about 2 other persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Minister Brown, this finding further confirms the urgent need to keep sick people away from those who are not sick, saying, &quot;This continues to be one of the most important steps we can take to win this fight. If people have a sick person at home, they need to find a way to keep that person in their own place, away from others, so as to protect the rest of the family, and other people who may be living in the same house, until the health team arrives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Information Minister reminded Liberians that ending this Ebola epidemic will take some time. He, however, revealed that the Liberian Government and its partners are adding Ebola Treatment Units and taking all necessary measures, including programs of community ownership to shorten the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the CDC Report, the MICAT Boss observed that the predictive model proves that once a Tipping Point is reached, cases will decline about as rapidly as they have increased noting that &quot;gains below the tipping point can also significantly reduce cases.&quot; Working together, we will defeat Ebola, the MICAT release concluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zorzor District Development Caucus headed by Cllr J. Laveli Supuwood and other executive members have been informed of unhealthy behavior of some officers of the Bureau of Immigration &amp; Naturalization assigned at the Yeala and Kpassagizia Border posts who are reportedly allowing Ebola cases from Guinea into Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration &amp; Naturalization, Col. Lemuel Reeves, the Zorzor District Development Caucus told the BIN boss that despite the State of Emergency in the country and the subsequent closure of the borders of Liberia, the Immigration Commander at the Yeala Boarder Point, Othello Dennis and another only identified as officer Jones have allowed Ebola carriers to enter the country from Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caucus told the Immigration Commissioner in the letter dated September 17, 2014 and signed by the Caucus's Secretary-General Chief Eugene Flomo and approved by the group's Vice President Atty. Prof. Laveli B. Kortimai, Sr., and attested by Cllr. J. Laveli Supuwood that the presence of the Ebola carriers from Guinea in the area instigated protest action from the Youth of Yeala against the reopening of the border by the BIN officers and the joint security forces assigned in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter quoted Yeala Town Chief Rufus Sumo that two occupants of a car were tested at the Curran Hospital in Zorzor and found positive and were taken to Foyah last Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caucus indicated that immigration officers allowed cars similarly conveying Ebola affected persons from Guinea through the Kpassagizia Border, saying that the two persons allowed into the country through that entry point were confirmed positive by the Curran Lutheran Hospital and sent to Foyah on Friday night, September 14, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caucus also indicated in its letter that only one police officer is assigned to Yeala Border which is a very popular crossing point, wondering whether there is any at the Kpassagizia Border point. The Caucus is therefore calling for the transfer of the present BIN and joint security officers, some of whom are said to have spent five years at these points, for posing more danger to the locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The caucus indicated that their reassignments from those border points will go a long way in fighting Ebola in that part of the country, saying that if it was not for the intervention of Zorzor District Commissioner Henry Wolubah, the youth and the security forces were going to clash for those behaviors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caucus said it has been fighting Ebola out of the district, which has become a safe haven, saying that the Caucus has been working through the youths to conduct sensitization and awareness, sending materials including bleach and buckets etc., to the district in its fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that Lofa County has been the Ebola hotspot in Liberia not until recently. According to reports, the first cases of Ebola in the country were discovered at the Curran Hospital in Zorzor and in Foyah, from where the virus has been spreading throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1189 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INSTEAD OF THE Ambassador of Ghana here remaining taciturn, if not apologetic on our recent report on his country's bulldozer policy against Liberians in that country, he chose to spark open a can of worms not only in shameful denial but also in raining invectives on The Analyst. The Ambassador, Kodjo A. Wadee, described our juxtaposing of the usual bulldozing of Liberians in Budumburam Refugee Camp to the recent undisputed damage control visit of Ghanaian President John Mahama as &quot;unfortunate and mischievous&quot; though in the same breathe of denial the Ambassador admits that the stampede visited upon unsuspecting Liberian refugees took place indeed and at the time it was reported, except that it was an ongoing exercise before the outbreak of Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT GHANA HAS meted out cruelty and inhumanity on Liberians remains a long open secret. The uncouth onslaughts which date as far back as the 1950s and 60s, again renewed in the 1980s before the Liberian refugee exodus in the 1990s, far outclass and dim the offer of a piece of land to Liberians for temporary habitation during and even after the civil conflict. What sort of gratitude does Ghana deserve for the offer of a piece of land which from all indications is its version of South Africa's Soweto? As far as life on Budumburam Camp is concerned--we hate to say &quot;was concerned&quot;--it was a matter of survival of the fittest for the beleaguered refugees. It was a huge open air prison, characterized by daily harassment from the host, unbridled mass deportation, routine assault and battery, indefinite imprisonment and even murder. Budumburam has been more of a concentration camp than a sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN TODAY, THE those who suffered such cruel actions are still nursing the wounds of Ghana's inhumanity having endured various harsh treatments including but not limited to languishing behind cells, some made to spend months in incommunicado, something that gave refugee agencies, particularly the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, its highest distractions ever recorded. Today, for instance, justice is yet to come for over 600 Liberians who were illegally arrested and clawed out of Budumburam in 2008 as is the case with tens of others. Liberian refugees who were gunned down by Ghanaian security forces in 2011. At the onset of the exodus in the 1990s, Liberian refugees were greeted with unprovoked harassment from ordinary Ghanaians backed by their local government authority who barred Liberians from engaging in petit trade and other businesses in Ghanaians markets. This initial bitterness got matured throughout the 20 or more years into an organized, sustained premeditated crackdown, characterized by police raids and sporadic violations of the rights of Liberians even against UNHCR warnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOATH AND HATE of Liberians, manifested in Ghana's constancy of forceful mass deportation, brutal manhandling of Liberians, exclusion of Liberians from doing business in that country, amongst other cruelties seen since the 1950s have spurred high, and there has been no reciprocal action on the part of God-fearing, Africanist Liberia. There is no amount of diplomatic intrigues by that country's Foreign Service personnel, such as Ambassador Kodjo Wadee or the country's head of state's &quot;damage control&quot; visit can acquit the magnitude of egregious crimes committed against Liberians. If our government is silent on this, the civil society here cannot afford to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AND ALL THESE are being done to Liberia against the fact the colossal remittances from broad to refugees, coupled with unprecedented international attention and assistance Liberians' stay in Ghana attracted, have positively impacted the economy of that country. In fact, Ghanaians benefited from, and even practically hijacked, relief supplies and other assistances, such as easy emigration to the United States and Europe at the expense of Liberian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN TODAY, SINCE THE outbreak of Ebola in Liberia, there are reports that Liberians disembarking at Ghana's major airport are subjected to maltreatment--physical embarrassment and psychological torture. The Analyst is currently following a story about the increasing hostility against Liberians entering Ghana and/or when they are in transit in Ghana. In fact, it is reported to us this attitude by Ghanaian immigration authority has been a major problem for a Northern African airplane that reportedly begun refusing to check-in Liberians from the Roberts International Airport because, as one pilot put it, &quot;I usually feel very sorry for Liberians and shame in the way our Liberian passengers are treated upon arrival in Ghana.&quot; It is said that 16 Liberians who arrived in Accra recently, followed by another group of 32 citizens, were pushed around in the corridors of the airport and held for several hours without explicit reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDEED, AMBASSADOR WADEE cannot defend his country's xenophobic attitude as far as the records are concerned. Even if he were to force himself to do so, as he attempted in his undue posturing against The Analyst, no one would take him serious or would ever believe him. For instance, right now, Ghanaian media are reporting that foreign (non-Ghanaian) retailers and petit businesspeople in Ghana are being whisked off--barred from such businesses--in the enforcement of yet another xenophobic national policy. President Mahama had no business embarking upon face-saving tours in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea when he had consciously ordered land, air and sea routes closed to these Ebola-fraught countries. And if he put up a brave face to come around, possibly on the lives and tears of citizens, what makes it &quot;unfortunate and mischievous&quot; for talking or writing about it and tracing Ghana's characteristic brutal and un-African crackdowns on Liberians and other Africans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AND WHAT IS about ingratitude in this instance? Is it the inferno ironically named Budumburam refugee camp offered Liberians? At least, as far as we know, Liberians have shown kindness or what we will call &quot;disproportionate gratitude&quot; to Ghanaians. And this has been shown not only in the Sirleaf-led Government's indifference to the long trails of blood, tears and injustice suffered by hundreds of Liberians in Ghana, but also to the silence and maturity of the general populace of Liberians toward thousands of Ghanaians granted carte blanche in Liberia to do anything peacefully and unperturbed, including holding to major investments and trade interests without question, even while their Liberians were, if not are, virtually held in chains and slavery in Ghana. Any country wanting to demonstrate &quot;ingratitude&quot; would react decisively reciprocally. Ambassador Wadee needs to appreciate this and apologize for his country's continued un-African and xenophobic relations with a meek and embracive Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUR COUNTRY IS facing unprecedented life-threatening crisis caused by Ebola and we don't want to be distracted by discourteous diplomatic sources. We want to do our part to save this nation. However, we remain ever vigilant to respond to a further repudiation of organic facts in Ghana-Liberia relations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press conference addressed by the Managing Director of the Liberia Petroleum Refinery Corporation T. Nelson Williams, who is the Liberian head of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity was attended by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Vice President Joseph Boakai. Liberian Chapter Alpha Kappa Sorority is also led by Dr. Dawn Cooper Barnes, who was also in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The both fraternities in their statement of support to the Liberian government and people in the fight against the virus indicated that their partners and members aboard were able to make some donations in kind and cash, although the amounts involved were not disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the leadership of the two groups, the anti-Ebola materials and equipment that were mobilized abroad by the international members of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Alpha Kappa Sorority were on the way to Liberia and would arrive soon. Mr. Williams, who spoke on behalf of the organizations did not disclose the cash value of the Ebola materials rallied that were being shipped to Liberia under the arrangement of the two groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, indicated that the materials expected in the country will include several cartons of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) including gloves, safety gears among others, which he noted when arrived, will be presented to health workers and health centers to combat the virus. As part of their involvement in the fight against the virus, the two fraternities, said they are not only limited to awareness, they are also involved with the training of over 177 persons in preventive measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Williams, Alpha Phi Alpha and Alpha Kappa Alpha - with support from the Johannesburg Alpha Kappa Alpha (in South Africa) will feed about 150,000 Liberian Ebola victims and survivors under its &quot;Stop Hunger&quot; Feeding Program. He furthered disclosed that the both groups have succeeded in the construction of 100 Ebola treatment centers at the OAU Conference Center in Virginia outside Monrovia to provide effective treatment to Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded that the center will be turned over to the government of Liberia through the Ministry of Health so as to help the government in actively responding to anti-Ebola campaign against the outbreak in the country. He stressed that in the wake of the outbreak of the virus, it was important for Liberians to stop blame shifting and criticizing, but to join hands in wheeling the disease out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE than 160 doctors, nurses, paramedics and other NHS staff have volunteered to go to ebola-ravaged West Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will spend six weeks trying to stem the worst ever outbreak of the disease, which has claimed more than 2,800 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of cases will climb exponentially', with more than 20,000 people infected by the start of November unless urgent action is taken, the World Health Organisation has forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the weekend, the Government's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies asked British healthcare staff to volunteer. By Monday night, 164 had come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be given training before they go on how to prevent the virus spreading in hospitals - and how to protect themselves against infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease has taken a high toll on healthcare workers, including British nurse William Pooley, who caught ebola while working in blood-spattered wards in Sierra Leone. The 29-year-old, who was the first Briton to contact ebola, has since made a full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, experts warned that the disease might be here to stay - and become a part of life like flu, HIV or TB. They said that rather than causing large but short outbreaks, it could mutate so it passes more easily between people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it does become endemic in West Africa, this would raise the odds of it coming to Britain, said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. A &pound;3.2million grant from the trust, one of the world's biggest medical charities, will be used to test much-needed ebola drugs in Africa, with the first doses given in November.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE number of Ebola cases in west Africa could surpass 1.4 million by January and the disease could become endemic, scientists warned in two separate reports published yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that, unless &quot;drastic improvements in control measures&quot; were made, the number of cases - currently 5,800 - could nearly quadruple to 21,000 by the end of next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christopher Dye, the head of strategy at the WHO and a co-author of the study, said: &quot;We've rather modestly only extended the projections to Nov 2, but if you go to ... Jan 2, you're into hundreds of thousands.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was feared that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people this year in the deadliest outbreak in history, could become a &quot;permanent feature of the human population&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The epidemic might simply &quot;rumble on as it has for the last few months for the next few years&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The research by the UN-funded agency also found that the death rate for the current outbreak may be higher than previously calculated - closer to 70 per cent instead of 55 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far Ebola has killed more than 2,800 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO study echoed a &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; report from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. It warned that, without significant increases in international efforts to stem the spread of the virus, it could infect hundreds of thousands in the next three months, leaving 1.4 million sick by January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation also reported that the number of health workers killed by the disease had increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency said that as of Sept 22, a total of 348 health care workers were known to have developed Ebola and 186 of them had died. Half of the cases were in Liberia and 67 in Guinea, which along with Sierra Leone have been worst hit by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Nigeria, 11 health workers have contracted the disease and five have died. In total, Nigeria has had eight Ebola deaths and 20 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first humanitarian representatives from Britain have arrived in Sierra Leone to begin a &pound;100million aid mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 160 staff from the NHS have volunteered to join British teams travelling to the infection zone to try to help. They will be based at a new 62-bed treatment centre in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said: &quot;This outbreak has wide-ranging humanitarian and security consequences for the region, and the world. &quot;Defeating this disease will need a global coalition, as well as innovative approaches to reducing the spread of the virus in communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, said: &quot;Britain's plan will triple bed provision in the country, but we cannot do this alone. Sierra Leone needs urgent offers of support from foreign medical teams and international donors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a member of the team that discovered Ebola in 1976, said the current outbreak was very different from the 24 others that had preceded it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's the first time that entire nations are involved and affected; it's the first time that capital cities are involved with huge urban populations,&quot; he said. &quot;The result is that we have something that I think is a humanitarian crisis. It's no longer a disease outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Piot described the coming together of decades of civil war, corrupt dictatorships, dysfunctional health systems and a slow initial response to the epidemic as a &quot;perfect storm&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British nurse Will Pooley, who contracted Ebola while working in Africa, has agreed to donate blood plasma to treat victims, officials have said, as fears were raised that the epidemic might never end.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blood plasma contains antibodies that fight disease and has been injected into Ebola victims before. Experts said the experimental treatment is their number one hope of a drug to treat the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It comes as 164 NHS workers have volunteered to travel to West Africa to help fight the epidemic, which the World Health Organisation says could affect 20,000 people by November. The volunteers came forward after the Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, and other medical leaders appealed last week for NHS staff to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak is already the biggest recorded. Experts said the virus is adapting to humans and the greatest fear is that the epidemic never dies out and low levels of cases continue. In this scenario the disease could spread outside Africa, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation has revised the mortality rate from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. There have been almost 3,000 deaths since the outbreak began nine months ago.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experimental drugs are to be fast-tracked into west Africa so that they can be tested and, if they work, save lives in the Ebola epidemic, which, experts say, is spiralling out of control. Trials of vaccines are already in their early stages, with healthy British volunteers taking part in safety tests in the UK. The Wellcome Trust is committing &pound;3.2m to set up sites, systems and facilities for drug testing across the affected countries as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is major international concern over the spread of infection and the disintegration of healthcare systems under pressure from the disease. The Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in the US released new projections yesterday saying that in the worst scenario, if the spread of Ebola goes unchecked, there could be 1.4m cases by late January. The WHO has warned that there could be nearly 20,000 cases by early November.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Healthcare systems in the three worst-hit countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have largely collapsed under the strain of coping with what may prove to be one of the most serious viral disease outbreaks in modern times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 40 British military and humanitarian staff have arrived in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to oversee the construction of a UK medical facility, which will be part of the &pound;100m UK commitment to help contain the outbreak. That includes 700 Ebola treatment beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news followed a meeting of the UK's emergency committee, Cobra, yesterday afternoon. &quot;It is now vital that the international community translates its concern into action,&quot; said foreign secretary Philip Hammond. &quot;This outbreak has wide-ranging humanitarian and security consequences for the region, and the world. Defeating this disease will need a global coalition, as well as innovative approaches to reducing the spread of the virus in communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An analysis of the first nine months of the outbreak in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the death rate is 70%, not 50%, when deaths outside hospitals are counted. Many people are too frightened to go to hospital and the number of infections is doubling every few weeks. As of 20 September, the WHO said there had been 5,843 cases and 2,803 confirmed deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some questioned the CDC projection of 1.4m cases. &quot;It's a big assumption that nothing will change in the current outbreak response,&quot; said Dr Armand Sprecher, an infectious disease specialist at Doctors Without Borders. &quot;Ebola outbreaks usually end when people stop touching the sick. The outbreak is not going to end tomorrow, but there are things we can do to reduce the case count.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts fear that Ebola could become endemic in west Africa, instead of a viral disease that causes outbreaks and then disappears again. If that happens, the region could be a reservoir for the spread of the virus to the rest of the world, said Piot and Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, in the New England Journal. They said the epidemic &quot;seems out of control and has evolved into a major humanitarian crisis&quot;. In west Africa &quot;there is a very real danger of a complete breakdown in civic society&quot;, and communities have lost faith in authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several different potential drugs are likely to be trialled in west Africa, including Zmapp, which has already been used on foreign doctors and aid workers with the disease. Current supplies of the drug, made from the tobacco plant, have been used up, but its manufacture is restarting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent experts will decide which potential drugs are suitable for testing - there will have to be safety data before any can be given to patients and a rapid ethical review will have to be undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a huge challenge to carry out clinical trials under such difficult conditions, but ultimately this is the only way we will ever find out whether any new Ebola treatments actually work,&quot; said Farrar. &quot;What's more, rapid trials, followed by large-scale manufacturing and distribution of any effective treatments, might produce medicines that could be used in this epidemic. The Wellcome Trust funding will allow these trials to happen quickly, and in an ethically and scientifically robust setting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The student group also lauded the county lawmakers for their great donations made to the Task Force in Maryland County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a recent news conference in Monrovia, the Public Relations Officer of Pleebo Sodoken University Student Union, Mr. Daniel S. Sargbe lauded the World Health Organization, World Bank, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) for its continuous support to the Liberian Government to enhance efforts in combating the deadly Ebola virus that is claiming the lives of many inhabitants of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PLSUSU Public Relations Officer then called on citizens of Maryland County, especially Pleebo Sodoken District to do away with politics in the fight against the Ebola virus and work together to contain this situation in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, the President of PLSUSU, Mr. Christopher Kyne recommended that the Ebola response mechanisms must be effective by providing ambulances, call centers and Ebola treatment Units in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kyne further stated that there is a need that the Government of Liberia sends medical supplies to Maryland County to enable the citizens receive treatment as healthcare delivery is very essential to the survival of the citizens. He said it is painful and worrisome that there are no drugs in the entire county, something he described as being very heinous and nefarious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Kyne, there should be well structured community base organizations, including religious groups and intellectual centers to carry out Ebola awareness in which the majority of the citizens must be involved in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kyne added that the Liberia National Police (LNP), the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), and other paramilitary groups deployed to enforce regulation must display reasonableness, good conduct, flexibility, without intimidations and harassment of ordinary citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">313 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly six months after the first case of Ebola in West Africa was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and the Security Council have approved resolutions creating the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) to contain the ongoing outbreak which has sickened more than 5,500 people and killed over 2,500.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not just a public health crisis. This is a social crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis and a threat to national security well beyond the outbreak zones,&quot; said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General to the UN Security Council on Thursday. &quot;For these reasons, Mr Secretary-General and I are calling for an UN-wide initiative that draws together all the assets of all relevant UN agencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first time in history that the UN has created a mission for a public health emergency. The Mission will bring together vast resources of the UN agencies, funds and programmes, to reinforce WHO's technical expertise and experience in disease outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While WHO plays a central role in leading public health efforts for this response, the support of other UN agencies is essential to deal with the social, economic, development and security challenges that are affecting these countries and the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This unprecedented outbreak requires an unprecedented response,&quot; said Dr David Nabarro, UN Secretary General's Senior Coordinator for the Ebola Response. &quot;The number of cases has doubled in these countries in the last three weeks. To get in front of this, the response must be increased 20-fold from where it is today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mission will immediately begin to pull together assets from the relevant agencies, and its hub will be located in Accra, Ghana. It will bring together the collective assets of the UN and work closely with the Governments in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">697 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid closure of National Chronicle newspaper coupled with recent denial of the registration of Voice FM 102.7 radio station and report of alleged harassment on Women Voices newspaper, Senior Legal Adviser to the Press Union of Liberia Cllr. Sayma Syrenius Cephus says it is awkward for the PUL to remain on the National Ebola Task Force while its members continue to be allegedly harassed and intimidated by the Liberian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argued that if the PUL must be seen credible and independent, it cannot be part of the Ebola Task Force organized by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf when the rights of some of its members are being abused and trampled upon by the same President.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is sad to see the PUL wearing a toothpaste smile with Ellen and cronies on the same table as &quot;warriors&quot; against Ebola and then the next moment as complainant and defendant in the dock fighting with its life to get out of the clutches of terror and brutality,&quot; Cllr. Cephus said in a letter addressed to the President of the PUL Mr. Kamara A. Kamara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the regime of President Sirleaf prefers to go after the media, punish the &quot;dislikes&quot; to have a &quot;free press&quot; of its own, while singing praises and justifying the sale of oil blocks during this EBOLA crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawyer indicated that while the collective support of all media houses is required in disseminating the requisite information needed by our people to protect themselves, however, President Sirleaf's policy of a free press is &quot;divide and rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Cephus: &quot;The irony is while the regime depends on the Liberian media to get its messages across by including the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) on the Ebola Task Force under the pretext of forging a national cohesion, it is at the same time clamping down on the media with the denial of registration by the Ministry of Information of the Voice FM 102.7 Station because of its critical views; the reported harassment of the Managing Editor of the Women Voices Newspaper and the attacks and illegal closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper absent any judicial order consistent with due process of law. I fail to see how the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) can be a part of a collective effort or how it can rally its members to support the work of the Task Force in the face of these wanton constitutional violations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawyer believes the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) must begin the same approach of critically assessing its continued participation on the so-called Ebola Task force if it wants to be seen as having the moral authority or voice of being the forerunner of democracy for a number of reasons. &quot;First, there seems a concerted attempt by the regime to engage some members of the Liberian media to ignore Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's decision of deploying members of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) in West Point with undefined instructions that ultimately turned out to be a &quot;shoot to kill policy&quot; that led to the death of Shaki Kamara, while scores of other civilians sustained injuries from bullet wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touching on the Chronicle case, Cllr. Cephus said he's going to challenge the illegal closure order of the National Chronicle Newspaper and the denial of the rights of Mr. Philipbert Browne, Publisher of the newspaper, to travel freely in and out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why, I have suggested that a remedial writ of prohibition as a surest way to confront these constitutional violations. The remedy available under the writ of prohibition in my view does not provide a reasonable settlement for damages suffered as a result of the illegal closure order, instead, if it is granted, which has been my prayer, it will only remove the Draconian order of illegal closure and then return the parties to &quot;status quo.&quot; Thus, the remedy available in a writ of prohibition before the Honorable Supreme Court of Liberia is limited to its interpretative constitutional authority but is not sufficient and effective to address further financial claims that the National Chronicle and Mr. Browne may have against the Government of Liberia. We will then have to look elsewhere, probably at the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice based in Abuja, Nigeria for redress,&quot; Cllr. Cephus stressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">786 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council, in its first emergency meeting on a public health crisis, today declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a threat to peace and security, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced that the United Nations will deploy a new emergency health mission to combat one of the most horrific diseases on the planet that has shattered the lives of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This international mission, to be known as the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, or UNMEER, will have five priorities: stopping the outbreak, treating the infected, ensuring essential services, preserving stability and preventing further outbreaks,&quot; Mr. Ban told the Security Council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under the leadership of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the Mission will bring together the full range of UN actors and expertise in support of national efforts,&quot; he said, adding that details of the mission were sent in a letter to the Security Council and the UN General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General said the mission's effectiveness will depend crucially on support from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our best estimate is that we need a 20-fold increase in assistance,&quot; he said. The United Nations this week outlined a set of critical needs totaling almost $1 billion over the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ban spoke before the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution, sponsored by 131 countries - reportedly more than any other sponsors of a resolution to date in the chamber - &quot;determining that the unprecedented extent of the Ebola outbreak in Africa constitute a threat to international peace and security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing concern about the detrimental effect of the isolation of Ebola-hit Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone as a result of trade and travel restrictions imposed on the affected countries, the Council called on Member States, including the region, to such restrictions imposed as a result of the outbreak, and to facilitate the delivery of assistance, including qualified, specialized and trained personnel and supplies to the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing the Council members, Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said: &quot;None of us experienced in containing outbreaks has ever seen, in our lifetimes, an emergency on this scale, with this degree of suffering and with this magnitude of cascading consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasizing that the current reports that show that more than 5,500 people have been infected by Ebola and more than 2,500 killed by it in West Africa are &quot;vast underestimates,&quot; Dr. Chan said the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap outlines 12 critical actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that the United States, United Kingdom, China, Cuba and other countries are using a variety of assets, including military, speaks to the complexity of the challenge,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This surge in support could help turn things around for the roughly 22 million people, in the hardest-hit countries whose lives and societies have been shattered by one of the most horrific diseases on this planet,&quot; Dr. Chan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General said &quot;the penalty for inaction is high. We need to race ahead of the outbreak - and then turn and face it with all our energy and strength.&quot; He called out to non-traditional donors, the business community, for example, to contribute in the health, transport, communications and information sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the UN Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council for the month of September, US Ambassador Samantha Power, said only twice before has the Security Council met to discuss the security implications of a public health issue - both times on the AIDS epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's meeting was the first emergency meeting on a public health issue, according to the Security Council President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his closing remarks to the Council, Dr. David Nabarro, the Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Ebola, welcomed the &quot;powerful solidarity&quot; shown during the day-long meeting for the countries affected, as well as appreciation for what they and their partners are doing to confront the outbreak. Some countries, including from Africa, had offered some significant commitments in support of the international Ebola response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been such an extraordinary outpouring of support from all over the world - a real global coalition,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the press immediately after the meeting, Dr. Chan said she, too, had been touched by the outpouring of solidarity, which &quot;gives us hope that the global community understands the severity of the outbreak and the fact that no one country or organization can address it alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also briefing the Council today was Jackson K. P. Niamah of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) via videoconference from Monrovia, Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking over the weekend when he donated 50 buckets, 20 cartoons of tide soap with some anti Ebola items to residents of Gungbeyah Chiefdom, Gokala Community in Gbarpolu County, Representative Koiwood said the loan program takes effect this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further disclosed that the loan provided by his office is intended to aid citizens purchase materials for their homes and reduce the movement of people to avoid the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the loan will be repaid by installments whenever government settles the salaries of civil servants in Gbarpolu County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gbarpolu County District lawmaker warned that tougher action will be taken against any beneficiary of the loan program who are found plying the streets of Monrovia and its environs in search of their basic needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Representative Koiwood warned Gbarpolu County citizens against eating bush meats and bathing dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there are individuals in Gbarngay Town, Gbarpolu County who are still selling bush meat, noting that if Liberians continue to eat and bath dead bodies, the Ebola pandemic will remain pervasive in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gbarpolu County lawmaker wants Government to provide compensation for citizens volunteering their services in the fight against the incurable Ebola virus that continues to kill Liberians and foreign nationals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iron Resources, which has its operational site in the Gbi Forest, Tappita, Nimba County, is currently exploring iron ore in that part of the country with about 25 Liberians in its employ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens of Quardu-Gborni district in Lofa County have expressed fear that the current situation in their district could deteriorate if nothing is done immediately to have food and medical supplies in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district once considered to be the hot spot center of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, has made some improvements in recent weeks with low deaths recorded, following the intervention of Doctors without Borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fumbah V. Kanneh, an executive of Quardu-Gborni Taskforce told journalists Monday that there are shortages of food and medical supplies in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanneh said that food provided by the WFP and other philanthropists were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanneh explained that people in the district were experiencing immense hardship due to the measure instituted which has led to the entire area been quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that community leaders have also quarantined some homes within the district due to the reported deaths and for fear that people leaving those homes may spread the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged assistance rendered by Vice President Joseph N Boakai, Representative Mariamu B. Fofana and citizens of the district in Monrovia and the Diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that citizens of the district in the Diaspora and Monrovia have rallied and presented 100 bags of rice to the people in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, Mr. Mohammed M. Kelleh recalled the deaths in the district to two hundred three persons; something he said speaks volume to how the district has been affected by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the government to enhance the capacity of volunteers in the county so that they will spread messages of prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Madam Madusu Sheriff-Sesay, an executive of the taskforce called on government and the international partners to establish a treatment center in the district which will be utilized to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that hospitals and clinics in other parts of the county should also be opened to address the health care needs of the people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1079 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia is one lucky country on Planet Earth; its social, economic and political woes often attracting massive instantaneous international interventions. And it seems this usual favorable global goodwill towards Liberia renders the nation complacent to do things on its own - to pick up where the help ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And further compounding the issue, pundits observe, is the somewhat unsustainable or impermanent intervention strategies of the Good Samaritans. In the case of Ebola, which impact is more immediate and deadly, something has got to be done to fend off recurrence at least in the short run.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person who is pushing this point hard to international partners amid the Ebola crisis is former Public Works Minister Kofi Woods. In a meeting in the United States, Woods says the magnitude of the outbreak of the deadly virus not only calls for decisive response, but also a sustainable reorder of the country's post-Ebola health sector. The Analyst reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am from Liberia but I come to make a case for the region and emphasize the global consequences of the Ebola Crisis. My case is one for utmost urgency. The US support is commendable, but must resist trappings that will distract or seek to view this as an event. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the traditional peacekeeping or emergency intervention mission without the fundamentals of long-term institution building. This plan must encapsulate a long term strategy that will rehabilitate and upgrade the health sector in the region to deal with any future health tragedy of this magnitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were the words of former Public Works Minister Atty. Kofi Woods last Friday, September 20, 2014 at a Board meeting of the United Methodist Church in Washington, D. C., the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, according to a dispatch from the US, asserted that a global tragedy of the magnitude of the current Ebola outbreak requires a decisive global response, and added, &quot;Any plan must encapsulate a long term strategy that will rehabilitate and upgrade the health sector to deal with any future health tragedy of this magnitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian human rights lawyer urged the United States and the international community to assist Liberia in not just addressing the Ebola epidemic but in building Liberia's broken healthcare system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While praising the massive response by the international community to the Ebola epidemic currently ravaging the West African sub-region, Woods noted that this intervention must include a long-term strategy to rehabilitate and upgrade the healthcare sector in the region, if a similar catastrophe is to be avoided in the future. He noted that it is the weakness and failure of the region's health care infrastructure that is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know too well that emergency intervention has always been at the expense of long term capacity and institution building leaving countries in a hallow of a vicious circle tethering on the brink of another disaster. Liberia is a case in point. This should not be repeated,&quot; Woods said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the rapid spread and untold devastation of the Ebola virus in the region, among other things, to the region's poor healthcare system, sluggish and poor response of governments in the affected countries, as well as the failure of the international community to intervene at an early stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him it took at least six months after the outbreak of the disease and thousands of deaths and the threat of a global spread to get the international community's attention. Woods challenged governments in the region to use the tragedy of the Ebola epidemic as a wakeup call to prioritize the building of a reliable functioning healthcare infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, as the Ebola epidemic continues to gain steam and to ravage the country, amidst dire predictions by the United Nations, the World Health Organization, U.S. health authorities, and frontline health workers battling the disease, that the epidemic is on pace to claim several thousand more lives, Mr. Samuel Kofi Woods, is calling on the Liberian government to invest its considerable manpower resources to the fight against the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking yesterday (Thursday, September 18,2014) at an extraordinary session of the United Nations, the first ever called to discuss a health crisis, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon described the current outbreak, which is now greater than the previous 20 Ebola outbreaks combined, a &quot;threat to international peace and security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The spread of the disease is outpacing the response,&quot; Ban noted; while announcing the creation of a new commission known as the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (or, UNMEER). The new initiative will combine the efforts of the World Health Organization and the UN, and bring together a &quot;full range of actors&quot; with the expertise needed to contain Ebola in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organization (WHO) Director Margaret Chan described the Ebola epidemic as &quot;one of the most horrific diseases on the planet.&quot; Presenting a graphic picture of Ebola epidemic on the West African region, the WHO Director noted that in the six months since it began, more than 5,500 people have been infected and well over 2,500 have died--shocking figures that Chan called a &quot;vast underestimate&quot; of the reality. Every two weeks, the number of cases and deaths doubles. The number is particularly frightening given the magnitude of those at risk in the hardest hit countries, just over 22 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A triage nurse with the international medical relief agency Medecine San Frontiers (MSF or Doctors Without Borders) who addressed the UN gathering via webcam from Monrovia, Liberia sent out a grim SOS message:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not have the capacity to respond to the crisis on our own, If the international community does not stand up, we will be wiped out. We have to turn people away and they are dying at our front gates.&quot; &quot;Right now, as I speak, there are patients sitting at our front gates literally begging their lives. They are left alone; they die a horrible, undignified death alone. We are failing the sick because there are not enough people on the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please send your helicopters, your beds, your experts;&quot; but know that we also need the basics. There are still homes in Monrovia that do not have soap, water, buckets, or food,&quot; he told the UN leaders. The nurse pleaded with the UN Security Council, and the international community as a whole, to step up their response.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Mayor of the Commercial hub of Ganta in Nimba County, Mr. D. Dorr Cooper, has disclosed that there is no Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Cooper, addressing the regular Ebola Briefing yesterday at the Ministry of Information said Ganta which is the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in the county noted that it is not only medication that is lacking in the area but efforts aimed at enhancing protection of people against the deadly virus is also a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out this is so because Ganta like other places have people who are still in the denial stage and as such people are not changing their way of life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Cooper told journalists that since the Ebola outbreak between 55 to 60 persons have died as a result of the virus because from the beginning most Health Care Workers (HCW) were leaving the hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor said to remedy the situation in Ganta City, he and his city council had to mobilize resources which led to the donation of a pick-up truck by one of the county's Representatives while he (Cooper) had to contribute a personal amount of US$1000.00</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said 28 zones were set up throughout the city of Ganta with their respective zonal heads spreading all over the city urging people not to take Ebola lightly. &quot;As a result of this and due to the lack of an Ebola Treatment Center we organized ourselves and decided to treat infected person at the community level,&quot; Mayor Cooper disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said one of the difficulties being encountered by the people of Ganta stems from the fact that before someone can be confirmed as having the Ebola virus, their blood specimens have to be sent to Monrovia and within a period of three to five days before the result of such specimens can be brought to Ganta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Cooper observed that one of the greatest challenges being faced in the city is for people to accept those who are being discharged from Ebola Treatment Center in Monrovia, saying, &quot;When these people return to Nimba, they are rejected by the local people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, an Ebola Consultant, Dr. Atat Omoruto has launched a public appeal for the donation of blood which is needed to save the lives of those infected with the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omorunto who heads the newly opened Island Clinic Ebola Treatment Unit said the clinic needs blood of any healthy person especially that of those who had survived the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She disclosed that this methodology to infuse blood into infected person has worked in several countries that have been affected by Ebola. &quot;This blood infusion process especially that of an Ebola survival can heal infected person,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omorunto who is the World Health Organization (WHO) Consultant for Ebola Case Management said, &quot;My duty is to ensure that all patients that come here should be cured from Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She indicated that the Island Clinic Ebola Treatment Center which was opened last Sunday is already overwhelmed as it currently has 173 patients. The Island Clinic is a 150 bed health center but Dr. Omorunto said they are now treating people in the corridor of the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She further disclosed that since the opening of the Island Clinic Treatment Center last Sunday, 20 persons had died as result of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She advised people to come early to the Ebola Treatment Center if they must be cured saying &quot;When you walk into an Ebola Treatment Center, you can walk out but if you come on a stretcher, you leave the center on a stretcher.&quot; She said early treatment is good and advised the public that whenever one is treating a Malaria case, they must give anti-malaria medicine and anti-biotic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruto, a Ugandan added that the over 200 Health Care Workers that are currently working at the clinic are being trained to take up assignment at other treatment centers. She said similar training was carried out at the JFK Ebola Treatment Center and those who benefited are now rendering services at other centers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious disorder erupted yesterday at the compound of the National Legislature when members of the House of Representatives invited the Superintendent of Nimba County and his deputy for questioning in its plenary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group like all other unauthorized persons had to wait outside the building because of the new measures put in place at the Legislature, a political theatre, which is, one must have a pass before entering which seems a very new procedure to witnessing the day-to-day deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the group was divided with some residents against while others were infavor of the decision of the lawmakers and just as they were preparing for plenary, Montserrado County Representative, Solomon George, walked from his vehicle and upon seeing the crowd infront of the entrance, spilled one of his usual languages that begin the day's discussion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative George walking past the crowd used profanity that did not pass the ears of one of the by-standers who inquired by saying, &quot;Why are you insulting our County Superintendent&quot;?and before the crowd could notice, Rep. George shouted, &quot;who said it, who said it,&quot;? He then walked right up to the guy and placed double slaps in his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before anyone would get involved, the police at the entrance of the building whisked the lawmaker inside the building thereby preventing the crowd or the victim from laying hands on him but that prompted a loud noise with eyewitnesses expressing their disenchantment over the behavior of the lawmaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loud noise and threats from the angry crowd prompted the lawmakers to invite a huge presence of police officers within the premises of the Capitol Building without coming out to inquire what had caused the crowd to be so furious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of Nimba County gathered outside the main entrance of the Capitol Building in groups comprising of those in favor and those against the plenary's decision to invite Superintendent Fong Zwagele for questioning while the other group is calling on the President to dismiss the County Superintendent for his inability to lead the residents of Nimba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of the Superintendent was discussed in plenary where members of the House of Representatives asked him how the US$ 100,000 approved by that body for the use of the County Health team was disbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers also raised concerns about the unilateral suspension of the County's Project Management Committee Chairperson by the Superintendent. Information available to them is that Superintendent Zwagele misdirected the funds approved to be used in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admitting to the suspension of the PMC chairperson, the Nimba County Superintendent told the body that it was due to administrative fraud but the august body disagreed with the decision terming it as a violation of the resolution that gives authority to the PMC to operate in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers also told the Superintendent that his decision to suspend was also a violation of the budget law because the PMC should be the section responsible to disburse funds approved for use by the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairperson of the PMC is elected through a resolution for three years and besides that same resolution, nobody has the sole right to dismiss or suspend him/her for any reason; the plenary informed the Superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of the misdirection of the approved funds for the County Health team, members of the House of Representatives adjudged the Superintendent of not having the authority to divide it to chiefs, commissioners or city mayor even if it was for the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nimba Caucus informed the plenary that the money was intended for the County Health team instead bulk of it cannot be accounted for. Meanwhile, one group of Nimba residents are advocating that due to the suffering already meted upon them, the Superintendent should be dismissed while the other group is advocating that the Superintendent be left untouched because he is helpful in the county especially in the fight against the spread of the virus terming the Caucus as being greedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The according to information from the House's all day closed door plenary has however decided to cast a vote of no confidence in the leadership of Superintendent Zwaigele and Mr. Yolor and also information gathered states that it will communicate its decision to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as of today but Superintendent Zwaigele said he has no regrets</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Joseph stated that effort being made by the district is highly accepted. &quot;It may look small but it is useful most especially in a crisis that everyone is now faced with,&quot; Rep. Joseph intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot; There are challenges that we are surrounded with right now; one of my men who is the head of the team is now down with the virus, while trying to save the live of a little boy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Joseph concluded that the deadly Ebola virus will be overcome only if we work together.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Ebola virus is taking toll on the lives of Liberians, the Association of Female Lawyers of Liberia (AFELL) has embarked on identifying with the success stories at the various health care centers in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the success stories identified by the Association were that of pregnant women who chose to visit the John F. Kennedy Medical Center upon its reopening to have safe delivery. AFELL yesterday presented about 200 sacs of mineral water to the administration of the government referral hospital for use by those mothers they described as being keen on new growth in the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of AFELL, its founding president, Gloria Musu Scott said their visit was based upon seeing the needs at the maternity ward of the hospital, thought it necessary to give the women hope and life as they bring in new lives to fill the vacuum that has been created by the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Scott said water is life and it is hoped that as the new born mothers drink they will have strength to take care of the young ones as the gesture was presented by the Association's president, Esther Seaton-Cee on behalf of her colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hospital Administrator, Wannie Mae Scott McDonald thanked the lawyers for the gesture and said since the reopening of the health facility for normal health care services over 100 women have been catered to at its maternity center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said what is the success story for them is that women are pouring in for prenatal services at the center and thanked God that there have been no deaths and there is total team work. On the Ebola issues, Dr. McDonald explained how the Ebola unit is a project that is using portion of the JFK property but it is not a component of or managed by the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said testing is done at the hospital and upon being sure that the person is suspected of carrying the virus, he/she is transferred to the center just right on 24th Street for proper anti- Ebola care and their admittance is for 20 days at the hospital so that the test can be performed within 24 hours using a special system that is set up at the hospital for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Billy Johnson, said the need for the hospital at this time is to get enough Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that would aid them in their work because much cannot be achieved when the health care workers are not confident about being protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a single use of PPE costs about US$ 25 and pleaded that those who want to direct their humanitarian gestures to the hospital should do so by purchasing PPEs for the essential workers so that it enhances the quality of their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Association also paid a courtesy visit to the ELWA center and met with Dr. Jerry Brown and chatted briefly showing concern about the employees as well as the victims and survivors. Dr. Brown reiterated the need to protect the health workers outside of their scope of duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is becoming an alarm that workers in the Ebola centers are being thrown out of their homes because of where they work and that is causing them serious embarrassment. He then informed the lawyers who are at the center that it is only the bottle water that is required because it is difficult to feed a patient using the sacs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the lawyers who took serious notice of the statement of health care workers being thrown out because of where they work and termed it as being illegal to evict a health practitioner because of their job description especially in these troubling times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers promised to intervene into the situation and bring to book anyone caught meting out such treatment on a health care worker in such manner and form and also promised to make good their donation which will also include several sacs of bottle water in subsequent time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFELL president, Seaton-Cee said fliers were made and messages were aired in the fight against the virus before embarking on the donation. She said the donation of water is to help the patients replace their fluids that were lost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">757 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's Foreign Minister, Augustine Ngafuan has urged the global community to act robustly and speedily in tackling the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa. Minister Ngafuan noted that the global community cannot remain passive and allow terrifying predictions on the number of persons to be infected by the Ebola virus in the coming weeks and months to come to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated some three weeks ago that 20,000 persons run the risk of being infected (half of whom may come from Liberia alone), while US President Barack Obama has expressed fear that if the current trend continues, hundreds of thousands of people may be infected with the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot sit idly and watch, as we would do watching a movie on our TV screens. The sobering reality is that we are not watching a pre-recorded movie with a pre-determined climax. We, Ebola affected countries, as well as countries, institutions and individuals of good conscience across the globe, are all actors in this evolving plot and can affect the ultimate outcome based on what we do or fail to do. It would be tragically shameful if we failed to act quickly, robustly, and concertedly in putting an end to the spread of this deadly disease&quot;, Foreign Minister Ngafuan asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Foreign Minister's appeal was contained in his statement delivered Thursday, September 18, 2014 at an open debate of the UN Security Council in New York, the United States of America on the topic: &quot;Peace And Security In Africa: Ebola&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the impact of Ebola on Liberia as multidimensional, the Liberian Foreign Minister told the global gathering that the Ebola outbreak has distracted Liberia's attention from some key national priorities and has gravely undermined the country's ability to address the challenges, with the attendant risk of adversely affecting peace and security in Liberia and the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we mourn daily the loss of a family member, a friend or a fellow citizen as a result of Ebola, we are getting increasingly concerned about the long-term socioeconomic difficulties that the Ebola Virus Disease will occasion&quot;, he stated, calling the world's attention to the negative impacts the outbreak is leaving on all sectors in the country with the mining, agriculture, and services sectors expected to bear the greatest brunt of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the huge toll Ebola has taken on Liberian health care workers and the country's general health system has seriously undermined Liberia's ability to adequately respond to routine illnesses such as malaria, typhoid fever, measles, and diarrhea and an increasing number of pregnant women are now dying while trying to give life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Ngafuan hoped that Thursday's deliberations would spur a response from the global community commensurate with the speed and intensity of the Ebola challenge. He then extended Liberia's profound appreciation to the Secretary General for his many initiatives, including Ban Ki Moon's Thursday's announcement of a new UN Mission (UNMEER) that would scale up the response and mobilize the international community to deliver urgently needed support in a coordinated manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While commending some members of the international community for lending hands of solidarity and empathy to Ebola-affected countries, he again expressed shock and said the Liberian Government remains concerned by the actions of others in imposing travel and other restrictions on Ebola-affected countries: &quot;We therefore call upon the concerned member states to reconsider their policies in light of the expert advice provided by the specialized international agencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thank the wider international community, including the African Union for all the effort and the resources (financial, human, and material) that have so far been dedicated to the fight against Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the US' assistance, Minister Ngafuan, on behalf of the Liberian Government and Liberian people offer deep gratitude to President Obama and the people of the United States for what he described as the heartwarming announcement that the US Government will take a host of bold and concrete initiatives, including the deployment of engineers, military and medical personnel and equipment to the region to establish new treatment units and to train national staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that as a major power, the United States has made a major move. He then hoped that new, additional and complementary contributions will be forthcoming to the affected region in the true expression of international solidarity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maternal and Child- Health International, (MCHI) based in the United Kingdom has donated a consignment of medical supplies and equipment to the C.B. Dunbar and Phebe hospitals in Bong County. Making the presentation Tuesday in Gbarnga, the Honorary Medical Director of the Charity, Professor David Southall said, the donation was part of efforts by MCHI to enhance its partnership with the two hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Southall, a professor of Pediatrics and maternal health said his organization was aware of the challenges facing the two hospitals and will continue to foster the partnership for effective health care services at the two facilities. Professor Southall disclosed that some of the materials were purchased by his organization while others were donated to the Charity by some hospitals in the United Kingdom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the materials were shipped to Liberia on board a 40 feet container through the assistance of the British Councilman Mr. David Parker. Some of the equipment provided to the two hospitals included, two Oxygen generators, and twenty pieces of Oxygen concentrators as well as two emergency centers for new born babies, Antibiotic Drugs among other medications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the materials on behalf of the two hospitals, Bong County health officer Dr. Sampson Arzuakoi said the donation came at the time when health care in the County is at a critical point. Dr. Arzuakoi commended the Charity for the donation and assured that it would be used to improve the health care delivery system of Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, C.B Dunbar Hospital Medical Director Obed Dolo and Phebe Hospital Medical Director, Jefferson Sabley recounted the long standing partnership between the maternal and Child- Health International, (MCHI) and the two hospitals. Doctors Dolo and Sabley noted that the Charity has been very instrumental in providing specialized trainings to key sections at the two hospitals, naming the eye clinic, Emergency Unit, Neo-natal unit amongst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two Medical Directors expressed the hope that the materials will greatly help in the reduction of maternal mortality. They extended thanks not only to the maternal and Child-health International but the government and people of the UK for the donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Phebe Hospital on September 16, 2014, resumed full medical services to the after temporary closure for more than two months. According to the Hospital's Administration at least six health care providers at the health center have died since the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola attack on the Hospital staff led nurses and other support staff to abandon the Hospital also demanding government to provide Personal Protective Equipment, PPEs, Risk allowances, the construction of Ebola Holding and Treatment Center in Bong County to cater to suspected patients coming at the Hospital and other health facilities in the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hospital's Chief Medical Director, Jefferson Sabley told our Bong County Correspondent, that the health care providers return to work Tuesday after the Ebola Treatment Center in Suakoko District started taking patients and suspected cases. Dr. Sabley said government has also provided PPEs for health workers at the hospital and said the Board of the Phebe Hospital is working on risk compensation for health care providers assigned at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said though the Health Workers are encouraged to return to work, the Phebe Hospital needs drugs and Ambulance to adequately response in providing health services to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, C.B Dunbar Maternity Hospital in Gbarnga is yet to commence full medical services. The Maternity Hospital has been temporally closed as the result of the death of health care providers in Bong County. The Hospital employees have also requested the government to provide the PPEs and risk benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">4401 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force formed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to fight the deadly Ebola virus appears to be a representation of a broad-spectrum of the Liberian society. The President chairs the task force of which the Ministry of Defense, Armed Forces of Liberia and other state security forces are a part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with its policy to fight the deadly virus, the Government, implicitly meaning the taskforce, declared a state of emergency, imposed curfew and is quarantining communities--actions not only vehemently denounced by health and human rights experts, but also have been having their toll on unsuspecting people and groups, including the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the Press Union of Liberia, which espouses free expression, human rights and civil liberties, is a member of the task force and under its watch, direct unwarranted attacks are directed at the media and ordinary people. This is apparently a serious concern for the man who has long put his neck on the chopping board for journalists and indigenous--the lead counsel of the PUL. In a letter to the president of the Union, Julius Sayma Syrenius Cephus, wants PUL pull out from the Ebola task force. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent Liberian &quot;poor-man lawyer&quot;, Cyrenius Cephus, says the Press Union of Liberia cannot be a part of the EBOLA Task Force &quot;that is not only proficient in the noisy publicity campaign, but also frail inactions because it is dominated by cronies of Ellen and belly-driven apologists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior legal advisor to the PUL said it is an irony that while the Ellen Johnson regime depends on the Liberian media to get its messages across by including the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) on the Ebola Task Force under the pretext of forging a national cohesion, it is at the same time clamping down on the media with the denial of registration by the Ministry of Information of the Voice FM 102.7 radio station because of its critical views; harassing the Managing Editor of the Women Voices Newspaper and the attacks and illegal closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper absent any judicial order consistent with due process of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fail to see how the Press Union of Liberia(PUL) can be a part of a collective effort or how it can rally its members to support the work of the Task Force in the face of these wanton constitutional violations,&quot; said Cllr. Cephus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to PUL's Kamara A. Kamara, the Liberian luminary lawyer said: &quot;Too many ugly events have fizzled out of their hideouts revealing a rather crude and primitive actions of the current regime and its use of scare tactics, terror and brutality against the Liberian media and practicing journalists, not least, the National Chronicle Newspaper and Mr. Philipbert S. Browne and the wanton abuse of the rights of Liberians to enforce nonresistance to its intemperate schemes of broad day theft, looting and robbery taking place at every level of the regime under the pretext of fighting the deadly EBOLA virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I tried to grapple with solutions like many of my fellow compatriots, who are witnessing with regrets, the gradual slide of our dear country into the abysmal path of terror and recrimination, the only source of respite from the painful reminder of being led by a &quot;rogue regime&quot; has been the free press, entertaining, educating and informing our people, but this too, is now under attack in the name of fighting the deadly EBOLA virus compounded by a state of emergency and curfew.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion of the Legal Adviser To The Press Union of Liberia (PUL)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kamara A. Kamara</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia, Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. President:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many ugly events have fizzled out of their hideouts revealing a rather crude and primitive actions of the current regime and its use of scare tactics, terror and brutality against the Liberian media and practicing journalists, not least, the National Chronicle Newspaper and Mr. Philipbert S. Browne and the wanton abuse of the rights of Liberians to enforce nonresistance to its intemperate schemes of broad day theft, looting and robbery taking place at every level of the regime under the pretext of fighting the deadly EBOLA virus. As I tried to grapple with solutions like many of my fellow compatriots, who are witnessing with regrets, the gradual slide of our dear country into the abysmal path of terror and recrimination, the only source of respite from the painful reminder of being led by a &quot;rogue regime&quot; has been the free press, entertaining, educating and informing our people, but this too, is now under attack in the name of fighting the deadly Ebolavirus compounded by a state of emergency and curfew. I insist, although not an advocate of dooms that this regime is a clear reflection of what the Greek Philosopher Thucydides who live in 260 B.C. refers to when he posited that: &quot;The nation that will insist on drawing a broad line of demarcation between the fighting man and the thinking man is liable to find its fighting done by fools and its thinking done by cowards.&quot; For a regime that once classified its civil servants into &quot;right-sized and downsized&quot; at the primordial stages of its inception and thereby caused a serious division in the nation, what other evidence does one need to clearly read and understand the logic of Thucydides?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will recall that the relation between the current government and the Liberian media for the last eight years since the ascendancy of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to the presidency of our country has been an on and off situation, sometimes fairly good; sometimes rough, sour and bitter. As the mirror reflection of society the Liberian media has never budged an inch to allow any form of political blackmail from this regime to overshadow its social responsibility to the Liberian state. Thus, the lifespan of the press has been full of thorns and bristles largely due to economic strangulation and the regime policy of divide and rule. This regime cannot be trusted and I thought many of you in the media would have known this by now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from losing its moral balance, focus and the shared vision to lead, this regime already saturated with charlatans and pranksters, who, from the outset of the EBOLA virus outbreak, felt that a noisy publicity campaign was the surest way of winning the supports of unsuspecting donors and friendly governments to throw huge financial resources at them like &quot;Manna falling from Heaven&quot; but found its stratagems unasked by the Liberian press, is no doubt fighting back ferociously to silent certain media houses in the name of the amorphous argument of protecting &quot;national security.&quot;Comically, a medical emergency that should have been headed by professional medical practitioners and medical students has become a fanfare and a political jamboree for Ellen and cronies. However, at the spiraling rate of new Ebola cases and the distressing death tolls in Lofa and Bomi Counties, and now Montserrado County and Monrovia, where the EBOLA virus now persists, causing premature deaths of scores of Liberians, the regime lacking any clear-cut policy on how to deal with this deadly virus, strangely rushed at the hasty conclusion to form a National Task Force with the inclusion of the Press Union of Liberia(PUL) as member to mislead public opinion that the composition of the Task Force cuts across the political divide. Never mind, Ellen is in charge as she has been on the sale of all oil blocks as the &quot;single most visible proprietress&quot; of Liberian oil to which the PUL can never be a member. Absolutely unperturbed by the dreadful news of the EBOLA death tolls on a daily basis, this regime lives in a state of paranoia not as a result of Ebola outbreak but because the free press has exposed the frailties and viciousness of the presidency in its attempts to market four oil blocks under the noise of the deadly Ebola virus. The regime prefers to go after the media, punish the &quot;dislikes&quot; to have a &quot;free press&quot; of its own, singing praises and justifying the sale of oil blocks during this EBOLA crisis. You will recall that the collective support of all media houses is required in disseminating the requisite information needed by our people to protect themselves, yet, Ellen's policy of a free press is divide and rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony is while the regime depends on the Liberian media to get its messages across by including the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) on the Ebola Task Force under the pretext of forging a national cohesion, it is at the same time clamping down on the media with the denial of registration by the Ministry of Information of the Voice FM 102.7 Station because of its critical views; the reported harassment of the Managing Editor of the Women Voices Newspaper and the attacks and illegal closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper absent any judicial order consistent with due process of law. I fail to see how the Press Union of Liberia(PUL) can be a part of a collective effort or how it can rally its members to support the work of the Task Force in the face of these wanton constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) must begin the sane approach of critically assessing its continued participation on the so-called Ebola Task force if it wants to be seen as having the moral authority or voice of being the forerunner of democracy for a number of reasons. First, there seems a concerted attempt by the regime to engage some members of the Liberian media to ignore Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's decision of deploying members of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) in West Point with undefined instructions that ultimately turned out to be a &quot;shoot to kill policy&quot; that led to the death of Shaki Kamara, while scores of other civilians sustained injuries from bullet wounds. Like the late Kromah who was shot at point range at the Congress for Democratic Change Headquarters on November 7, 2011,Shaki Kamara was alive until President Sirleaf ordered the deployment of armed soldiers in West Point. I am told that one other kid who was shot in the stomach by the soldiers is on a critical list and cannot get treatment abroad. The PUL cannot be a part of an EBOLA Task Force that is only proficient in the noisy publicity campaign, but frail inactions because it is dominated by cronies of Ellen and belly-driven apologists. Please note that since 1847, no government has ever caused the deployment of the Liberian Army against its own citizens for the outbreak of a deadly virus than this regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 85 of the 1986 Constitution of Liberia states: &quot;The President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, may order any portion of the Armed Forces into a state of combat readiness in defense of the Republic, before or after the declaration of a state of emergency, as may be warranted by the situation. All military power or authority shall at all times, however, be held in subordination to the civil authority and the Constitution.&quot; The expression of: &quot;The President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, may order any portion of the Armed Forces into a state of combat readiness in defense of the Republic, before or after the declaration of a state of emergency, as may be warranted by the situation&quot; as used in Article 85, when read together with Article 86(b) of the 1986 Constitution refers to a physical threat, civil war or rebellion that presents a clear and present danger to the Liberian state. Was West Point the source of any civil disobedience, or public unrest? Here, command responsibility takes the center stage and the Press Union of Liberia must be seen as raising its voice for a credible and independent probe other than what's been set up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious Concern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than a 'National Health Emergency', we are under a state of emergency and curfew. Of course, all members of the Ebola Task Force team are excluded from the curfew, but not members of the PUL. It is true that the 1986 Constitution does not have a &quot;National Health Emergency&quot; and therefore it is acceptable that based on the clear and present danger that the deadly Ebola virus poses, a state of emergency is unavoidable but other key provisions of the 1986 Constitution, specifically Article 88 should be taken into account. Article 88 of the 1986 Constitution states:&quot; The President shall, immediately upon the declaration of a state of emergency, but not later than seven days thereafter, lay before the Legislature at its regular session or at a specially convened session, the facts and circumstances leading to such declaration. The Legislature shall, within seventy-two hours, by joint resolution voted by two-thirds of the membership of each house, decide whether the proclamation of a state of emergency is justified or whether the measures taken thereunder are appropriate. If the two-thirds vote is not obtained, the emergency automatically shall be revoked. Where the Legislature shall deem it necessary to revoke the state of emergency or to modify the measures taken thereunder, the President shall act accordingly and immediately carry out the decisions of the Legislature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the declaration of the state of emergency, followed by the deployment of armed soldiers and the imposition of a nighttime curfew about two months ago, the nation is yet to be told &quot;the facts and circumstances leading to such declaration&quot; AGAINST AN UNSEEN EBOLA VIRUS and the legislature since the reported two-thirds majority votes of each House have not stated the necessity or justification of the measures taken under the state of emergency. If it is established that the Ebola Virus is more contagious under the cover of darkness and anyone who stays up risks contracting it, isn't fair for our government to tell us? Is it that the inclusion of the Press Union of Liberia(PUL) on the Ebola Task Force also means the PUL understands the virulent nature of the virus at night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. President you should remember at the inception of the state of emergency and the imposition of night time curfew, President Sirleaf put herself on record, although most times unpredictable once it involves the Liberian media, by indicating that certain constitutional rights would have been suspended. So what are those rights that have been suspended anyway? The Liberia media must uphold the constitutional guarantee of the public unlimited right to information regarding the duration of the curfew, rights that have been suspended among others. Article 15(c) of the 1986 Constitution guarantees an unfettered and unlimited right to the Liberian people to be informed about their government and its functionaries; its policies and decisions(emphasis our). What are the measures taken by the PUL to demand that the government, state which rights that have been suspended? With its game of political brinkmanship, this regime has created a symbiosis between its iron-fisted policy of harassing anyone who challenges its excesses openly by the use of its police power and its quiet but ferocious bullying tactics of intimidating the courts and using professional fraternities to threaten any of its members who continually defend the free press. I am not afraid of what the regime is doing both in and out of court, but I am afraid that the support of a vigorous defense from professional colleagues in difficult circumstances where media entities and practitioners are dragged into the court by this is regime is incredibly waning. You will also recall that I have always and will always provide pro bono legal services in return for what the PUL has done for me in my days of despair and denial. Giving the bullying tactics of this regime and the flight of many lawyers because of the Ebola crisis, it was somehow difficult to rally a team of professional lawyers and I had to revert to my friends of yesteryears, most of whom were my classmates and schoolmates from Tubman High School and know what it means to be denied of one's basic freedoms. Of course, other refused and I cannot blame them, because they see the PUL as a 'contractor' of the regime always asking its members to polish the failed policies of this regime and see the current flexing of muscles by the regime to 'teach' certain PUL members a hard lesson. As contractors themselves, I am sure they do not want to put their interest at risk. If the PUL must be seen as credible and independent it cannot be part of the Ebola Task Force organized by Ellen when the rights of certain of its members are being continually abused and trampled upon by the same Ellen. It is sad to see the PUL wearing a toothpaste smile with Ellen and cronies on the same table as &quot;warriors&quot; against Ebola and then the next moment as complainant and defendant in the dock fighting with its life to get out of the clutches of terror and brutality. If this regime was responsible and reasonable enough, it would have realized that the closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper is illegal. Again, thousands of US dollars from donors will be wasted on a court process simply to protect the Liberian press against its own government. I am quite confident that this matter may transcend the borders of Liberia if we are to get the kind of redress we need. As you may know, most Liberian lawyers hardly ever read other regional and international court opinions. And professing to be versed in their own country's laws, which are somewhat limited in scope and character in terms of the quality of relief required, it is always an uphill task to suggest other available avenues for relief beyond the borders of Liberia. Even though their argument is either driven by ignorance or always shrouded in &quot;sovereignty&quot; which to me is nothing less than an joke but this is how they see things! In the instant case, we are challenging the illegal closure order of the National Chronicle Newspaper and the denial of the rights of Mr. Philipbert Browne to travel freely in and out of Liberia. This is why, I have suggested that a remedial writ of prohibition as a surest way to confront these constitutional violations. The remedy available under the writ of prohibition in my view does not provide a reasonable settlement for damages suffered as a result of the illegal closure order, instead, if it is granted, which has been my prayer, it will only remove the Draconian order of illegal closure and then return the parties to &quot;status quo.&quot; Thus, the remedy available in a writ of prohibition before the Honorable Supreme Court of Liberia is limited to its interpretative constitutional authority but is not sufficient and effective to address further financial claims that the National Chronicle and Mr. Browne may have against the Government of Liberia. We will then have to look elsewhere, probably at the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice based in Abuja, Nigeria for redress. As member of the comity of nations that professes to uphold the tenets of democracy and rule of law, this government must be held accountable by its own standards before local and international tribunals to avert the continued violations of the rights of its own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, in the case: &quot;Mike Campbell (Pvt) Limited and Others v. Zimbabwe (2008) AHRLR 199 (SADC 2008)&quot;, the Southern Africa Development Community Tribunal quoted Professor Malcolm Shaw in his treatise entitled International law at pages 104-105 as follows: &quot;It is no defence to a breach of an international obligation to argue that the state acted in such a manner because it was following the dictates of its own municipal laws. The reason for this inability to put forward internal rules as an excuse to evade international obligation are obvious. Any other situation would permit international law to be evaded by the simple method of domestic legislation.&quot; The Tribunal also highlighted the principle contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, in which it is provided in the article 27 as follows: 'A party may not invoke provisions of its own internal law as justification for failure to carry out an international agreement'. This regime is under obligation by the dictates of the Liberian Constitution which is a replication of international law to adhere to democratic tendencies and respect for its own citizens including those who write and hold critical views. It will be interesting to see which argument the government and its adherent of &quot;sovereignty&quot; will present if we take this matter one step further to halt the undue harassment of the free press before the ECOWAS Court. The SADC Tribunal also cited the case: Spackman v. Plumstead District Board of Works (1885) 10 App Cas 229, 240, in which LordSelborne said: 'There would be no decision within the meaning of the statute if there were anything... done contrary to the essence of justice'. See also Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40.The general obligations of state parties under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, to which the 'democratic' Republic of Liberia is a signatory according to the SADC Tribunal are threefold, namely: to respect, to ensure and to fulfill the rights under international human rights treaties. A state complies with the obligation to respect the recognized rights by not violating them. To ensure is to take the requisite steps, in accordance with its constitutional process and the provisions of relevant treaty (in this case the African Charter), to adopt such legislative or other measures which are necessary to give effect to these rights. To fulfill the rights means that any person whose rights are violated would have an effective remedy as rights without remedies have little value. Article 1 of the African Charter requires states to ensure that effective and enforceable remedies are available to individuals in case of discrimination... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case: Constitutional Rights Project and Others v Federal Republic of Nigeria, communications 140/94, 141/94 145/95 [(2000) AHRLR 227 (ACHPR 1999)] the Africa Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights held at paragraph 174 as follows: &quot;For there to be equal protection of the law, the law must not only be fairly applied but must be seen to be fairly applied. Paragraph 9(3)(a) of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms provides that everyone must be given the right to complain about the policies and actions of individual officials and governmental bodies with regard to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, by petition or other appropriate means, to competent domestic judicial, administrative or legislative authorities or any other competent authority provided for by the legal system of the state, which should render their decision on the complaint without undue delay&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, in the case: Zondi v MEC for Traditional and Local Government Affairs and Others2005 (3) SA 589 (CC). the Constitutional Court of South Africa held at paragraph 82 of the judgment, that &quot;The right of access to the courts is an aspect of the rule of law. And the rule of law is one of the foundational values on which our constitutional democracy has been established. In a constitutional democracy founded on the rule of law, disputes between the state and its subjects, and amongst its subjects themselves, should be adjudicated upon in accordance with law. The more potentially divisive the conflict is, the more important that it be adjudicated upon in court. That is why a constitutional democracy assigns the resolution of disputes to 'a court or, where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum'. It is in this context that the right of access to courts guaranteed by section 34 of the Constitution must be understood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitutional Court further noted that &quot;The right to a fair hearing before an individual is deprived of a right, interest or legitimate expectation is another principle well recognized and entrenched in law. Any existing ouster clause in terms such as 'the decision of the Minister shall not be subject to appeal or review in any court' prohibits the court from re-examining the decision of the Minister if the decision reached by him was one which he had jurisdiction to make. Any decision affecting the legal rights of individuals arrived at by a procedure which offended against natural justice was outside the jurisdiction of the decision-making authority so that, if the Minister did not comply with the rules of natural justice, his decision was ultra vires or without jurisdiction and the ouster clause did not prevent the Court from inquiring whether his decision was valid or not - video Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas v Ryan (1980) AC 718.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on the question of access to a fair and credible judicial process, the Court held that: &quot;The right of access to the courts is also enshrined in international human rights treaties. For instance, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights provides in article 7(1)(a) as follows: Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard. This comprises: (a) The right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental rights... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, this legal opinion is not a suggestion that Liberian courts lack the capacity and judicial competence to provide relief, no far from it. This opinion is intended to highlight the limitations and inadequacies of the type of relief that is available herein in Liberia and that is required to settle the financial expectations of the National Chronicle Newspapers for the damages sustained as a result of the illegal closure order. Therefore, it is my legal advice to you Mr. President, that given the fact that Article 7(1) of the African Charter states that &quot;Every individual shall have the right to have his cause heard&quot; the PUL should now begin to look beyond the relief provided by a petition for a writ of prohibition at the Honorable Supreme Court of Liberia to a greater interest within the province of the EOWAS Community of Justice so as to settle whatever financial claims the Chronicle Newspaper and Mr. Philipbert Browne may have. It is time that we confront the crude and primitive tactics of this regime by the use of our scarce resources and intellects to expose the farce, pretense and duplicity associated with this regime comesticizing press freedom, good governance, rule of law and democracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development planning and service delivery regime in Liberia has largely been haphazard, or poorly coordinated, due primarily to the lack of clear community-based structures that ensure direct popular participation and service trickling or which facilitates bottom to top and top to bottom flow of information and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communities and homes/houses are jumbled up, left without clear or recognizable coordination mechanism and leadership, creating complications not only for development planners and service deliverers to implement their programs, but also in grassroots mobilization and civic participation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight against Ebola seemingly risks futility if nothing is done to first rationalize if not sanitize disorderliness in community formation and population location. A group of Liberians are offering to break the firmly rooted snag that is in wait. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An apparently newly launched group, the Stop Ebola Transmission Initiative (SET), has announced in Monrovia that technical details for the organization, integration and coordination of community-based groups seeking to prevent the transmission of the Ebola Virus in Liberia are concluded. The group said it referenced structure of the community-based effort requires that all communities in Liberia should be enumerated and houses numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the purpose of organizing community residents to take the lead in fighting the Ebola disease, each administrative locality in the country, under the concept, will be divided into zones; each zone further divided into communities; each community will then break down into blocks and neighborhoods; and the houses in the neighborhood are enumerated with no two having the same number. In the rural setting, SET conceptualizes, the neighborhood will be the same as a town or a village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent Liberian, Oscar Cooper, heads SET as its Chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SET concepts refreshes memories of the then popular Liberian NGO, Special Emergency Life Food (SELF) which, as a key partner of the World Food Program during the heydays of the Liberian civil conflict, distributed food supplies to millions of Liberians in urban provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SELF's Community-Driven Structures perhaps for the first time in Liberia delineated communities, enumerated houses and established community leadership democratically chosen by community members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The structures helped family tracing efforts by citizens and NGOs and improved mail delivery system and promoted democratic consciousness and participation. SELF was the concept of Mr. Blamo Nelson, who is now the National Consultant to this national initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently modeling its intervention after the SELF innovation, SET says its strategy is intended to ensure intensive, comprehensive involvement and ownership of the effort to stop Ebola from spreading, as each Neighborhood Monitor will be assigned the task of observing the health status of four houses in his or her immediate neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be &quot;neighborhood monitors&quot; who will be trained and equipped on how to do the daily monitoring and reporting on the health status of the households to the Ebola Control System, SET indicated further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Information provided by the Neighborhood Monitor or anybody who has observed a situation will trigger a response from the Ebola Control system,&quot; said the Liberian group, which added that the enumeration of houses has started and will continue until all houses in Liberia are numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the organization, the number assigned will be a part of a well thought out coding system indicating county, the administrative locality, the community, the neighborhood and the house number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Numbers assigned to houses will make it easier to track and trace case incidents,&quot; SET noted. &quot;It will also facilitate the planning, allocation, targeting and delivery of material and non-material support to individuals and households during the Ebola crisis. Bio-data of each household will be registered in the community directory.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton Global Initiative has donated 100 tons of emergency medical aid to Liberia and Sierra Leone at a value of 5.9 million United States Dollars. The total cargo of 370 pallets will be distributed among the Ministries of Health, National Drug Services, and partner organizations in both countries as well as to the US Centers for Disease Control offices in Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a dispatch from the Liberian Mission in New York, the items in the Clinton Global Initiative's donation include 2.8 million surgical and exam gloves, 170,000 coverall gowns, 120,000 masks, 40,000 liters of pre-mixed oral rehydration solution and 9.8 million defined daily doses of essential medications (generic).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quantities of personal protective equipment (gloves, gowns, masks) included on the flight are sufficient to supply 280 health workers for one year, based on the current requirements and utilization estimates developed in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ceremony to mark the shipment of the emergency medical items was held on Saturday, September 20,2014 at the John F. Kennedy International Airport and was attended by high-level dignitaries from both Liberia and Sierra Leone including Foreign Minister Augustine KpeheNgafuan and Liberia's Ambassador accredited to the United States Jeremiah Sulunteh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making brief remarks during the ceremony, Foreign Minister Ngafuan thanked the Clinton Global Initiative and Direct Relief on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the people of Liberia. He noted that the airlift of critically needed items to Liberia and Sierra Leone (the biggest airlift undertaken by Direct Relief since its founding years ago) will certainly translate into the saving of precious lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the lack of adequate protective equipment has been one of the causes of the death of many health care workers in Liberia; and as such, the huge donation will help in no small way to restore confidence in health care workers and the entire health system. Describing the Ebola Virus Disease as a threat to humankind, Minister Ngafuan called on the global community, especially the private sector of the world to step up and join governments, and international NGOs in taking &quot;bigger, bolder and speedy action&quot; to contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordination of the shipment (flight) is under the auspices of Direct Relief, a non-profit humanitarian aid organization that provides medical assistance to people around the world who have been affected by poverty, natural disasters, and civil unrest. The dispatch disclosed that all of the products included in the cargo, which is expected to arrive in Liberia on Sunday, September 21, 2014, have the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formulation and was approved for importation by the respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Direct Relief has made previous deliveries of 600,000 gloves (300,000 pairs) on four prior air shipments sent by commercial air cargo in July and August (two shipments each to Liberia and Sierra Leone.) In addition, 800,000 gloves (400,000 pairs) were shipped by ocean freight two weeks ago and are enroute. The gloves are in a 40-foot container, two containers each for Liberia and Sierra Leone and are scheduled to arrive on October 16 in Monrovia and Freetown, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, a US -based Non Profit Organization, Good Samaritan Movement has donated a check valued at one thousand Dollars( $1000) and several items of medical supplies to the Government of Liberia to be used in the fight against Ebola. The items which include disinfectants, hand sanitizes, bleach, biohazardbags, among others, were presented to the Foreign Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan at the Liberian Consulate in New York on Friday, September 19, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation, Pastor Nana Frimpong Agyemang said that it was his organization's way of identifying with the people of Liberia in this difficult time as the nation is faced with the worst crisis since the end of the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He prayed that God will alleviate the sufferings of the Liberian people and other countries that have been affected by the Ebola crisis. He explained that the Good Samarian Movement was established to help those in need, especially in the third-world countries with the mission to reach out to less fortunate such as orphans , widows and people with special medical needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the donation on behalf of the Government, Foreign Minister Ngafuan expressed appreciation to the Good Samaritan for the humanitarian gesture and promised to convey the sentiment expressed by the Group to the people and the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that while the friendly nations were forthcoming with big donations, the assistance from individuals and philanthropic organizations were equally appreciated because they all can help in varying ways to boost the fight against the deadly disease. He said if a donation helps to prevent even one more Liberian from dying from Ebola, that donation is a big donation because every Liberian life is precious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Ngafuan expressed thanks to the staff of the Liberian Consulate in New York for helping to coordinate and organized the event. Minister Ngafuan was accompanied by the Liberian Ambassador to Ethiopia, Amb Vivienne Wreh who forms part of the Liberian delegation to the UN General AssemblyMr. George Patten, Minister Counselor for Political Affairs, at the Permanent Mission of Liberia to the UN and Mr. Abu Kamara, Minister Counselor for Press and Public Affairs, at the Permanent Mission of Liberia to UN.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union (EU) says it would rather the world help isolate the Ebola virus disease rather than isolate the affected countries. According to an Executive Mansion release, the Deputy Director-General - Directorate-General Development and Cooperation of EuropeAid (DEVCO), Marcus Conaro, speaking when he met with President Sirleaf during a courtesy call, said this is the time to demonstrate international partnership by giving all the help rather than sitting to witness the death of more people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second condemnation to countries and institutions disengaging from countries affected as the result of the outbreak of the Ebola virus disease. The first came from the current chairman of the sub-regional organization, ECOWAS, also Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama when he paid a solidarity visit to Liberia earlier this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Conaro said the EU, as a long time and a strong partner, will continue to support Liberia in its fight against Ebola as well as its post-Ebola recovery. The Deputy Director-General of EuropeAid said one way the EU has demonstrated its engagement is to keep Brussels Airlines flying to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that as part of the EU's intervention in the Ebola fight, the body will inject an additional five million Euros (<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>5 million) and have already met with the Ugandan General heading the African Union deployment to affected countries, Major-General Dr. Julius Faeki Okettathe, about how it is engaging the Liberian Government to eradicate the killer disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Conaro also committed the EU to supporting Liberia's long term programs, including education, agriculture and economic revitalization and pledged to further push Liberia's case at the United Nation General Assembly in New York. He praised President Sirleaf for the level of leadership demonstrated since the Ebola outbreak terming it as &quot;exemplary&quot;. He admonished her to keep up the extraordinary leadership, she has demonstrated over the years and during this Ebola outbreak in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EuropeAid Deputy Director-General agreed with the government and is equally worried that the Ebola situation would drag development programs, especially the rehabilitation of the Mount Coffee hydro electric plant and Roberts International Airport runway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cornaro assured President Sirleaf that his organization will work with government and other partners to see that these projects are not stalled; and if stalled, resumed as soon as conditions get better as they are greatly important to Liberia's infrastructural development. Responding, President Sirleaf termed Mr. Cornaro's visit representing the European Union as timely and a boost to calls for an end to isolating affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf believed that the visit will help many people who have ostracized affected countries know that there are still safe environments to operate or do their businesses and that there was no need to pack up and leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the cause of the spread of the Ebola virus disease can be attributed to denial and strong family traditions; but assured the EU envoy of government's collaboration with partners that have now taken full control of the situation and are now working to break transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader expressed serious concern about the livelihood of the population, which she said could be affected by the outbreak. She welcomed the EU plan for post-Ebola economic recovery assistance; a plan, she said, Liberia was equally working on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On incentives for health workers, President Sirleaf informed the EU Ambassador that the incentives were now harmonized in line with the sub-region and would be announced soon. The Deputy Director-General - Directorate-General Development and Cooperation -EuropeAid (DEVCO) was accompanied by head of EU Mission in Liberia, Ambassador Attilo Paciffici.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2320 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian government's August 5, 2014 announcement opening the Liberia Basin Bid for four offshore oil blocks has whipped up memories of the series of scandals (howbeit unfounded) that led to the imposition of a moratorium and provided ground for the drafting of a new oil law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it did more than just that: it raised fears of future legal battles that are likely to assail the Liberian economy if the bid proceeds under current quasi-legal frameworks. NOCAL concedes the probable bases of the memory-recalls and the fresh fears, but it dismisses any hard, proven grounds for deep-seated concerns. The Analyst has been looking at the oil company's article on the issue, titled, &quot;Current Oil Bid Round: The Right Step and the Right Time&quot; in light of dissenting background comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL) says that while its August 5, 2014 opening of the Liberia Basin to bidding at this time of national emergency resembles an act of desperation, it is circumspect. The company is therefore, while accommodating certain viewpoints and fears, warning commentators against adjudging the bid round as ill thought or intended to benefit interests other than those of the Liberian people and the nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL's comments were contained in its September 2014 riposte titled, Current Oil Bid Round: The Right Step and the Right Time, which its Public Affairs Division (PAD) released over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company did not say why its riposte was necessary weeks following the announcement. Observers however suppose that the riposte is a likely response to the comments the international consumer watchdog, Global Witness' (GW), made on September 11, 2014 &quot;on the preliminary production sharing contract (PSC) and the August 2014 Liberian oil block bid round&quot;. &quot;But what did it say?&quot; seems the begging question to observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Liberia announced on August 5, 2014 that it was opening the Liberia Basin Bid round for four offshore oil blocks: LB-6, LB-7, LB-16, and LB-17. The Global Witness, like most Liberians and international skeptics, did not take the announcement kindly. In its September 11, 2014 commentary on &quot;the preliminary production sharing contract (PSC) and the August 2014 Liberian oil block bid round&quot; as announced by the Liberian government, the group suggested that the government might be acting in desperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's believed that the government decided to &quot;auction&quot; the four oil blocks because it was &quot;in urgent need of revenue to fight the country's Ebola epidemic&quot;. The group noted that while it was logical to use the country's resources to fight the epidemic, which has to date killed or stigmatized thousands of Liberians and foreign residents, it was an unduly risky kicking of the can down the road - done outside the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GW warned thus, &quot;Safeguards should be included to improve transparency during the bid round, disclose company ownership, ensure information is publicly available during companies' operations, and strengthen human rights protections.&quot; In the group's view, ensuring these safeguards would address fears of wrongdoing because the government had pledged not to award new oil concessions before it had passed a new legislation necessary to regulate the oil sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said even though the government did heed its pledge by drafting new laws, the resulting &quot;Petroleum Exploration and Production Act 2013 (draft Petroleum Act) and the draft National Oil Company of Liberia Act 2013 (draft NOCAL Act) - exist now as bills but have not been enacted by the Liberian Legislature&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group conceded that the government would &quot;seek immediate funds in the form of oil contract signature bonuses in order to provide desperately needed medical supplies, outbreak education materials and health workers is entirely understandable&quot;. It however, contended, &quot;... Awarding oil concessions quickly, and at a time when the government is in crisis is risky. The government's fight against Ebola will limit its capacity to administer the bid round, negotiate with power companies and enforce safeguards such as checking the beneficial owners of companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The outbreak and the rushed nature of the bidding process have also reduced the ability of Liberian civil society groups to provide oversight. This bid round is being led by the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), a quasi-independent agency that is set to lose considerable powers once Liberia's new oil laws are enacted and, as such, may not be the most independent arbiter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, perhaps the largest concern attached to the current Liberian bid round is that it is not guided by a legal framework with modern accountability, governance and transparency safeguards. The draft Petroleum Act and draft NOCAL Act were developed following a lengthy reform and consultation process and contain many such safeguards, but these are not currently in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead, this bid round will principally be governed by the terms of a model production sharing contract, a preliminary draft of which is currently available on the NOCAL website (preliminary PSC), along with the bid documents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group then concluded, &quot;... If Liberia is to maximize the benefit from potential oil discoveries, it should carry out the bid allocation process after the country has adopted the draft oil laws. In light of the country's Ebola epidemic this scenario appears unlikely. As such, it is critical that those documents that will govern the process should contain safeguards to ensure competition and transparency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group closed by proffering corrective recommendations on several aspects of the draft NOCAL bidding regulations, including the preliminary PSC stabilization clause, the pre-qualification criteria, beneficial ownership, transparency of the bidding process, transparency of payments and project documents, and the preliminary PSC provisions on land rights and security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL apparently has no bone to pick with GW's concerns and recommendations or with any other commentator. It in fact embraced the international watchdog group's recommendations. However, it said the problem with GW's comments as with other comments was that they lack a sense of history and perspective, besides being enforced by &quot;emotive rhetoric&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL noted, &quot;Firstly, the debate must understand the historical backdrop of the oil blocks. Two of the oil blocks (Block 16 and 17) were held by Anadarko (an International Oil Company), which subsequently decided to relinquish said blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means that Anadarko stopped all activity and returned the data and the rights to the Government of Liberia-- rendering these two blocks available for other oil companies that may be interested. The other two (Block 6 and 7) were part of the 2007-08 bid round. But discussions with the party granted the right to negotiate over these blocks were terminated, and no contracts were ever concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) attached to these two blocks they were therefore also available to Government to re-open for investment. No exploration or drilling ever took place on any of the four blocks.&quot; NOCAL noted that by insisting that the government was conducting the current round of bidding in error, many Johnny-just-come commentators in the oil sectors were showing a lack of understanding of best acceptable international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Standard petroleum industry practice allows for relinquished blocks to be made available for other oil companies, and that it is bad practice to have previously leased blocks to sit vacant without any activity on them. Indeed, it is good for NOCAL to seek investment in these blocks because doing so will lead to exploration, generate more interest among oil companies and keep our oil sector growing. This is necessary to ensure the potential socioeconomic benefits to Liberia,&quot; the oil company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company explained away suggestions that by opening up new bids before the new oil bills become law, the government was contravening its own moratorium, by noting that such view was not only superficial and trivial, but ill informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It must be understood that the blocks in question lie completely outside of the moratorium that GoL erected around new oil blocks in 2012. This moratorium was put in place to cover virgin acreage that has never been the subject of bid rounds and/or negotiation,&quot; NOCAL said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continued, &quot;The blocks under moratorium are LB-1 through LB-5, and ultra-deep blocks LB-18 through LB-30. Nothing will happen to these blocks and there will be no bid rounds for these blocks until after the new petroleum law is passed and the new regulator is established. Since the four blocks in the bid round (LB-6, LB-7, LB-16, LB-17) have been the subject of earlier bidding and negotiation, which predates the 2012 moratorium, they are not under moratorium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding transparency and the quality of the bid round, NOCAL said it is conducting the bid round with &quot;maximum transparency and maximum resource generation for the country and its people&quot;. This, it said, it did through the hiring of EY (formerly known as Ernst and Young), a leading international consulting and auditing company. EY is mandated under its agreement with the government of Liberia to open the bids and assist with the evaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this round of bidding, according to NOCAL, the government intends to ensure quality bids by ensuring that interested companies pre-qualify. &quot;That means that companies have to prove that they have experience, money and good management to be allowed to bid. Winning companies will have to write their work program, which lays out what they will do,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL said it was in no rush to assign the oil block in bid as critics think, and that therefore it would be circumspect. &quot;The bid round has been meticulously planned and designed with the input from international experts in geology, finance, commercial oil, legal issues, policy and natural resource governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been extensive NOCAL-led discussions with key development partners, including the US Energy Governance Capacity Initiative, AGI, and IMF. There is no question whatsoever that the substance of the contracts or terms on offer will achieve anything less than the best deal for Liberia,&quot; it reiterated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding whether it was acting in desperation, NOCAL noted that the bid round reflected not haste, but &quot;the care and meticulousness&quot;. &quot;It is a matter of fact that the announcement of the process predated the upsurge of the ongoing Ebola situation,&quot; the national oil company said. It however, conceded that the coinciding of the planned bid with the upsurge of the Ebola epidemic provided a unique opportunity for the Liberian government to meet the needs of suffering Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though that was never the intention behind the bid round, the Ebola argument should be turned on its head by pointing out the urgency now to mobilize all national resources (including that of the oil industry) to save the lives of our people, stem the economic damage in the short term and secure our long term ability to recover,&quot; NOCAL said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The long-term future of Liberia cannot be forgotten while dealing with a short-term crisis. But even in the short term this bid round may prove essential for our national stability. The revenues from the investment round could help plug the significant financial hole Ebola leaves in the economy,&quot; NOCAL noted further, as it quoted World Bank statistics on the grim effect the Ebola epidemic was having on the nation's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said besides helping to salvage the Liberian economy, which was facing budget and growth deficits, the current bid round would promote local Liberian business and jobs. &quot;The 'Local Content Participation' (LCP) provision that has been designed, is a world first and will lead to meaningful Liberian participation in the upstream and downstream petroleum sectors,&quot; it said, noting that commentators needed to take time to appreciate fully the facts and the workings of LCP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the scheme in which bidding companies would be required to propose an upfront payment to Liberia, NOCAL said local partnership is encouraged. It said bidding groups would include either a significant West African/ECOWAS upstream petroleum company that has committed to partner with a Liberian company or a direct partnership with a Liberian company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidding companies partnering Liberia companies for a total of a 5% interest would be evaluated as if their upfront payment was 20% higher. &quot;In this way, bidders who partner regionally and/or locally are more likely to win,&quot; NOCAL revealed. This is in addition to the NOCAL participation of 10% and Citizen Participation of 5% for a total Liberian participation of 20%. This is also in addition to the other financial benefits, such as royalty, tax, and production sharing,&quot; the oil company revealed further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the postponement of the bid round, pending the enactment of the oil legislation before the National Legislature, NOCAL said the risk was likely to outweigh the benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the oil and gas industry, it is a bad sign in a country's oil program for previously leased blocks to sit open without any activity. It decreases the value of our existing blocks. It gives the impression that there is no possibility of oil and that no one is interested. What the bid round does is to simply allow qualified oil companies to explore for oil and gas,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil company did not say how this explanation squared with the fears that inadequate law may pit oil explorers against the Liberian government in future legal battles. But it noted, &quot;The Government of Liberia does not have the money or the expertise needed to conduct such activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more oil companies that are looking, the more chances there are to find oil. Liberians should therefore rest assured that the ongoing exercise is being undertaken in the best interest of the country and for the benefit of the generality of all Liberians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone's unprecedented move to sequester its entire population indoors for three days to get to grips with its Ebola epidemic may be extended into this week because volunteers have been unable to visit everyone, officials said last night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's 6 million people were ordered to stay at home from Friday morning so that health workers could educate households about Ebola, which has killed more than 500 people in Sierra Leone and another 2,000 across other west African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lockdown has been unpopular and locals have complained of food shortages and serious economic consequences. But last night, a senior official told Reuters that the exercise might not be over yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a very strong possibility it will be extended,&quot; Stephen Gaojia, head of the Emergency Operations Centre, which leads the national Ebola response, told Reuters after meeting President Ernest Bai Koroma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaojia said 92 bodies had been recovered across the country by the end of Saturday, the second day of the lockdown, and 123 people had contacted the authorities, believing they might be infected. Of these, 56 had tested positive for Ebola, 31 tested negative and 36 were awaiting their results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets of Freetown, the capital, were again mostly deserted yesterday. Sierra Leone's government was hoping the lockdown, the most aggressive containment effort yet attempted, would turn the tide against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miatta Rogers, a mother living in the west of Freetown, said the city's poorer residents generally used the money they earned each day to buy food, making planning for a three-day lockdown impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are not going smooth right now. Everyone is not happy,&quot; she said. &quot;When the government makes a ruling like this, then we all just have to abide by it, but it is not very easy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme provided food packages including rice, beans and porridge throughout the lockdown, although they were not going door to door and were instead focused on serving houses placed under quarantine by medical teams, spokesman Alexis Masciarelli said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency distributed two weeks' worth of rations to 20,000 households in slum communities just before the lockdown, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Turay, a 21-year-old volunteer, said some residents of Bonga Town, a shantytown community near the national stadium in Freetown, and similar communities said the provisions they received were insufficient. &quot;People were saying that, if people are going to lock down for three days, you cannot just leave them like that without food, you have to provide food for them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabarie Fofanah, another volunteer, said some families were refusing food out of fear that it was poisoned. Turay and Fofanah both encountered Freetown residents who feared the soap being distributed by outreach teams was poisoned and potentially lethal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, there was this lady shouting, saying we want to kill her, she is not interested in the soap, we should keep moving,&quot; Fofanah said. &quot;We tried our level best to talk to her but she refused to take the soap. She is afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN is grappling with crises on every level and Ukraine is poisoning the organisation,&quot; said Richard Gowan, at the Centre on International Cooperation at New York University. &quot;It does feel like a particularly dreadful year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one exception to the confrontational climate at the security council this year has been its deliberations on fighting the Ebola virus. The council made history last week, passing a resolution declaring Ebola a threat to international peace and security, and calling on countries to send medical workers and supplies to combat it. The UN established an emergency mission to contain the spread of the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. There will be an emergency meeting on implementation this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola represents an opportunity for the UN,&quot; Gowan said. &quot;There are no conflicting interests. There is no pro-Ebola faction. It's a classic international problem requiring a common response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban is seeking a similarly common response to another longstanding international challenge - climate change - but with significantly less success. The general debate is starting a day later than usual this year, on Wednesday, so that the world's leaders can attend a global summit on the issue tomorrow. But the leaders of Russia, India and China will not be attending, claiming other commitments. The actor Leonardo DiCaprio, named the latest UN &quot;messenger for peace&quot; on climate change, will address the summit, but his star power is unlikely to make up the gaping hole in international commitment on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Syria, the task of building a political and military coalition against the Islamic State (Isis) extremist group has been done outside the framework of the UN. A security council meeting will not address the role of the regime in Damascus, which is still responsible for far more civilian deaths than Isis, according to Human Rights Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one chink of light also seems less bright 12 months on. The last-minute mobile phone conversation in 2013 between President Barack Obama and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, as the latter drove to the airport, boosted hopes of a historic thaw in relations. There was a breakthrough interim deal in November on Iran's nuclear programme, freezing it in return for relaxation of western sanctions. However, progress towards a more comprehensive agreement has been faltering. &quot;Even optimists recognise prospects are dimming for a comprehensive nuclear deal between Iran and the west,&quot; Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council, told Foreign Policy magazine. &quot;Simply put, Iran can afford to say no to a deal that doesn't meet its bottom line.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mano River Women Peace Network (MARWOPNET) has begun collaborating with 20 civil society organizations in creating cross-border awareness in response to the national call for collective action in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting some Ebola material to MARWOPNET-Liberia Board members on last week Friday, the 2nd Regional Vice President, Amelia Ward said the outbreak of the Ebola virus has negatively impacted the successful programs implemented in the past to empower members in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founding member Ward said women are the primary healthcare givers and that it is observed that the outreach teams are not receiving the full cooperation for the transfer of suspected patients to the treatment center thereby spreading the virus because of mistrust, fear and inefficient information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it is also observed that awareness messages in bordering communities are still inefficient especially the porous borders and family ties in those communities and expressed special thanks to the LPRC and Kvinna Till Kvinna (KTK) for the support provided to MARWOPNET to launch its awareness on Ebola to bordering communities in Nimba, Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, Bo Sierra Leone, Gbarpolu and rural Montserrado Counties. MARWOPNET's National Focal Point, Ruth Caesar, said her organization started its awareness campaign since April in Voinjama, Lofa County where a whole session was conducted on the Ebola awareness and quality sensitization was carried out with the understanding that Ebola broke out in Liberia since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said they could not continue due to lack of funding to carry out massive awareness and KTK and LPRC accepted to assist in that direction because of the needs they had especially in the areas they cover and that will be basically along the borders in seven communities in each of those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said because of their programs, their campaign will be extended into the neighboring countries and that is why they have placed so much emphasis on the importance of continuing the awareness to encourage the peaceful co-existence and this will last for three to four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Constitution Review Committee, Gloria Musu Scott said the Ebola attack is not only on the human bodies, health and existence but it has also embarrassed the citizens' 'Liberianess' which can describe Liberians as being 'indiscipline' when it comes to their interaction with each other and foreigners as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Scott said Ebola is an individualistic virus that has attacked families and is crippling the economy and everything that involves family values and has become a worldwide attack that requires collective action. She expressed gratitude to the healthcare workers for their unflinching services as well as the international community for their valuable support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Field Representative of the KTK, Anne-Marie Lukowski added that this fight against the virus is now in communities and eventually it will be overcome as it is just a matter of time noting that something good will come out of the fight against Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, one of MARWOPNET's founding members, Mary Brownell said much has been placed in the fight against the Ebola virus and urged everyone to call on God, put Him first adding, &quot;If we pray sincerely, God will answer us. He cannot let us down.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the deadly Ebola virus rages on in the country, Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has visited several health facilities in Grand Bassa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit of the Liberian leader is to get first-hand information at the various health facilities in Bassa about the precarious situation that has befallen the country. Madam Sirleaf said her visit was to acquaint herself with situations affecting those at the health centers in Grand Bassa and other parts of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has the highest number of deaths so far from the Ebola epidemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf on Thursday, visited several parts of Grand Bassa County and health centers in the county. Some of the places visited by the Liberian leader include, Bokay Town, Dowein, Barclayville, the Diahn Pleh Holding Center near Compound #1, the Lloydsville Health Center and the St John Clinic in Fortsville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other areas visited by Madam Sirleaf were the St Peter Claver Health Center in the port city of Buchanan, the former LAMCO Hospital now ArcelorMittal Health Center and the Liberian Government Hospital in central Buchanan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the various health centers in Grand Bassa County, the President lauded health workers for their sacrificial services to humanity promising that Government will do everything possible to meet some of their immediate needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her visit, the President and her entourage distributed some Personal Protection Equipment (PPEs) and assorted items for health workers at the various health centers in Bassa. President Sirleaf assured that Ebola will end in Liberia reminding the citizens to follow the measures by the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pres. Sirleaf used the visit to thank private health institutions that include the Catholic Hospital in Buchanan and the ArcelorMittal Health Center in the port city that are assisting with the fight of the Ebola virus. She also lauded the staff at the Liberian Government Hospital for their continuous efforts in eradicating the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lauded the staff of the various health centers for their commitment at the time when the nation is facing its difficulties. In spite of the difficulties, President Sirleaf added that Liberia will overcome the ongoing Ebola epidemic with the help of partners who are assisting the Liberian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the County Health Officer of Grand Bassa, Dr. Joseph Kekura has disclosed that at least 21 persons have died from the deadly Ebola virus in the county. Dr. Kekura further disclosed that there are 44 confirmed cases of the Ebola virus saying that District#1 and two are the most affected areas in Grand Bassa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Bassa County Health Officer also pointed out that among the 21 deaths, sixteen died in various communities while six died in hospital. He said the situation indicates that the community structure needs to be strengthened and a robust contact tracing be put into place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kekura said among challenges facing the county are that the referral system is non-functional; the construction of an Ebola Center in the county due to the over crowdedness of assisting treatment centers in the county; the inadequacy of ambulances in Grand Bassa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants the provision of four new ambulances in various places in Bassa to quickly respond to the Ebola crisis. Dr. Kekura also called for support to the burial team in terms of vehicles and other equipment to enhance the work of health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has presented a brand new vehicle to the Liberian Government Hospital in Buchanan City, Grand Bassa County. The Pick-up is to be used by authorities of the hospital as it continues to fight against the Ebola virus. The pick-up was made available by the Fula Community in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union has reiterated its commitment to providing the amount of US$ 181 million in package of funding to the countries affected with the Ebola virus in West Africa, most of which will be used in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing journalists last Friday which climaxed the delegation's visit to Liberia as a mark of the EU's citizens' solidarity towards the EU funded actions and engagement on the Ebola situation in the country, the head of EU's high level visiting delegation, Marcus Cornaro said there is only one system in this fight and pledged the EU's commitment to supporting this one system in eradicating the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised that all EU's current and planned financed development cooperation actions will remain in place which include ongoing programs in areas such as budget support, infrastructure, health and forestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's Deputy Director General for Development Cooperation also said EU is still committed to making available some $ 279 million Euros over the next seven years against its planned new programs in the education, energy, governance and agricultural sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the EU's support to Liberia has so far focused on providing financial means for the daily frontline agencies like Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the International Federation of Red Crescent Societies (ICRC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in its fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing EU's support, Mr. Cornaro outlined an additional payment of about US$ 10 million recently provided the Liberian government as direct budgetary support and that would be followed by others up to a total of US$ 65 million to mitigate the impact on government's finances due to the loss of revenue caused by the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed how his delegation had met with top government officials and held discussion on how the EU will roll out quickly additional support due in for 2014/15, and explained more in detail the types of Ebola assistances his organization will bring to the country and how it will engage in carrying out some of the programs already ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by Dr. Philippe Maughan, Director General of ECHO Humanitarian Aid, Mr. Cornaro told reporters that the international community has a role to play because if they are to help to contain something it should only be the disease not to contain or stigmatize the population affected or to stigmatize or isolate communities or individuals affected noting that it is the wrong message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the EU's West African package will be divided into three categories and that includes $ 38 Euros going toward strengthening healthcare systems, food security, water and sanitation, $ 5 million for mobile laboratories for the detection of the virus and training health care workers and $ 97. 5 million will be spent for budget support operations in Liberia and Sierra Leone to reinforce governments' capacity in delivering public service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its bid to help Liberians kick out this deadly Ebola virus in Liberia, and save thousands of people lives, Plan International Liberia last week Saturday, September 20, 2014 took truck load of preventive Ebola materials to the government Hospital in Bomi County, as part of showing humanitarian concern to those who have been affected by the virus in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presentation was done in the presence of County officials including Superintendent Samuel Brown, the head of the County Health Team, Dr. Gabriel Gorbee Logan, the World Health Organization Technical Assistant to the County, Dr. Richard Luce, Ms. Frances Alesi, Acting Head of UNMIL field office in the county, and Borma Q.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items presented to the County Superintendent for onward presentation to the head of the County health team included 130 buckets with faucets, 15 gallons of chloride, 6 buckets of 45kg chlorine, 80 bottles of hand sanitizer, 15 barrels with faucets, 30 rubber buckets without faucets, 3 dozens of tissues, 25 bottles of liquid washing soap, 150 pcs of t-shirts with 150 caps and awareness printing materials estimated at US$12,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some speakers during the presentation congratulated the management team of Plan Liberia International for its significant contribution made to the county, and urged other people to follow their footstep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few weeks ago, similar donations including vehicles were presented to the Liberian Government through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare totaling more than $84,000 U.S.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the increasing rate in this vicious Ebola virus in the country, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has made a passionate plea with citizens of Grand Bassa County to stop getting on mats to mourn the dead ones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf who visited health facilities in Grand Bassa County last week informed the Bassa citizens that Ebola is real and is claiming hundreds of lives in the country and as such Bassonians must stop touching dead bodies or getting together in huge numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you very much for following the measures by washing your hands and other measures announced by the Ministry of Health but I'm here to plead with you to stop the 'mat business' small until we can fight this Ebola virus,&quot; the Liberian leader pleaded with the citizens in Jonnie Town, Dowein Town, Grand Bassa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said the virus is devastating every fabric of the society including the loss of lives and at the same time ravaging the economy of the nation. She called on Bassonians to relax some of the traditional practices including getting on mats as a means of mourning their dead relatives and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, Bassonians, like other Kwa-speaking groups including Kru and Grebo, are better known for spending times on mats to mourn their dead ones. They are also known for bathing (washing) dead bodies as part of traditional rites which were long practised by their ancestors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, a tiny West African nation that had emerged from a 14-year of devastating civil conflict is facing its worst times as the Ebola pestilence rages on in the country. The country has recorded the highest number of deaths amongst the three West African Countries that are most affected by the epidemic in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus is not just a public health crisis. It has also become a social crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis, and a threat to national security beyond the outbreak zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf as head of the National Task Force on Ebola has begun visiting health facilities across the country with her latest visit to Grand Bassa County over the weekend. The President used the occasion to appreciate health workers who are sacrificing for the sake of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She distributed personal items to health workers and Personal Protective Equipment to the various health centers in the county. Pres. Sirleaf also turned over a brand new vehicle to the Liberia Government Hospital in Buchanan to strengthen the fight against the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the potential threat that the Ebola virus poses to the existence of human beings in the country the Villagers over the weekend began a door-to-door Ebola awareness campaign in the Kebbeh Community outside the Bardnersville Estate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the launch of the awareness campaign, Madam Dee-Zoe Lake, Founder of the organization disclosed that the group was established six years ago purposely to cater to the needs of the elderly in society. Madam Lake said the fight against the deadly Ebola virus requires concerted efforts of every segment of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this backdrop, Madam Lake said the Villagers has decided to carry out Ebola awareness from door-to-door intended to sensitize the old people about the universal precautionary measures which she described as regular hand-washing, not to touch dead bodies and to be aware of symptoms such as severe headache, vomiting including running stomach among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She reminded residents of the community that it is important for the old folks to be knowledgeable about the disease because the old folks are the ones who remain at home with the children daily.The Founder of the Villagers Inc., also intimated that her organization will use the various Liberian vernaculars when carrying out the exercise so that the message can be understood in order for them to also pass it on to the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will give one Ebola bucket, Clorax, soap as well as rice with little cash as our own way of identifying with the old folks during this health crisis,&quot; Madam Lake said.Speaking further, the founder of the organization pointed out that the Villagers Incorporated intends to carry out the campaign weekly with the availability of needed resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receiving his bucket and other sanitary materials from the Villagers Inc., OldmanTinko Borbor said, &quot;This is the bucket I've been looking for; thank God for the women.&quot; At the end of the exercise, those who were sensitized expressed gratitude to the women for the initiatives and urged them to continue the good work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, Sodey C. Lake, a member of the organization emphasized that the old people can also play a pivotal role in eradicating the pestilence from the land. The Directress of Nursing at the Jackson F. Doe Memorial Regional Referral Hospital in Tappita, Nimba County stated that the Villagers Incorporated was contemplating on taking the Ebola awareness at a district level in the county and to also make it a national effort so as to benefit others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She however paid homage to President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf whom she said visited the Villagers and took a membership card thus declaring her membership to the organizationfor her support in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sodey Lake also expressed gratitude to Vice President, Joseph Boakai, the Managing Director of NASSCORP, Dewitt Von Ballmoos, Momo Bright also of NASSCORP as well as Board Member Bobby Brown of the Villagers Incorporated and all Villagers who made contributions toward the success of the awareness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pastor of the St. Kizito Catholic Church in the Outland Community in Paynesville, Father Foday Kromah has called on fellow men of God to stop laying hands as a means of healing persons suspected of Ebola. Father Kromah made the assertion on Sunday when the Church commissioned at least 16 persons to serve on the Church's Ebola Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioning the 16-member committee, Father Foday Kromah cautioned the Task Force to get prepared for a much tougher challenge; meaning, there lies ahead of them greater challenges of criticism from people. &quot;Today, in a small but solemn manner we launch the St. Kizito Parish Ebola Response Initiative, 'Phase Two' which focuses on going beyond the confines of our Parish, the Outland Community,&quot; Father Kromah stated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Kromah who appeared very humble on the occasion also pleaded with those Pastors and Imams who said laying hands on the sick, anointing people's heads with hands and bathing of dead bodies as prayer for sick persons to at least desist. According to him, such behaviors are contrary to those preventive health tips outlined by health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Father Kromah, Ebola is not a curse from God. &quot;To my venerable Christian Pastors, be you men of God and Women of God, I beg you in the Name of Jesus, the greatest healer that ever walked the face of the earth; please stop laying hands on people in order to cure them of Ebola,&quot; Father Kromah stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said doing so will further put God to test and could destroy the much needed united effort required in the fight against the Ebola virus. &quot;To our venerable Imams, I respectfully appeal to you in the name of Allah, the most gracious and most merciful; please stop bathing dead bodies, let us all agree to let go of all religious practices that are putting us at risk,&quot; Father Kromah stated further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sisters and brothers, may we all, regardless of our faith and religious orientations, continue to unite in the effort to defeat the deadly Ebola virus from our country. Yes, we can do this if we all personally and conscientiously adhere to those preventive measures as advised by the health workers,&quot; Father Kromah averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking later, two officials of the Task Force lauded the contributions made by fellow Parishners in the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus. Madam Mai B. Urey said the fight against the virus should be seen as a collective effort. &quot;There should be a new approach in the fight, simply leaving from mere speaking to taking actions that are needed to benefit those communities,&quot; Mrs. Urey stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should be a change in the fight against the Ebola virus, and that fight should start with everyone; this is our own fight in the Ebola crisis, and that change should start with every one of us,&quot; Mrs. Urey stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have designed a new approach; the Ebola Prevention and Home Care Management; we are going to train about fifteen Parishners and group them in five; we have contacted the World Health Organization (WHO) to urgently train these young Parishners who will be deployed in the Outland Community to carry on'door to door' awareness,&quot; Madam Urey averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Official, Mr. Amos Brosius lauded the efforts of fellow Parishners for their contributions and also called on them to do more as the fight will solicit more supports. According to Mr. Brosius, the Church was not in annoyance to the needs of the community. He said the Church will begin its campaign in the Outland Community and later extend to other communities if the need arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Outland Community Chairman, Mr. Joseph S. Freeman, has welcomed the latest move by the Church in carrying on awareness in the Community. He however made a personal donation of 20 buckets and some Clorax as his initial contribution and promised to join the campaign by organizing men to work along with the Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those commissioned were Mrs. Violet Wilson-Flomo, Mr. Felix Saint-Jean, Dr. Robert Dolo, Mr. Foday Kanneh, Ms. Torlu Kollie, Mr. Sabato Neufville, Mr. Wilson T. Nyanneh, Mr. Thomas Williams, Mrs. Precious Dennis and Mr. Thomas Norris. Others are, Mr. Joseph Tellewoyon, Mr. Arthur Douglas, Mr. Amos Brosius, and Advisor to the Committee; Mrs. Mai B.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation over the weekend at the newly furbish Island Clinic, the Chair Person of the Board Madam Lowpu Kandakai stress that her organization was here to help President Sirleaf in the fight against epidemic that is taking the lives of Liberians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwin G. Wandah</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1043 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank Group analysis finds that if the Ebola virus continues to surge in the three worst-affected countries - Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone - its economic impact could grow eight-fold, dealing a potentially catastrophic blow to the already fragile states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the analysis finds that economic costs could be limited if swift national and international responses succeed in containing the epidemic and mitigating &quot;aversion behavior&quot; - a fear factor resulting from peoples' concerns about contagion, which is fueling the economic impact.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said, &quot;The primary cost of this tragic outbreak is in human lives and suffering, which has already been terribly difficult to bear. But our findings make clear that the sooner we get an adequate containment response and decrease the level of fear and uncertainty, the faster we can blunt Ebola's economic impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen in recent days a serious scaling up on the part of international donors to contain the Ebola epidemic. Today's report underscores the huge potential costs of the epidemic if we don't ramp up our efforts to stop it now,&quot; President Kim stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the World Bank analysis, two alternative scenarios to estimate the medium-term impact of the epidemic to the end of 2015,'A Low Ebola scenario envisions rapid containment within the three core countries, while &quot;High Ebola&quot; corresponds to the upper ranges of current epidemiological estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated impact on output individually and in aggregate, in the short term (2014) and medium term (2015, Low Ebola), medium-term impact (2015 - High Ebola) with Guinea $130 million (2.1 pp) $43 million (1.0 pp) and $142 million (2.3 pp).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia $66 million (3.4 pp), $82 million (4.2 pp),and $228 million (11.7 pp) while Sierra Leone $163 million (3.3 pp) $59 million (1.2 pp)and $439 million (8.9 pp) the Core three countries, $359 million $97 million $809 million with entries in US dollars (percentage of GDP in brackets).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis estimates the short-term impact on output to be 2.1 percentage of GDP in Guinea, reducing growth from 4.5 percent to 2.4 percent; 3.4 percentages in Liberia which was also reduced at a growth from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent; and 3.3 percentages in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also reduced in growth from 11.3 percent to 8 percent, with forgone output corresponding to $359 million in 2014 prices. However, according to the World Bank, if the virus is not contained, these estimates may rise to $809 million in the three countries alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just in Liberia alone, the hardest hit country, the High Ebola scenario sees output hit to increase at an alarming rate of 11.7 percentage in 2015, reducing growth from 6.8 percent to -4.9 percent). But the short-term fiscal impacts will also be large, at $93 million for Liberia (4.7 percent of GDP); $79 million for Sierra Leone (1.8 percent of GDP); and $12 million for Guinea (1.8 percent of GDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slow containment gaps would almost certainly lead to even greater financing gaps in 2015, the analysis finds. Inflation and food prices were initially contained but are now rising in response to shortages, panic buying, and speculations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although, families are already vulnerable to food price shocks, becoming increasingly exposed, exchange rate volatility has increased in all three countries, particularly since June, fueled by uncertainty and some capital flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis finds that the largest economic effects of the crisis are not as a result of the direct costs (mortality, morbidity, care-giving, and the associated losses to working days), have contributed immensely, resulting from aversion behavior driven by fear of contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, this leads to a fear of association with others and reduces labor force participation, closes places of employment, disrupts transportation, and motivates some government and private decision-makers to close sea ports and airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the recent history of infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004 and the H1N1 flu epidemic of 2009, the analysis notes that behavioral effects have been responsible for as much as 80-90 percent of the total economic impact of the epidemics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings of the analysis underlined the need for a concerted international response. External financing is clearly needed in the three core countries, and the impact estimates suggest that containment and mitigation expenditures as high as several billion dollars would be cost-effective if they successfully avert the worst scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analysis described four related activities such a response, at least to include Humanitarian support, as desperately needed personal protective equipment and hazard pay for health workers, emergency treatment units, standardized and universally applied protocols for care, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Fiscal support, just for 2014, is estimated at around $290 million. Increased injections of external support can strengthen growth in these fragile economies. Screening facilities at Airports and Seaports, policies are required that will enable the flow of relief and encourage commercial exchange with the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With strengthening the surveillance, detection, and treatment capacity of African Health Systems, weak health sectors in Africa are a threat not only to their own citizens but also to their trading partners and the world at large, the enormous economic cost of the current outbreak could be avoided by prudent ongoing investment in health system strengthening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With serious attention to the fight, the World Bank Group's Ebola Response is mobilizing a $230 million financing package for the three countries hardest hit by the Ebola crisis, which will help contain the spread of infections, help communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis, and improve public health systems throughout West Africa. The World Bank Group is supporting country responses in line with the WHO Roadmap, and is coordinating assistance closely with the UN and other international and country partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of mid-September 2014, of the pledged $230 million, the WBG has mobilized $117 million for the emergency response, which includes IDA grants of $58 million for Liberia, $34 million for Sierra Leone, and $25 million for Guinea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Epidemiology Survey conducted by National Ebola Task Force has revealed that more men are being infected by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) than women within the thirty first, thirty second and thirty three weeks of the menace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the National Ebola Case Management Team and Assistant Minister of Health for Preventive Services, Mr. Tolbert Nyenswah, told journalists at yesterday's edition of the Special Ebola Press Briefing that seventy percent of men had been infected in the three weeks which falls in the month of August as compared to thirty percent of women that were infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyesnwah said as of yesterday, Montserrado County still tops the Ebola infection chart followed by Lofa and Margibi Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah explained that the survey's finding revealed that between the ages of 25 to 34 are highly infected with the EBOLA Virus Disease with the ages of 35 to 40m being the second most infected and ages 45 to 54 being the third most infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyeswah who displayed the chart of the Epidemiology Survey but could not release same to journalists said, children less than five years and adults over 60 years are the less affected by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyenswah, a preventive Health Service specialist, further indicated that among health workers operating in the country, nurses and Nurse Aids are the most affected while doctors and Physician Assistants have the lower affected rate of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touching on the most affected areas in Montserrado County, Minister Nyeswah said Caldwell, New Kru Town, several parts of Bushrod Island and West Point are seriously affected, a reason for which the Island Clinic was opened last Sunday for the treatment of Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said since the opening of the 150 beds in Island Clinic last Sunday, the facility has admitted 112 patients with about 56 Ebola patients being transferred from the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tolbert Nyenswah further said 49 out of the 112 patients were tested Negative for Ebola but are being monitored and being treated for Malaria, fever, running stomach and other sicknesses. &quot;We are monitoring them and there will be another Ebola test on them within the next 48 hours,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said of the patients at the Island Clinic, 56 of them are Ebola positive and are receiving treatment and being catered to by the over 75 medical team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah unveiled that in thirty day's time the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) at the New Defense Ministry in Congo Town will be opened; stressing that Government's plan is to erect 17 ETU throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah dispelled rumors that the United States Marines had examined and discharged several Ebola suspects in the country and that there were only two cases of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, he noted that the government of Liberia (GOL) is discharging many person from the Ebola centers after they have been treated, saying, &quot;We discharged 14 persons from the JFK Memorial Hospital that were infected but later proved negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly six months after the first case of Ebola in West Africa was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN General Assembly and the Security Council have approved resolutions creating the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) to contain the ongoing outbreak which has sickened more than 5,500 people and killed over 2,500.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not just a public health crisis. This is a social crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis, and a threat to national security well beyond the outbreak zones,&quot; said Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General to the UN Security Council Thursday. &quot;For these reasons, Mr. Secretary-General and I are calling for a UN-wide initiative that draws together all the assets of all relevant UN agencies,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first time in history that the United Nations has created a mission for a public health emergency.The Mission will bring together the vast resources of the United Nations agencies, funds and program, to reinforce WHO's technical expertise and experience in disease outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While WHO plays a central role in leading the public health efforts for this response, the support of other United Nations agencies is essential to deal with the social, economic, development and security challenges that are affecting these countries and the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This unprecedented outbreak requires an unprecedented response,&quot; said Dr. David Nabarro, the UN Secretary General's Senior Coordinator for the Ebola Response. &quot;The numbers of cases have doubled in these countries in the last three weeks. To get in front of this, the response must be a 20-fold increase from where it is today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mission will immediately begin to pull together the assets from the relevant agencies and will create a hub in Accra, Ghana, and will work closely with the UN agencies and the Governments in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">581 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINCE THE OUTBREAK of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the country in March of this year, residents and citizens alike have been undergoing strong degree of hardship as the scourge continues to defy family traditions and other cultural practices very common to the hospitable people of Liberia. It has gone to the level where members of a family or love ones can no longer cater to their sick or dead relatives for fear of being infected with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS SERIOUSLY a peculiar situation which is devastating families, communities and every affected Ebola terrain in the country. Although to the displeasure of all, this is now becoming the order of the day as several family members sit sadly only to see their love ones die and be cremated something which is very hurtful and abnormal to the cultural practices of the Liberian people which are deeply rooted in the rich African Cultural heritage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEDICAL EXPERTS WHO are knowledgeable of the virus have advised that people must not touch their sick and dead love ones or risk being infected with the virus. With agony people are now abiding with this advice even though it is very inflexible to accept but whatever it may be, we all have seen the danger ignoring this advice has caused to families, communities and our country. Indeed the danger is that over a thousand of our citizens have succumbed to the disease especially during the past months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECONDLY, CALLING FOR an ambulance to remove a sick or dead person in recent time though improving at a slow pace, is still a difficult task as calls after calls for the removal of a dead person remains a task that can sometime take two to three days. Now there are reports that whenever the burial team comes to remove a dead or sick person for cremation or treatment, they at times demand for money to execute the task for which they are being paid. This attitude is obstinate and must be condemned in the strongest term. Again maybe agreeing to the payment which sometime leads to the release of the body to the family should also be stopped as it has the propensity of further spreading the Ebola virus especially when no test is taken as to the cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANOTHER PROBLEM WHICH is also creeping into the society as the result of this Ebola epidemic is the attitude of people stigmatizing their friends, family members and others who have survived the disease and discharged from treatment centers. When the two Americans who were infected with the virus in Liberia were flown home to the United States, treated and discharged from Hospital, they were never stigmatized by their friends, family members or love ones. They were accepted and embraced because they are clear of the disease. Why can't we follow this example and accept our friends, love ones and family members when they are cleared of the virus?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS THIS number of hurtful developments which include stigmatization, demanding money for rendering service to affected persons that are of serious concern to us. If we must win this fight and defeat Ebola throughout the length and breadth of Liberia and beyond our borders,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THEREFORE, WE MUST be our brothers' keepers by exhibiting the spirit of care, concern and true brotherliness. Whatever may be, this situation must not kill our human spirit but strengthen our resolve to keep our families, society and national heritage intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LET'S TRULY BE our brothers' keepers; fight this virus in a holistic manner while remaining united as a people and we will triumph.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight members of a team trying to raise awareness about Ebola have been killed by villagers using machetes and clubs in Guinea, officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the bodies - of health workers, local officials and journalists - were found in a septic tank in a village school near the city of Nzerekore.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondents say many villagers are suspicious of official attempts to combat the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,600 people have now died from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the world's worst outbreak of Ebola, with officials warning that more than 20,000 people could ultimately be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbouring Sierra Leone has begun a controversial three-day curfew to try to stop the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team disappeared after being pelted with stones by residents when they arrived in the village of Wome - in southern Guinea, where the Ebola outbreak was first recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A journalist who managed to escape told reporters that she could hear villagers looking for them while she was hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government delegation, led by the health minister, had been dispatched to the region but they were unable to reach the village by road because a main bridge had been blocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday night, government spokesman Albert Damantang Camara said the victims had been &quot;killed in cold blood by the villagers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bodies showed signs of being attacked with machetes and clubs, officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six people have been arrested and the village is now reportedly deserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motive for the killings has not been confirmed, but the BBC's Makeme Bamba in Guinea's capital, Conakry, says many villagers accuse the health workers of spreading the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others still do not believe that the disease exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, riots erupted in Nzerekore, 50 km (30 miles) from Women, after rumours that medics who were disinfecting a market were contaminating people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strictly Come Dancing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBC ONE, 9.00PM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the reassuringly good launch show three weekends ago (when a celebrity line up that looked shabby on paper turned out to be more promising in the flesh), it is at last time to discover what the intervening 21 days of training with their professional partners has done for our wannabe dancing stars. Speaking of wannabes, arch rival The X Factor is looking like a sulky teenager by bringing its bootcamp edition forward to the same time slot, just for the sake of sticking up two fingers. But enough of such silliness. The big question is which of Strictly's 15 hopefuls will strike us as having the legs, grace, charm and untapped terpsichorean talent to win the glitterball this year, and who will look doomed to crash, burn and take a quickstep out of the competition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judging by their displays of creaky dad dancing in the launch show, Gregg Wallace and Tim Wonnacott have got to be the likeliest for an early bath, while tennis mum Judy Murray and Mrs Brown's missus Jennifer Gibney look like they could be competing for who can deliver most foot faults. As ever, there will be no public vote or elimination this weekend, to allow the celebrities to find their feet dancing in public, although the judges' votes will count towards next week's elimination. Expect pop princesses Pixie Lott and Frankie Bridge, singer Simon Webbe and former Scottish rugby international Thom Evans to be the least concerned about that at this stage. Continues tomorrow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unreported World: Surviving Ebola</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHANNEL 4, 7.30PM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new series returns with an upsetting look at the Ebola outbreak that is devastating Sierra Leone. &quot;Ebola is the family destroyer,&quot; shouts a local nurse giving out leaflets in the street. It's a fact that becomes all too clear as reporter Shaunagh Connaire and crew spend two weeks in field hospitals and quarantine units, surrounded by the casualties of the virus, who are often heartbreaking young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The X Factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITV, 9.00PM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Strictly temporarily shifts its contest to tonight (see What to Watch, above), so The X Factor adds a third show to its weekly schedule in an attempt to weaken the dance contest's ratings. This first instalment sees the beginning of boot camp, and the return of the cruel &quot;six-chair challenge&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gogglebox</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHANNEL 4, 9.00PM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of the Bafta-winning show which has been a surprise success. Viewers across the country will gather round their TV sets to watch a selection of viewers across the country watching their own TVs. Our favourite Gogglers are set to return, including the posh, sloshed Steph and Dom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Graham Norton Show</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBC ONE, 10.35PM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talk show returns for its 16th series. Together on Graham Norton's sofa in this first episode are Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington, the acclaimed new Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, and actress Gemma Arterton. Meanwhile, there's music from singersongwriter George Ezra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later... with Jools Holland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBC TWO, 11.05PM; WALES, 12.35AM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight, Jools Holland is joined by two familiar faces: queen of soul Mary J Blige and Sixties singer Marianne Faithfull. There are debut performances, too, from dark rock trio Band of Skulls and Swedish sisters First Aid Kit. Also, actor Idris Elba chats about his new musical project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH chiefs in Sierra Leone ordered the entire population to stay indoors yesterday as they began a three-day &quot;lockdown&quot; to try to bring the country's Ebola outbreak into check.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fearful that many of those infected are choosing to hide in their homes rather than report for treatment, 30,000 volunteer health workers began a door-to-door education campaign aimed at visiting every home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversial programme, backed by security forces, confines the country's six million residents to their homes until midnight tomorrow. Although the volunteers are not instructed to enter people's homes, they are expected to call the emergency services if they suspect anyone is harbouring an Ebola sufferer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid agencies have clashed over the effectiveness of the scheme, with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res saying it risks antagonising the public, who are already angry at the health authorities' slow response to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But UNICEF, the UN children's agency, which is funding most of the &pound;1million operation, said it would reinforce messages about how to avoid getting Ebola. &quot;We have been sending life saving messages through radio, TV and print, but it's not enough,&quot; said Roeland Monasch, Unicef's local representative. &quot;We need to take information to where people are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ernest Bai Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, who launched the campaign in a televised address to the nation, said: &quot;These are extraordinary times and extraordinary times require extraordinary measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is mounting public pressure to tackle the Ebola epidemic, which has now killed more than 2,600 across west Africa - 550 of them in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In neighbouring Liberia yesterday, US military aircraft brought the first members of a team that will supervise the 3,000-strong military force pledged by President Barack Obama this week to help build 17 extra Ebola clinics across Liberia, the worst-hit nation so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Germany and France yesterday agreed a joint airlift to send aid supplies to affected countries, while Britain is funding the construction of a treatment clinic in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Distrust of medical staff, who have sometimes been accused of spreading the virus themselves, remains a major problem throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday, eight health education workers were found dead in a village in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the warnings that the programme could backfire, the first day of Sierra Leone's lockdown appeared to go relatively smoothly, with the bustling capital, Freetown, becoming a ghost town overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Houses visited by the health workers were given a sticker to display, as well as detergents and information leaflets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everyone seems to be complying and this is very good,&quot; said Francis Munu, a Freetown police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steven Gaojia, who is coordinating the shutdown, said that 258 extra beds had been set up in makeshift treatment centres across Freetown in anticipation of the discovery of dead bodies and new cases in people's homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So far the most frequently asked questions to our team have been about stigmatisation and untested drugs,&quot; added Francis Coker, a health volunteer. &quot;It shows that people are aching for a cure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dramatic measures came as the United Nations said the outbreak, which has infected 5,300 people, largely in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, was a threat to world peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers have struggled to stem the spiralling numbers of victims as residents in rural areas have fled or attacked them. On Thursday nine members of an education team in Guinea were found with slit throats after panicked residents thought they had come to attack them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 30,000 volunteers have been trained to hand out soap and raise awareness in the campaign, known locally as &quot;hose to hose tok&quot; (house-to-house talk), but there were delays across the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We volunteers have been waiting since 7am, but the health officials haven't come yet. We're ready to go, we want this Ebola to end, but the planning has not been the best,&quot; said Ade Kamara in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere teams of four began to fan out across the country, aiming to reach around 1.5m houses by tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kailahun, the eastern region hardest-hit by the outbreak, health worker Vandy Cawray prepared to be cut off for three days as he headed to remote villages he believes may not yet have received any education on the outbreak. Villagers in the northern district of Mayera vanished when education workers arrived to greet them on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows we still have work to do,&quot; Cawray said grimly. He shrugged off safety worries amid news of the team killed by residents in Womey, a Guinean village deep in the dense tropical forests that also spill into neighbouring Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better Future Foundation, BFF, has lauded efforts by the United States to address the current Ebola crisis in Liberia and other countries in West Africa, but underscores the urgent need for the establishment of a regional Center for Disease Control in the Mano River Union basin by US President Barack Obama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BFF pointed out that the center, if established, would serve as a regional hub for effective coordination and control of not only the deadly Ebola Virus Disease, which is ravaging Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone but also serve as a long term mechanism to promptly respond to other Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID), now and in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in Monrovia, BFF added that the hub which would be a referral medical think-tank would also be used in enhancing the knowledge and skills of local hospitals, health centers and biomedical engineers in the MRU countries. At the same time, BFF has expressed grave fear and disdain relative to the establishment of several Ebola Quarantine Centers in Monrovia, Liberia's Capital, by the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foundation said while it strongly supports sincere efforts by the Liberian Government and partners to establish Ebola Treatment Units in the country, it would be more prudent for such treatment units to be set up and operated outside densely populated or residential communities in Monrovia with little or no effective waste management and disposal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this is not done, BFF furthered: &quot;We are afraid that the entire population of Monrovia would be at risk&quot; of the Ebola Virus Disease which is also spread from human-to-human through body contacts and fluids of infected persons. &quot;Construction and operation of Ebola Treatment Units outside the Liberian Capital would go a long way in making a Monrovia ' Ebola Free,'&quot; the BFF statement, signed by its President Augustine S. Arkoi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foundation, at the same time, reiterated the need for the Liberian Government to adopt Smart Fight in the war against the Ebola Virus Disease by establishing a clear roadmap including putting into place the necessary safety measures leading to reopening of learning institutions in the country. BFF criticized the indefinite closure of schools nationwide under the pretext of the fight against Ebola while nothing is being done by the Liberian government for the resumption of classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that such approach defeats the intents and purposes of the Liberian government's declared war against Ebola. The Foundation pointed out that the current approach by the Government in the war against the spread of the Ebola Virus Disease without a well-defined containment plan, coupled with the abrupt imposition of a State of Emergency and a Curfew must be revisited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to BFF, the halting of learning opportunities for students throughout the country is counterproductive, stressing that: &quot;It remains a cardinal factor in subjecting the country to more brain-drain.&quot; BFF, an NGO established in 2003, is dedicated to promoting educational development; socioeconomic, international cultural understanding and cooperation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1047 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The covetous nature of oil, particularly for impoverished nations and peoples needing a magic wand to transformation, makes it subject of hot discussion under all circumstances. So even while the country is struggling to pull itself out of raging Ebola conquest, its oil and gas sector is not left out of the national discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of late, insinuations have been made in the public space with the effect of questioning what supposed to be the normal modus operandi of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), specifically its competitive international bidding process for four oil blocks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL is not taking the insinuations lying down. In a release, it further assures the Liberian public not only that the bidding process is being made utterly transparent, but also that all is being done to ensure the proceeds therefrom are responsibly and equitably dispensed for nothing else but the public good. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been concerns recently that the National Oil Company was using the fog of the Ebola epidemic to secretly dispose of four oil blocks. This concern was particularly articulated by the transparency watchdog group, Global Witness, which in its recent report warned against the ongoing bidding process of the blocks during these emergency times in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst other things, Global Witness said if the concessions are to benefit the Liberian in both short and long term, the preliminary model Production Sharing Contract and bidding documents need to be altered and safeguards should be included to improve transparency during the bid round, disclose company ownership, ensure information is publicly available during the companies' operations and strengthen human rights protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But NOCAL in a statement said there is no need for alarm because it is already on course with those concerns. Welcoming Global Witness comments on the current bid round, NOCAL said the solicitation of feedback on the Production Sharing Contract from many stakeholders is a standard practice for a bid round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hence, the Global Witness comments are being carefully considered by the Government, along with all other stakeholder feedback,&quot; the Company said, expressing delight that Global Witness praised many aspects of the bid round and it is essential that the Liberian media and the public be aware of these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to NOCAL, the current bid round is being conducted in a carefully planned, diligent and professional way to the highest international standards. The Company said the process has got the participation of one of the world's top international consulting firms, EY (formerly known as Ernst and Young), which will receive, open and assess the bids and are providing independent oversight to the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This guarantees legitimacy and transparency,&quot; NOCAL said, indicating further that the planning phase also included detailed advice from external experts in geologic data, petroleum geology, commercial transactions, fiscal modeling; petroleum law and economics; as well as advice on legal issues and good governance of natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planning, NOCAL said, also included significant legal and governance support from independent advisors with considerable industry experience, and extensive discussions with key development partners, including the US Economic Capacity Governance Initiative and IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fiscal terms were developed with the assistance of external advisors and approved by the Hydrocarbon Technical Committee to ensure Liberia gets the best deal possible,&quot; said the Liberian Oil Sector Managing company. &quot;Together, these provisions meet standards that match and even outdo quality bid rounds anywhere in the world, demonstrating the Government's commitment to transparency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL indicated that the bid round was conceived to ensure that vacated acreage not lie 'fallow' when it could be explored to advance the development of Liberia's oil sector, as the blocks being offered for investment are old acreage and do not fall under the 2012 moratorium on acreage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid round was planned and executed with appropriate time and care, and conception and planning pre-dated the Ebola crisis. However, Ebola has now made the success of the bid round even more important. The long-term future of Liberia cannot be forgotten while dealing with a short-term crisis. The revenue generated will help plug the serious economic damage wrought by the scourge of Ebola in the short term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long term, the careful design and the terms of the contracts will ensure economic benefits to Liberia, says NOCAL, adding that &quot;Above all, there is no chance that the ability of the Government to negotiate effectively on behalf of the country has been reduced because of the crisis.&quot; NOCAL insists that it has had constant positive feedback from the industry about how well organized this round is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 'Local Content Participation' provision designed in the investment round will also help create Liberian jobs and lead to meaningful Liberian participation in the upstream and downstream petroleum business,&quot; the Company stated further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a world first, bids from groups that include either a significant West African/ECOWAS upstream petroleum company that has committed to partner with a Liberian company, or a direct partnership with a Liberian company for a total of a 5% interest in the PSC by the Liberian company, will have their bids evaluated with a 20% uplift in their signature bonus proposal. This will encourage local partnerships and local content.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the company, this is in addition to the NOCAL participation of 10% and Citizen Participation of 5% for a total Liberian participation of 20%. The Company said it is also in addition to the other financial benefits, such as royalty, tax, and production sharing, which are all spelled out in the model Production Sharing Contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL assures Liberians and other interest groups that it will continue to work with all stakeholders to make this process successful in the country. &quot;As always, the aim is to develop our oil sector for the benefit of Liberia and the Liberian people,&quot; it stated and added: &quot;This bid round has the potential to generate major long-term benefits for Liberia, the benefits we will need more than ever when we emerge from our time of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) will dedicate the observance of its 50th Anniversary on September 30, 2014 to the national fight against the virulent Ebola virus disease that has claimed close to 1,500 lives across the country. The day will be exclusively observed as an all-media anti-Ebola awareness day through out the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadcast media houses will dedicate the entire day to airing the media's own role in the national fight, with members of the Press Union of Liberia going into selected communities to themselves deliver messages of hope and treatment to the people. Community and rural radio stations will relay other bigger stations to ensure that broadcast from a selected community will be simultaneously aired across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This time it will not be the government giving the media information to give to the people,&quot; PUL President K. Abdullai Kamara said. &quot;Media practitioners will themselves be going into the community to deliver the messages, and this will give the people confidence that there is hope in the fight against Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Union said while the media has been playing a significant role in creating public awareness that has led to change in attitude among the population, meeting and engaging communities face-to-face with prevention and safety information will be a plus to the national response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the release, the PUL Golden Jubilee observance will also consider strengthening policy advice to the government, continued awareness by the media and physical impact on affected communities, while paying homage to all Liberians who have fallen to the virus. The journalist union is calling on media houses to commit the day to making individual and collective contributions to the fight against the dangerous epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the PUL has announced with sadness the death of Journalist Yaya Kromah. Family members told the Union Thursday afternoon that he died at the Ebola Treatment Center at the J.F.K. Hospital in Monrovia. He is the first Liberian journalist to fall prey to the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May his passing inspire in all journalists and members of the Press Union of Liberia the courage to step up awareness and education about Ebola across Liberia,&quot; PUL President Abdullai Kamara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The PUL is very deeply saddened by the news,&quot; Secretary General D. Kaihenneh Sengbeh added on social media. &quot;This shows that Ebola has no boundary and all Liberians must collaborate to fight the invisible enemy that is tearing the country apart. Our deepest sympathy to the rest of the family and May his soul and all those departed rest in perfect peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1154 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government's own statistics on Ebola fatalities supplied international institutions not only depicts a continued gloom and doom of the state of affairs in the country regarding the fight against the deadly virus but also helps to further animate public nervousness and despair. And there are expectations that experts will in the next few days trumpet a more ominous projection about the battle in favor of the pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These kinds of gloomy prospects accentuated by medical experts and public officials, like it would be in any warlike situation, however the scientific justification, demoralizes the fighting force and hurries many to premature surrender even before the enemy strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has deciphered the self-defeating implications of the continued release of paralyzing statistics and projections. Thus yesterday, she took to the national rostrum to soothe nerves and galvanize the citizenry into action. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Mid June, Ebola fatalities in Monrovia have been exponentially increased by the day. It has never been stable or nosedived; courtesy of those Liberians who have their fingers and eyes on victims of the disease. Particularly from July 19 to date, the infection and death rates have jumped high, with reports that Liberia records 400 deaths successively for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though some pundits diametrically disagreed, citing possible indistinguishableness of actual Ebola fatalities from other common sicknesses that were taking their toll in Liberia before the current pestilence, the official version is the most acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper pages and social media links show dead bodies littering the streets and communities and with tales of more sick people, nearly all classified as Ebola victims. And by this account, Liberians and those helping to fight the deadly virus have settled down on the premise that the fight is being lost and Liberia's faces colossal casualties if not possible extermination from Planet Earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the coming of huge international support in material and human resources, there are still dire projections--some saying the already frightening rate of casualties is yet to reach the peak it got to reach before receding to all the interventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's really scary and it seems President Sirleaf does not want Liberians perish to heartbreak and fear principally from those gloomy news coming out and wants to cheer up the people a bit and put them in a fighting spirit. &quot;I believe in that spirit of resilience. I believe in the Liberian people. I believe that we are stronger than the greatest threat with which we are currently faced,&quot; President Sirleaf asserted in a nationwide broadcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued: &quot;And I believe we will prevail. The war did not defeat us, a completely destroyed economy - the greatest collapse since World War II - did not defeat us. Ebola will not defeat us - never. We have faced great tragedies before. These have tested us and shown our true character. I call on you to stand up again. We are fighting back and we will win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian head of state knows the soft spot of her people; things they really long for to return to sooner than later. So she said: &quot;We need to get our schools reopened. We need to re-establish normal healthcare. We need to get our food belt planting so we don't miss a whole season; indeed we need to be producing more so that we grow out of poverty. We need airlines to return so people can come and leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to find ways of caring for the orphans who so tragically now exist in greater numbers. And we need to press the play button since everything is on pause at the moment. We need to get back to the work of building roads, power plants, and attracting more investment to create jobs. We need to get on with the business to stimulate and strengthen the growing private sector, with emphasis on promoting Liberian entrepreneurship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get back to normality, President Sirleaf said there is only one choice for Liberians: &quot;To pull out of this, we must fight back. Our cherished legacy of resilience - of making it when no one gives us a chance - can never be defeated. In the heat of our civil and political crisis, people wrote Liberia off. We were seen as a pariah. We went through some of the darkest hours that some people, any nation can endure. But with our fighting spirit, we survived. We more than survived. We thrived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She averred that as the deadly disease is tackled her government will spare no effort. &quot;We will do everything that can be done. We will seek every solution that can be sought. No effort will be spared in defeating our common enemy so that we can return to the business of building our country - building a future for our children and our children's children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President lauded countless Liberians who have been working night and day to try to fight this disease, including &quot;the nurses and doctors who could have fled, but have made the brave decision to stay and treat the sick; our sons who are doing the physically and emotionally draining work of collecting bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our nation, our people, is forever grateful to all of you and we expect to announce early next week that this gratitude goes beyond words,&quot; he said, and added: &quot;To our security forces who provide the protection as others serve - to the AFL who will return to the barracks at the end of the month, and will work with the US military in engineering work; and the LNP and BIN who will continue to carry on with the responsibility to protect, we say thank you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf also commended regional institutions and others who have come from aboard to help Liberia. &quot;Our brothers and sisters from around the world who have come here to help, who have exhibited the highest level of service to humanity, indeed some of whom have died doing so. They deserve our collective thanks from the bottom of our hearts,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader assured citizens that in the midst of the prevailing difficult number of fatalities, there is hope because, according to her, a total of 300 plus patients have recovered free from the virus and gone home. &quot;Yes, there is hope,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;hope that it is within our individual and collective abilities to protect ourselves while caring for those we love.&quot; She said further Liberians can prevent more deaths by caring for those who are sick properly, as well as preventing ourselves from contracting the disease and infecting the people who loved and cared about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want you, the Liberian people, to know that your Government will to do all that is within our power to ensure that the scenario in the projections do not come to pass,&quot; she further asserted. &quot;It is in recognition of the scale of this disease that we have enlisted the help of our bilateral and multilateral partners. We will continue to take clear actions and introduce the measures required to break the transmission chain and reverse the spread of the virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The language is familiar. &quot;A potential threat of a human catastrophe unparalleled in modern times.&quot; More than 2,500 have died, and the same number are dying. Incidence of the disease is said to be doubling, even trebling, in some parts of Africa by the month. Hundreds of thousands now face death. Barack Obama declares a menace &quot;spiralling out of control, getting worse . . . with profound economic, political and security implications for all of us&quot;. The window of opportunity to contain the outbreak is apparently closing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is now six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in modern history. The director general of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan, calls the outbreak &quot;the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen&quot;. The UN remarks that we could &quot;stop the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in six to nine months, but only if a massive global response is implemented&quot;. As it is, the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them. According to Chan, &quot;there is not one single bed available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The language of crisis is banal. Threat, disaster and catastrophe lie flat on the page. The nouns may be awesome, but are let down by qualifiers: &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may face&quot;, &quot;potential&quot;. We see lines of Africans waiting helplessly to die, but we have seen many over the years. The suspicion is always of hyperbole, what Americans call agency log-rolling. When Obama speaks of Ebola having &quot;profound security implications&quot; I eyed my nearest defence lobbyist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The true measure of how seriously the world takes a &quot;crisis&quot; is not the description but the response. This Ebola outbreak began last December. America is now slowly coming forward, with 17 treatment centres, and &quot;training 500 medical staff&quot;. Cuba is sending 165 helpers. China is sending 60. Britain is &quot;planning a clinic&quot;. Nurses are flying to help, former patients giving blood and volunteers queuing in Oxford for vaccine trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lumbering dinosaur of the drugs industry has at least been galvanised into life. GlaxoSmithKline is producing 10,000 doses of vaccine in case tests show it can work. True, as with the experimental cure ZMapp, the vaccines will go to medical workers. But the regulators have found they can process the paperwork &quot;in just four working days&quot;, when it takes months, even years, to process other life-saving drugs. We might ask: why the difference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This belated activity hardly measures up to the words quoted in my first paragraph. Ebola was first isolated in 1976. Central Africa has experienced increasing outbreaks since the mid-1990s. Yet this spring there were still no drugs available and no sign of the millions of dollars required in associated aid. The best Washington's federal drug administration could do, under the cosh of the pharmaceutical firms, was warn Africans against fake medicines. Pushing untested &quot;experimental&quot; ones was unethical, it said. Drug companies had enough trouble before when accused of testing drugs on developing countries. Whatever the crisis, there must be no bad karma for big pharma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast this hesitant humanitarian intervention with the hysteria driving the next military intervention in Iraq. This needed no talk of catastrophe, no drums from the media. Events in Syria and Iraq were monstrous, inhuman, cruel and - as we British say - unacceptable. So a &quot;threat to national security&quot; is declared and, bang, in go the air strikes. Anyone who protests is a wimp. America is putting 1,600 troops back on Iraqi soil &quot;as advisers&quot;. Iraq is said to be flooded with special forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every military pundit now warns against doing in Iraq precisely what Islamic State (Isis) wants, which is offer it a powerful Christian enemy to rally jihadists to its flag. General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in Washington, is deaf to such warnings. He says he will be deploying ground troops in rescue missions and even &quot;attacks against specific Isil targets&quot;. The Pentagon was planning to widen &quot;the types of targets it hits from the air, focusing on Islamic State leaders&quot;. That was, said Dempsey, a &quot;first step&quot;. And the step after that? The idea of military escalation seems to electrify democratic politicians. David Cameron dives to his bunker. Tabloids scream for revenge. Everyone congas to the deadly dance of mission creep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must be ever more likely that a fundamentalist enclave in western Iraq will survive for a while. As with the Taliban's rule in Kabul, we helped create it and will have to live with it. After the most appalling slaughter, much of it at our hands, we find another part of the world resolutely refusing to behave as we ordered. We bomb and kill, and it is as bad as it was before, probably worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, the most encouraging news this week was that al-Qaida in Syria had pleaded with Isis not to kill aid workers, since they were trying to save Muslim lives. This was some antidote to one of the gloomiest talks I have heard recently, by Yves Daccord, director general of the international Red Cross. Never, he said, had humanitarian relief work been so compromised as now through being seen as a proxy for one side or another in a civil conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frequently, as in Syria, the Red Cross was seen as on the side of the ruling regime; elsewhere it was seen as on the side of rebels. Everywhere its image was tarnished by association with foreign, especially western, military intervention. The humanitarian ethic of the Red Cross and the early UN had become corrupted by militarism. Local commanders, said Daccord, demand that the UN and its local agents, &quot;prove to me that you are really independent and impartial, that your service is relevant&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relating the relief of suffering to &quot;national security&quot; - as Obama does, even in the case of Ebola - is madness. A casualty of the &quot;anti-terror&quot; wars of the past 15 years has been the confusion of humanitarian with politico/military intervention. It not only undermines the ideological purity of aid but also endangers aid workers. The impartiality of the founders of the Red Cross and the UN has been swamped in the rush to war. Humanity loses out to killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have dithered for six months over Ebola in Africa, yet in Iraq chase once more that will-o'-the wisp of political machismo: the perfect bomb strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister of Guinea said that seven bodies had been found after a team of health workers went missing during a push to raise awareness of the outbreak of Ebola which started in the country nine months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the team were set upon by angry residents in the remote village of Womey, where many remain in denial about the disease, or suspicious of foreign health workers. Several failed to return following the visit on Tuesday. Officials earlier said some - including three journalists and the director and two senior doctors of the main local hospital - were being held captive. Atempts to reach them stalled when angry residents destroyed bridges leading to the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting started off well; the traditional chiefs welcomed the delegation with 10 kola nuts as a traditional greeting,&quot; said a resident who was present at the meeting and gave only his first name, Yves. &quot;It was afterwards that some youths came out and started stoning them. They dragged some of them away, and damaged their vehicles.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an announcement made on state television late last night, Mohamed Said Fofana said authorities had located the bodies a day after the group was abducted. Among the dead were three Guinean radio journalists who had been covering the education efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government spokesman, Damantang Albert Camara, told Reuters: &quot;The bodies were found in the village latrine. Three of them had their throats slit.&quot; Some others from the delegation are still believed to be missing. The Ebola outbreak across five west African countries has grown into the world's biggest ever epidemic, with more than 700 cases - out of 5,300 overall - emerging in the past week alone, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO said there was a desperate shortage of health workers and supplies in an epidemic likely to last many more months. Health workers across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where most of the cases are, have been attacked by citizens in a region experiencing the deadly virus for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district of Nzerekore, where the team disappeared, exploded in clashes after health workers tried to spray the local market last month. About 50 people were arrested and two dozen police officers who were sent to quell the riots were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, almost 30,000 volunteers will go house-to-house to raise awareness of the disease during a three-day &quot;lockdown&quot;, when residents have been asked to remain at home. Thousands of soldiers are to enforce the curfew, due to start at midnight last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sluggish international response to the crisis has picked up in recent days. The US will send 3,000 troops to Liberia to help provide desperately-needed boots on the ground in the country hardest hit by the outbreak. France's president, Francois Hollande, said the former colonial power would set up a military hospital to help tackle the disease in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN security council last night called the Ebola outbreak &quot;a threat to international peace and security&quot; and urged the world to provide health experts, field hospitals and medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resolution adopted unanimously by the UN's most powerful body at an emergency meeting with an unprecedented 130 countries as co-sponsors reflected rising global concern at the outbreak. It marked only the second time the security council has addressed a public health emergency, the first being the HIV/Aids pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN health chief, Dr Margaret Chan, said the &quot;deadly and dreaded Ebola virus got ahead of us&quot; and it was time to catch up. &quot;This is likely the greatest peacetime challenge that the United Nations and its agencies have ever faced,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said the number of Ebola cases was doubling every three weeks and he called for a 20-fold increase in aid totaling almost $1bn to tackle the crisis over the next six months. Ban said the largest outbreak of Ebola in history &quot;demands the attention of the world&quot; and &quot;unprecedented&quot; action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN is leading the global response to contain and eradicate Ebola and Ban announced that he was establishing a UN emergency mission to tackle the challenge. He also thanked Barack Obama for sending 3,000 troops to provide expertise in logistics, training and engineering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will also discuss strategies for ensuring that the global response works to strengthen national and county-level institutions by building local capacity (public and private, including for community-based care for Ebola and other diseases).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Mile Health, also known in Liberia as Tiyatien Health, is delivering comprehensive community-based healthcare and health systems strengthening in remote regions in Liberia, particularly in Grand Gedeh County.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A World Health Organization (WHO) consultant on Ebola Case Management in Liberia says survivors of the deadly Ebola virus are more secured than people who are yet to contract the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Atai Omoruto said family and community members should not be afraid of people who survived the virus because they are the safest ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please accept them; these people don't have the virus any more. We've cured them of the virus and they cannot infect anybody... So, please accept them like you would accept anybody else... &quot; Dr. Omoruto said in an interview with a team of LMC/IREX reporters recently at the John F. Kennedy Ebola Treatment Unit in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruto heads a team of doctors from Uganda who are currently assigned at the JFK-ETU. The Ugandan team is expected to be reassigned to the 150 beds Island Clinic Ebola Treatment Unit on Bushrod Island upon completion of that facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said survivals of Ebola have gotten special antibiotic in their immune systems and can no longer be affected by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruto told families and community members to stop discriminating against Ebola survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the WHO Ebola Case Management Consultant warned survivors to abstain from sex for at least three to six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruto said the Ebola virus usually survives in the semen for about three months following treatment and it was therefore advisable for one to abstain from sex or use condoms when engaging in sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the survivals to follow the advice in order to avoid transmitting the virus to their loved ones during these three to six months healing periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola survivals have complained of serious discrimination from family and community members across Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Ebola Holding Center at the Tubmanburg Government Hospital in Bomi County has discharged its first two Ebola survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bomi County Health Officer Dr. Gborbee Logan said the 12 beds holding center was established by the Bomi County Health Team to temporarily keep people suspected of Ebola in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to journalists Wednesday in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, Dr. Logan said the first two female survivals were previously tested positive of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Logan stated that most of the patients at the center reported themselves to the center early for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said although the virus does not have treatment, but early reporting to treatment centers is important in helping patients recover from the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is hope; all we need is that you need to come early. Once you start to get fever and headache that is the time to come... Don't wait until you start bleeding, because when bleeding situation comes, it is late... &quot; Dr. Logan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the two discharged patients are expected to be reunited with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those who survived the Ebola, Bendu Kamara said she contracted the virus from her brother-in-law who was ill and later died. Kamara said her husband later died along with their son. She promised to serve as ambassador to create awareness about the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Movement for Labor Rights and Justice (MOLAJ) through support from its international partners has embarked on the teaching of detergent usage in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union says charity groups and Liberians providing anti Ebola items to citizens should educate those receiving the items about the usage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOLAJ observed that due to the failure of donor groups to educate the people on the usage of donated detergent, the recipients are infecting themselves due to lack of knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the union in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare concluded a week long workshop for workers at various places under the umbrella of MOLAJ on the use of anti Ebola materials or detergents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOLAJ Project Advisor, David D. Sackoh said with the rapid spread of the Ebola virus in the sub-region, United Steel Workers Union (USWU), a strong partner of MOLAJ based in Canada and United States of America, provided an initial fund of $10,000 Canadian money to buttress the efforts of the union to protect its workers in the fight against the disease across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sackoh explained that Firestone Agriculture Workers Union of Liberia (FWUL), United Workers Union of Liberia Local #4 - ArcelorMittal, Liberia Labor Congress, (LLC), General Agriculture and Allied Workers Union of Liberia in the country launched an Ebola awareness campaign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first planeload of hospital equipment airlifted by the United States government in the battle against deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa will arrive in Liberia on Friday, a senior administration official disclosed Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters news agency reported that the United States hopes its expanded effort to contain the spread of the virus will help rally other countries in ramping up the global response to the epidemic, U.S. aid official Nancy Lindborg told a U.S. House of Representatives committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Reuters, the plane is the first of 13 air shipments headed for Monrovia, carrying equipment for a 25-bed hospital to be built in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facility will be staffed by 65 Americans who will treat healthcare workers infected while fighting the worst outbreak of the virus on record, according to Lindborg. The epidemic has killed nearly 2,500 people, about half of those infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army Major General Darryl Williams, who is leading the military operation, arrived in Liberia on Tuesday to sketch out plans for the effort announced by President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration on Tuesday outlined a dramatic expansion of the American response to Ebola. The United States will send 3,000 military engineers, medical personnel and other troops to West Africa, particularly the affected Ebola nations. They will build 17 treatment centers with 100 beds each and train thousands of healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hope, and the goal, is that, inspired by the response of the U.S. ... there will be a ramped-up response from a large number of international actors,&quot; Lindborg, assistant administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is expected to announce its own plans for tackling the epidemic soon, and the need for global action will be discussed at a United Nations meeting on Thursday, Lindborg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has held discussions with other countries about their Ebola response as part of his recent meetings with international leaders in Paris, she said. The African Union and the European Union are also mobilizing resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There hasn't been a requirement for (a) large-scale global capacity to address Ebola,&quot; Lindborg said. &quot;This will be a sea change in how the global community understands the response to Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus struck in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea before spreading to Nigeria and Senegal. Some fear mounting health and economic consequences if the disease reaches the Ivory Coast, which exports 40 percent of the world's cocoa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. mission will include a tent city and a facility to train 500 health workers a week in the rigorous clinical procedures necessary to prevent the disease from spreading at medical sites, Lindborg said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">574 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's acting Minister of Finance and Development Planning has underscored government's ardent commitment to making Liberia Ebola free as the World Bank boosts the country's effort when it approved a $52 million grant for Liberia to eradicate the deadly virus, Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's Ambassador to the United States Jeremiah Sulunteh signed on behalf of the government in Washington, D.C. while the Bank's Vice President Mahktar Diop signed for the Bank. Two of the worst affected countries, Guinea and Sierra Leone were represented at the signing ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Amara Konneh who witnessed the ceremony live via video conference from the World Bank office in Congo Town, Monrovia, was elated as he thanked the World Bank for breathing fresh life in government's unwavering commitment to fight the deadly virus which has claimed hundreds of lives in the country since the outbreak last March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disclosing that Liberia needs about $200 million to eradicate the virus, Minister Konneh said the new World Bank grant money would be used in three categories including support to the health system by improving various health facilities across the country, investing in the health workers who are risking their lives on a daily basis and providing food and basic services to various quarantined centers around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh lamented that the Ebola epidemic has seriously affected the economic sector, particularly the mining and agriculture sectors. &quot;For Liberia this epidemic is creating a lots of set-backs for our development agenda, our economy will decline by 3.5 percent this fiscal year which will affect job creation and the livelihood of our citizens,&quot; hinted Minister Konneh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Sulunteh expressed gratitude to the World Bank Group for the timely help and assured the Bank that the grant will significantly change the result of the battle against the deadly Ebola disease in Liberia. &quot;The situation in Liberia is more than a civil war, because in a civil war one can call for ceasefire and talk to various parties involved, but with Ebola there is no ceasefire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank Group's (WBG) Board of Executive Directors approved a US$105 million grant to finance Ebola-containment efforts underway in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, help families and communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis, and rebuild and strengthen essential public health systems in the three worst-affected countries to guard against future disease outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new grant is part of the US$200 million Ebola emergency mobilization first announced by the WBG in early August. The WBG said its new Ebola Emergency Response project mobilized US$52 million for Liberia, the country with the highest number of Ebola infections, US$28 million for Sierra Leone, and US$25 million for Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allocations were calculated according to the World Health Organization's Roadmap and assessments of the relative severity of the epidemic in each country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WBG said it would almost certainly mobilize more financing for the countries since &quot;the immediate response is still significantly under-resourced for the purposes of curbing the outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 40% of the new grant, which is financed by the WB's IDA Crisis Response Window that normally helps poor countries recover from severe natural disasters or economic crises, could also be used for retroactive financing of eligible Ebola containment efforts in the three worst-affected countries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Managing Editor of The News Newspaper Joseph G. Bartuah has reminded Liberians and other folks on social media not to forget about the original silent killer, HIV/AIDS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in view of this grim reality, a consortium of public health practitioners and some healthcare workers are exerting efforts to ensure that issues of HIV/AIDS get to the federal level of the United States Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said public health practitioners in the United States want September 9th to be declared as National African Immigrant AIDS and Hepatitis Awareness Day in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To kick off this proactive mainstreaming advocacy, the Massachusetts Multicultural AIDS Coalition (MAC) and the African for Improved Access (AFIA), in concert with other like-minded organizations, held an elaborate program at their 31 Heath Street headquarters on September 16, 2014 in Roxbury, Mass. Boston City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartuah recalled in the past six months, the deadly Ebola Virus Disease has been making global headlines because it is literally raging hell within the Mano River basin of West Africa, which includes Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he observed that prior to the Ebola outbreak, HIV/AIDS had been one of the silent killers, not only in Africa, but also among African immigrants in the United States and other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President John Dramani Mahama has frowned on countries isolating Ebola affected countries. He said such decision is not the best way to jointly fight the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Ghanaian President said isolating countries will further compound the precarious situation especially trade and commerce thereby seriously affecting the economies of these countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama, who is also current chairman of the sub-regional organization ECOWAS, made the statement when he addressed a joint press conference during a one-day solidarity visit to Liberia on Monday, September 15, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian leader informed the media gathering that there have been lots of international commitments to fight the disease but said turning these commitments into actuality was too slow and encouraged donor countries to fast track their commitment since it's intended to save lives in an emergency situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama said he was in Liberia to join the advocacy for more international concerted efforts in eradicating the virus out of the sub-region. He praised the courage and determination of the Liberian Government and its people in defeating the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chairman of ECOWAS, the Ghanaian leader said he has begun consultations with world and continental bodies as well as airlines that have stopped flying to Liberia and other affected countries to begin plans to re-engage the Liberian authorities in overturning their isolation as the affected countries have now put into place World Health Organization (WHO) recommended measures in order to stop the spread of the virus to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affected countries, including Liberia, have put into place a vigorous health checks including temperature reading at all ports of entry/exit as recommended by WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a demonstration of how Ghana is prepared to help affected countries, President Mahama disclosed that he has held discussions with the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to allow his country's capital, Accra, to serve as a transit center for international flights bringing in logistics, medicine and relief items for the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf described Ghana as a sisterly country that has always been by Liberia during good and bad times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Liberian Government and people, she expressed appreciation for the role being played by Ghana and President Mahama, in his capacity as chairman of ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf hoped Liberians will continue to work together for the total eradication of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL) says it welcomes the recent comments provided by Global Witness on the current bid round. The company said solicitation of feedback on the Production Sharing Contract from many stakeholders is a standard practice for a bid round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, NOCAL indicated that the Global Witness comments are being carefully considered by the Government, along with all other stakeholder feedback.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a release, the oil company explained that this bid round is being conducted in a carefully planned, diligent and professional way to the highest international standards. It has participation of one of the world's top international consulting firms, EY (formerly known as Ernst and Young). NOCAL said EY will receive, open and assess the bids and are providing independent oversight to the process. This process, according to the company, guarantees legitimacy and transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company disclosed that the planning phase also included detailed advice from external experts on geologic data, petroleum geology, commercial transactions, fiscal modeling; petroleum law and economics; as well as advice on legal issues and good governance of natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The planning also included significant legal and governance support from independent advisors with considerable industry experience, and extensive discussions with key development partners, including the US Economic Capacity Governance Initiative and IMF. The fiscal terms were developed with assistance of external advisors and approved by Hydrocarbon Technical Committee to ensure Liberia gets the best deal possible,&quot; Nocal stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL claimed that these provisions meet standards that match and even outdo quality bid rounds anywhere in the world, demonstrating the Government's commitment to transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the bid round was conceived to ensure that vacated acreage not lie 'fallow' when it could be explored to advance the development of Liberia's oil sector. The blocks being offered for investment are old acreage and do not fall under the 2012 moratorium on acreage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL: &quot;The bid round was planned and executed with appropriate time and care, and conception and planning pre-dated the Ebola crisis. However, Ebola has now made the success of the bid round even more important. The long-term future of Liberia cannot be forgotten while dealing with a short-term crisis. The revenue generated will help plug the serious economic damage wrought by the scourge of Ebola in the short term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long term, the company added that the careful design and terms of the contracts will ensure economic benefits to Liberia, noting that &quot;there is no chance that the ability of the Government to negotiate effectively on behalf of the country has been reduced because of the crisis. NOCAL has had constant positive feedback from the industry about how well organized this round is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expounding further it said 'Local Content Participation' provision designed into the investment round will also help create Liberian jobs and lead to meaningful Liberian participation in the upstream and downstream petroleum business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL: &quot; In a world first, bids from groups that include either a significant West African/ECOWAS upstream petroleum company that has committed to partner with a Liberian company, or a direct partnership with a Liberian company for a total of a 5% interest in the PSC by the Liberian company, will have their bids evaluated with a 20% uplift in their signature bonus proposal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Representative of the United Nations International Children Education Fund (UNICEF), Dr. Fazlul Haque, has disclosed that the closure of schools throughout the country due to Ebola outbreak has affected about 16 percent of school-going children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Haque said he wants psychosocial support for children and family members affected as a result of the closure of schools as well as for those of them who are made orphans and are being quarantined due to the death of their parents from the Ebola virus. According to the UNICEF Deputy Boss, &quot;15% of children recorded have their parents died of confirmed cases, leaving their children vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further noted, &quot;These children are now in an extremely vulnerable position and are unable to access the usual community supports due to stigma and fear of people catching the disease&quot;. He made the statement at a UNICEF sponsored a five-day training of trainers (TOT) workshop in Monrovia on Monday September 15. The workshop brought together over 25 health workers and clinicians from the 15 counties and was facilitated by international partners of the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haque stressed the need for more health centers and Ebola Treatment Units to be constructed due to the mounting Ebola case load that is clearly evident, stressing, &quot;There is at the moment a pressing need to scale up our work providing more Ebola treatment facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Haque promised the Liberian Government UNICEF's support through training and events that will provide social workers and mental health clinicians the relevant skills and ability to roll out the needed for psychosocial services to meet the needs of communities that are affected by the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, there are currently over 2,500 suspected, probable and confirmed cases of Ebola, with 1,349 deaths, the highest in the sub region, while 75% of all confirmed cases are women and mothers who are primary caregivers. For her part, Deputy Health Minister, Vivian Cherue thanked UNICEF for the gesture and encouraged the participants to take the training seriously so as to help provide knowledge to others who they are to train after gaining basic knowledge for five days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1781 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fellow Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since March, we have faced a terrible tragedy in our country. Along with our sister Republics of Guinea and Sierra Leone, we continue to battle an unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola virus disease. The virus was first noticed in December 2013 in a small village in Guinea. It was not confirmed as Ebola for three and a half months as no one - not even the world's experts - knew that this was Ebola. By the time it was confirmed the virus had already spread and was in Sierra Leone and on its way to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We now know that Ebola can only be transmitted from person to person. So all that is needed is to stop person-to-person transmission: put the person in isolation, and ensure that the people caring for them are wearing protective equipment. If that had happened last December, there would have been not a single further case. The difficulty, of course, is that did not happen. Ebola is rare and it was very easy to confuse it with other diseases we have in this region, such as cholera or Lassa fever. Our cultural and our family practices did not help when we finally woke up to the disease so we have to keep telling each other about what to do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a patient is sick with Ebola, it is crucial that they are isolated from others and given appropriate care. But we know that for families to see their loved ones being taken where they are not able to follow and be with them is strange and frightening. We also know that to have a case of Ebola in a family can lead to stigma and shame. And so some families hid their sick relatives. They did not take them to the health facility. They did not look for vital medical assistance. They continued to care for their relatives at home, in secret. By doing this, the virus continued to spread -through Lofa, the country's bread basket, to Nimba, to Monrovia where we face the largest urban outbreak of one of the deadliest of diseases known to man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease has now spread to 10 counties, with Lofa and Montserrado the hardest hit. It has not spared anyone - we have lost mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. In some instances, it has taken multiple members of families. To date, the number of those affected by the disease has been disheartening: There have been a total of 2535 cumulative cases which includes confirmed, probable and suspected cases. Of these, a total of 1328 have died. A total of 172 cumulative health care workers have been affected and 82 have died. We are responding to over 100 children orphaned by the disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With limited resources and capacity, the government responded swiftly and decisively to the outbreak. We declared a health emergency and empowered the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to lead the response, working with WHO, MSF and other partners. In consultation with the National Legislature, we declared a State of Emergency. We quarantined and contained areas of the country, limited non-essential movements in parts of the country, instituted a curfew, suspended non-essential government work and closed schools. We acted within the scale of our capacity to contain the scale of an outbreak we could not imagine possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We worked in strategic partnership with governments and organizations that have specific expertise in controlling epidemics. We followed the roadmap introduced by the World Health Organization, which has now been incorporated into our national Ebola Response Strategy. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak an international public health emergency. In the next few days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will release projections about the trajectory of the outbreak based on current trends and data. We have to be realistic about the scope and size of the problem and accept the scientific projections. However, we are hopeful that we do not have to meet those projections. Those numbers reflect will the worst case scenarios, the result of what could happen if we do not take the actions that are required to break the transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the midst of these difficult numbers, there is hope - because a total of because a total of 300 plus patients have recovered free from the virus and gone home. Yes, there is hope - hope that it is within our individual and collective abilities to protect ourselves while caring for those we love. I know that we can prevent more deaths by caring for those who are sick properly, as well as preventing ourselves from contracting the disease and infecting the people we love and care about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want you, the Liberian people, to know that your Government will to do all that is within our power to ensure that the scenario in the projections do not come to pass. It is in recognition of the scale of this disease that we have enlisted the help of our bilateral and multilateral partners. We will continue to take clear actions and introduce the measures required to break the transmission chain and reverse the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And you, our citizens must do your part. Each one has to be responsible for all because the actions of one affect the health of all. We will continue to ask for international help, but until we take responsibility of this problem as individuals, as families, as neighborhoods, as communities, as districts, as counties and as a nation, this problem will not go away. Especially in this regard, the next few months will be crucial in this fight. On behalf of the Liberian people and in my own name, I want to thank President Obama and the American people for scaling up the American response. I have also spoken to several members of the US congress who are giving President Obama the support that he needs. We remain in touch with the leaders of other governments to take similar steps and join us in partnership to end this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we reach out to partners, we have stressed the need to restore basic and secondary health care, to respond to the many who are sick with typhoid, malaria and other diseases that need to be treated. We have pointed out the gains in reduction in HIV, AIDS, malaria and child mortality that need to be maintained and enhanced. But we have also stressed the need to strengthen our health care system in the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to thank the countless Liberians who have been working night and day to try to fight this disease: the nurses and doctors who could have fled, but have made the brave decision to stay and treat the sick; our sons who are doing the physically and emotionally draining work of collecting bodies. Our nation, our people, is forever grateful to all of you and we expect to announce early next week that this gratitude goes beyond words. Our security forces who provide the protection as others serve - to the AFL who will return to the barracks at the end of the month, and will work with the US military in engineering work; and the LNP and BIN who will continue to carry on with the responsibility to protect, we say thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would also like to thank our regional institutions and the many people who have come from aboard to help us. Our brothers and sisters from around the world who have come here to help, who have exhibited the highest level of service to humanity, indeed some of whom have died doing so. They deserve our collective thanks from the bottom of our hearts. But defeating Ebola is just the start. We also need to ensure that Ebola does not destroy our livelihood. As we attempt to protect lives, we must similarly protect livelihood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were just starting to work our way out of poverty at the time Ebola struck. The IMF had us on track to meet the target under our Agenda for Transformation; we were making good progress on building the critical infrastructure needed to alleviate the poverty of our people; we were poised to turn investment into operations so as to create the jobs we need; we had made significant progress to reform our education system and improve our health system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had grown up to 11 airlines flying into RIA weekly. The number of people flying in and out of the country was steadily rising. We were building roads, expanding access to electricity, reducing infant and maternal mortality. We have to return to those tasks. Even as we work to defeat this unseen enemy, we must do so with our eyes toward the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, our partners in financial institutions have not let us down - the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Commission, which supports our Ebola response will also be with us in our war to restore economic and social services. We need to get our schools reopened. We need to re-establish normal health care. We need to get our food belt planting so we don't miss a whole season; indeed we need to be producing more so that we grow out of poverty. We need airlines to return so people can come and leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to find ways of caring for the orphans who so tragically now exist in greater numbers. And we need to press the play button since everything is on pause at the moment. We need to get back to the work of building roads, power plants, and attracting more investment to create jobs. We need to get on with the business to stimulate and strengthen the growing private sector, with emphasis on promoting Liberian entrepreneurship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is only one choice for us. To pull out of this, we must fight back. Our cherished legacy of resilience - of making it when no one gives us a chance - can never be defeated. In the heat of our civil and political crisis, people wrote Liberia off. We were seen as a pariah. We went through some of the darkest hours that some people, any nation can endure. But with our fighting spirit, we survived. We more than survived. We thrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe in that spirit of resilience. I believe in the Liberian people. I believe that we are stronger than the greatest threat with which we are currently faced. And I believe we will prevail. The war did not defeat us, a completely destroyed economy - the greatest collapse since World War II - did not defeat us. Ebola will not defeat us - never. We have faced great tragedies before. These have tested us and shown our true character. I call on you to stand up again. We are fighting back and we will win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so my people, as we tackle this disease, I want you to know that your government will spare no effort. We will do everything that can be done. We will seek every solution that can be sought. No effort will be spared in defeating our common enemy so that we can return to the business of building our country - building a future for our children and our children's children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May God bless our great nation. May we stand together as I know we can. And may God continue to bless us. Now let us go and win this fight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive of the association, Cllr. J.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Said Lansanah furthered that it is time that Liberians and foreign residents to soberly reflect on the carnage caused by the deadly disease in the county, and coordinate their activities in the fight to contain the virus. He maintained that it is not only the matter of sophistication, but a simple hygienic procedure that needs to be practiced by every Liberian and foreign residents to contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Cllr. J Bima Lansanah has reiterated the need for the creation of additional divisions of the civil law court. He said the capacity of the current civil law court is limited to adjudicate and disposed of the numerous cases pending before the court for determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, the office of the Sergeant At Arms serves as chief law enforcement officer, protocol officer, and executive officer of the House of Representatives, functions which the deputy speaker said he would assume pending the return to the office of General Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a staff at the office of the Sergeant-At-Arm, on the basis of the anonymity, wonder why such a vital office like the office of the Sergeant at Arm should be closed because a staff member died of Ebola, when the Constitution provides that the Legislature should remain in session during a state of emergency requiring that the office to remain open for the smooth running of the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff member indicated that it was unacceptable and rather ridiculous that Deputy Speaker Barchue could choose to usurp the function of their office, saying that the best thing to do is to pass the order that any member of the office feeling feverish should remain home until treated to be healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the deputy speaker told a news conference Wednesday at his Capitol Building office that the Sergeant At-Arms and his team will stay home until the end of this September, stating that this measure is intended to safeguard the lawmakers and other Capitol Building staffers who come to work daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Speaker Barchue said the news of the demise of the late Deputy Sergeant At-Arms, Mr. James K. Morlu, was broken to members of the House of Representatives by his colleagues who did not get in physical contact with him that Mr. Morlu died of the Ebola at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru town, causing the House to send the rest of them home based upon the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Speaker Barchue told journalists that the House has earlier advise offices in the Capitol Building that that any member of their staff, including the office of Sergeant-At-Arms that is suspected of any of the symptoms of Ebola should promptly inform authorities of the House so as to take the much needed measures to save the person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Speaker who is the Representative for Grand Bassa County District #1 said at the end of this month, they will resume their duties. Rep. Barchue stated that the House has already made some provision of food items available for the family of the deceased and the families of the legislative staffers sent home on account of Ebola fear, saying that while health authorities will continue to monitor them for the required period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the absence of the Sergeant At-Arms and his team for their job site at the Capitol building has created a vacuum and become problematic as the opening of legislative sessions have been unceremoniously. Usually, the Sergeants-At-Arms announced the opening of session before the start of legislative duties and also has the responsibility to ensure the security of the legislative chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the huge responsibilities assigned to the office of the Sergeant At Arms of the House, it is not clear how the House will function at its regular course, even though Deputy Speaker Barchue said his office as presiding chair of the House during the &quot;State of Emergency&quot; will perform the functions of the Sergeant At Arms until the general Martin Johnson and his staff can return to work. By this, the Office of Deputy Speaker Barchue will perform the role as chief law enforcement officer, protocol officer, and executive officer of the House.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1559 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preoccupation of every Liberian now is how to repel the deadly Ebola virus which has been claiming scores of lives, fomenting panic and threatening to ruin the very future of the nation. This preoccupation is however being distracted by political gimmicks at one point or another, a typical case being the recent report that a group of Liberians, allegedly including prominent members of the Government, have been opting for regime change specifically in favor of an interim arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even while he is reportedly rallying Liberians in the United States where he has been over the last few weeks to pull resources for the fight against the Ebola virus, Minister of State Without Portfolio and Diaspora Affairs, Conmany B. Wesseh, has responded to news of interim government back home with utter disdain. In a dispatcher he sent to the media, a copy obtained by this paper, the longtime political activist said the idea of regime change at this time and linking him and others is an evil distraction. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News has spread in recent time about the forming of an interim government in Liberia to replace the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf administration, and ironically, it is said that some top officials of the very government, including Vice President Joseph Boikai, former Interim Chairman Amos Sawyer and the Minister of State without Portfolio Conmany Wesseh were allegedly in agreement with the plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the Chronicle Newspaper which reported the news was swiftly clawed out of operation and its publisher, Philipbert Brown, is placed under daily police interrogation, those implicated in the alleged regime change scheme are virtually off the hook. There however have been late reports that the National Police had written for permission from the Ministry of Justice suggesting subjecting Vice President Boikai to investigate in line with the reported interim government allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in his dispatch sent from the United States, Liberia's Minister Without Portfolio and Diaspora Affairs, Conmany Wesseh, says such reports are an imagination of those reporting and talking about it. &quot;I am sorry to say that the story can be nothing more than the figment of the imagination of its creator,&quot; Wesseh said, and added: &quot;I think that it is a simple act of mischief designed to distract genuine Liberian patriots and their leaders from fighting the deadly Ebola pandemic that is ravaging our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Minister said he gathered from local news outlets of a Liberian National Police probe into a reported attempt by him and certain very highly and respected personalities to form an interim government in place of the elected serving government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My co-conspirators were named as the Vice President of Liberia, Joseph Nyumah Boakai, Former President of the Interim Government of National Unity of Liberia (1990 to 1994) and Chair of the Governance Commission Dr. Amos Claudius Sawyer and businessman/politician Benoni Urey,&quot; he said in the dispatch. &quot;If it is true that the LNP wrote for permission of the Minister of Justice to probe the 'conspirators', then the agency has smeared its own reputation especially if it had convincing reason for its suggested action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wondered what sense it would make for the Vice President to remove himself from office to install someone else as head of an interim government. &quot;What have Dr. Sawyer, Mr. Urey and I to benefit from this fruitless adventure?&quot; he further wondered, saying that the story presents all of them in the Sirleaf government in a &quot;very childish light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wesseh charged that it appears someone has &quot;successfully hoodwinked our Police to attempt this derailment of the Government from its serious war against Ebola,&quot; promising that he is rounding up his mission to the United States of America where he has been working with Diaspora Liberian and American groups mobilizing medical equipment and supplies to be shipped to Liberia and encouraging Liberian and other volunteers to help fight Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been focusing my campaign on the huge reservoir of Liberians in this country who are doing some extraordinary work for their motherland. This has kept me on the road, going sleepless nights in the Washington DC Metro Area, State of Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota and North Carolina,&quot; Minister Wesseh indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he has met and spoken with Liberian professionals, community leaders and their friends at community centers, churches and offices and had very useful meetings with American political and business leaders, philanthropists and charities on the Ebola pandemic in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The outcome of all of this is beginning to show,&quot; he reported. &quot;Many Liberian-Americans are lobbying their Legislators to support the fight against Ebola. I have no doubt that the passionate plea of our President to President Obama and the American people as well as the intense lobbying power of the Liberian diaspora conspired with the security interest of the United States for the dramatic decision of the US government to intervene in full force to help fight the epidemic. At least two major charities are stocking and loading tons of equipment and supplies for Liberia beginning 20th September.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the political front, the Minister Without Portfolio said his message to all Liberians has been emphatic and clear: that talk of an interim government is a distraction and a stunt of mischief makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All Liberians must join forces to fight Ebola,&quot; he urged and said: &quot;One must be alive to play games. We must commit everything to save lives. The idea of an interim government runs counter to everything necessary to eradicate Ebola, consolidate democracy through elections and pursue development. That message was carried on major news outlets in the places visited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have read in the FrontPageAfrica and The News Newspapers and heard of a Liberian National Police &quot;probe&quot; into a reported attempt by myself and certain very highly and respected personalities to form an interim government in place of the elected serving government of Liberia.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">America Knows How to Fight Ebola</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1250 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not it is a result of President Sirleaf's letter requesting urgent intervention of the world's superpower and Liberia's quasi colonizer, the United States of America, in the fight against Ebola the Liberian leader had said overwhelmed the capacity of her government, President Barack Obama has responded favorably and forcefully to Liberians' tears for rescue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the rhetoric of the promised showdown against this intractable Ebola virus is bellicose: &quot;It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without knowing when the booths of up to 3000 military troops and experts would touch the ground, Liberians must be certainly hopeful that the day of reckoning is near for a vicious virus that has turned life for millions nauseating and nightmarish in the last few months. President Obama made a public declaration of the United States' preparedness to do all the international community can to return life to normal in West Africa, principally worst-hit Liberia. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ebola were a visible enemy force, it would by now be calling for a truce with Liberia and other embattled countries or it would simply begin digging trenches for its own graves. The World's Superpower has spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, this is a daunting task. But here's what gives us hope,&quot; President Barack Obama said in a speech from a situation room in his country. &quot;The world knows how to fight this disease. It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast. We can't dawdle on this one. We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we had not seen before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Commander in Chief however, acknowledged the enormity of the war with Ebola. &quot;Now, here's the hard truth: In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not seen before. It's spiraling out of control. It is getting worse. It's spreading faster and exponentially. Today, thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if the outbreak is not stopped now, &quot;we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us. So this is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security -- it's a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic. That has profound effects on all of us, even if we have not directly contracted the disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said he gathered that West Africa is facing a very different situation, especially in the hardest hit countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone, and in Guinea, from where US experts recently returned, and that the scenes that they described &quot;are just horrific.&quot; He said that iss why, two months ago, he directed his team to make this a national security priority, working this across the entire US government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him the US government has devoted significant resources in support of a strategy with four goals in mind: to control the outbreak; to address the ripple effects of local economies and communities to prevent a truly massive humanitarian disaster; to coordinate a broader global response; and to urgently build up a public health system in these countries for the future -- not just in West Africa but in countries that don't have a lot of resources generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing what he called a major increase in US response, President Obama said, at the request of the Liberian government, &quot;we're going to establish a military command center in Liberia to support civilian efforts across the region -- similar to our response after the Haiti earthquake.&quot; This, he said, is going to be commanded by Major General Darryl Williams, commander of our Army forces in Africa, who has already arrived on the ground in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our forces are going to bring their expertise in command and control, in logistics, in engineering. And our Department of Defense is better at that, our Armed Services are better at that than any organization on Earth,&quot; he promised, and added: &quot;We're going to create an air bridge to get health workers and medical supplies into West Africa faster. We're going to establish a staging area in Senegal to help distribute personnel and aid on the ground more quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are going to create a new training site to train thousands of health workers so they can effectively and safely care for more patients. Personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service will deploy to the new field hospitals that we're setting up in Liberia. And USAID will join with international partners and local communities in a Community Care Campaign to distribute supplies and information kits to hundreds of thousands of families so they can better protect themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the US President promised that his government will also build additional treatment units, including new isolation spaces and more than 1,000 beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their work and our efforts across the government is an example of what happens when America leads in confronting some major global challenges. Faced with this outbreak, the world is looking to us, the United States, and it's a responsibility that we embrace. We're prepared to take leadership on this to provide the kinds of capabilities that only America has, and to mobilize the world in ways that only America can do. That's what we're doing as we speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said further: &quot;Today, the United States is doing even more. But this is a global threat, and it demands a truly global response. International organizations just have to move faster than they have up until this point. More nations need to contribute experienced personnel, supplies, and funding that's needed, and they need to deliver on what they pledge quickly. Charities and individual philanthropists have given generously, and they can make a big difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so we're not restricted these efforts to governmental organizations; we also need NGOs and private philanthropies to work with us in a coordinated fashion in order to maximize the impact of our response.&quot; The US President intoned that this week the United States will chair an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and next week, he will be joining U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to continue mobilizing the international community around this effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And then, at the White House, we're going to bring more nations together to strengthen our global health security so that we can better prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks before they become epidemics,&quot; President Obama said, promising that this is actually something that he had announced several months ago at the G7 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We determined that this has to be a top priority; this was before the Ebola outbreak,&quot; he asserted. &quot;We anticipated the fact that in many of these countries with a weak public health system, if we don't have more effective surveillance, more effective facilities on the ground, and are not helping poor countries in developing their ability to catch these things quickly, that there was at least the potential of seeing these kinds of outbreaks. And sadly, we now see that our predictions were correct. It gives more urgency to this effort -- a global health initiative -- that we have been pushing internationally.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A HEALTHY British woman yesterday became the first volunteer to receive a potentially life-saving new vaccine to tackle the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Atkins, 48, was injected with the experimental drug at Oxford University as part of a safety trial.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If successful, it will be used to treat patients in West Africa where the worst ever outbreak has now killed more than 2,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Atkins, from Marcham in Oxfordshire, is one of 60 volunteers who are taking part in the UK trial over the coming weeks, which has been fast-tracked because of the worsening outbreak. Two more will be given the jab on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being given her injection, she said: I feel absolutely fine, it felt no different to being vaccinated before going on holiday.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Atkins, an NHS communications manager who has also worked as a nurse, will keep a diary of her side effects over the next eight weeks and undergo regular blood tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxford University said the vaccine does not contain infectious Ebola virus material and will not cause those involved in the trial to be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Atkins admitted her friends and family had raised concerns that she was being injected with the virus itself. My 15-year-old son thought it was Ebola I'm having and he asked am I going to die and where is my will and how much do I get? My 12-year-old daughter was concerned but also said, &quot;Well done, Mum for what you're doing.&quot;'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she first heard about the trial while listening to the radio. I volunteered because the situation in West Africa is so tragic,' she added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British nurse who survived Ebola has flown to America in the hope of saving the life of a close friend who has been struck down by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Pooley, 29, will give blood for an emergency transfusion to help the friend, understood to be a doctor who worked with him at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kenema, Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley was discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in London only two weeks ago after fighting off the illness. Doctors at the isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, believe Mr Pooley can help his friend as his blood carries antibodies for the virus, and they are the same blood type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ill aid worker, who is the fourth American to contract Ebola, arrived at the hospital eight days ago from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Foreign Office helped Mr Pooley obtain a new passport after his previous one was burned along with his other belongings on his return from Africa, where he contracted the virus. His mother, Jackie, 66, from Eyke, Suffolk, said: &quot;We are very proud of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: &quot;Following a request from his family, the FCO Consular Team and the UK Passport Office worked together to get a replacement passport to Will Pooley within 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This enabled him to fly out to the US immediately and potentially assist with the treatment of an Ebola victim.&quot; More than 2,500 people have died from Ebola in recent months and almost 4,700 people have been infected, making it the largest outbreak in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of their treatment, patients are given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and antibiotics to bolster their immune systems. The blood of survivors contains natural antibodies that can protect against Ebola. When transferred to another patient, doctors say, the sufferer appears to benefit from the boost to their immune system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aid worker arrived at the hospital eight days ago on a specially equipped plane from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, an NHS worker yesterday became the first person to be injected with a potential vaccine for the Ebola virus. Ruth Atkins, an NHS communications manager from Marcham, Oxfordshire, was injected with the experimental drug as part of a trial carried out at the University of Oxford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is the first of 60 healthy volunteers to take part in the trial of the vaccine, which targets the &quot;Zaire species&quot; of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline, it uses a benign Ebola virus protein to generate an immune response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank said yesterday that the outbreak could drain billions of dollars from economies in West Africa by the end of next year if it is not contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The global development lender predicted that slow containment of the virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone could lead to broader regional contagion, particularly through tourism and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the worst-case scenario, Guinea's economic growth could be reduced by 2.3 percentage points next year, Sierra Leone's by 8.9 percentage points and Liberia's would be hardest hit, with a reduction of 11.7 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama's decision to despatch a force with a strong military component to contain the Ebola epidemic in Liberia is to be welcomed. This is one of those cases where American boots on the ground will be an unalloyed good. Ebola in Liberia is out of control, with the number of those infected doubling and redoubling in a deadly cycle. The already inadequate local health system has been overwhelmed and many care workers have died. Those few who remain are understandably scared they too will perish, particularly as the equipment for effective isolation and treatment of patients is lacking. The Americans will rapidly build a network of clinics, equip them properly, and run intensive courses to train many hundreds of new carers to staff them. In addition they will distribute home-care kits for families so that they can look after their sick relatives. This last measure is problematic because of the ease with which the disease can be passed on if strict procedures are not followed. But the hope is that a campaign of public education can minimise this danger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have been foremost in the fight against Ebola in west Africa, especially Medecins Sans Frontieres, have been calling for such a commitment by developed nations for weeks now. The MSF international president, Dr Joanne Liu, has asked other nations to follow America's lead. Britain, which has a special relationship with Sierra Leone not that different from the one which the US has with Liberia, has announced plans for a centre near Freetown. France, similarly linked to Guinea, is sending 20 experts on biological disasters. China is also sending health workers to Sierra Leone. Apart from such national missions, there is a great need for immediate cash: the amount required has multiplied 10 times, from an estimated $100m to $1bn today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic is at last being treated with the urgency unhappily lacking in its earlier stages. There is good news on another front as well, as trials of an experimental vaccine begin in Oxford. Normally such trials would still be years off, but the threat will not wait on the usual protocols. Since the vaccine is thought to be a particularly safe one - it cannot bring on the disease and any side effects are expected to be limited - the risk of accelerated development is being taken, not least by the volunteers who have come forward to take part. A vaccine could be available for use by the end of the year. If so, we may escape the worst in this particular outbreak. But there are lessons - about readiness, about the proper funding and staffing of the World Health Organisation, and about the need to work on cures for diseases ignored in the past because there were no easy profits to be made by the pharmaceutical industry - and they must be learned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents across Sierra Leone, one of three countries at the centre of the biggest ever Ebola outbreak, scrambled yesterday to prepare for a three-day, unprecedented nationwide &quot;lockdown&quot; in a radical step intended to curb the spread of the killer virus, but which some health experts believe could worsen the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens will not be allowed to leave their homes from tomorrow until Sunday. Known as &quot;ose to ose&quot; in the widely used local Krio, health workers will also go house-to-house identifying cases and raising awareness. More than 2,300 people have died across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the nine-month epidemic that the World Bank warned this week could lead to deaths in the &quot;tens of thousands&quot; if unchecked by the end of the year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 21,000 people have been recruited to enforce the lockdown, bulking up thousands of police and soldiers already deployed to quarantine districts in the worst-hit regions near the border with Guinea. But some international health experts have advised against the move, citing both practical concerns and disastrous attempts at the mass quarantine of the biggest slum in neighbouring Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isolating communities has succeeded in some rural areas in past outbreaks in central Africa. But last month West Point, a sprawling neighbourhood in Liberia's capital Monrovia, exploded in days of riots that led to at least one death after the army poured in, showing the challenges of trying to quell a disease that has never before reached urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you don't want is actions that make the population lose more trust in you,&quot; said David Heymann, who was part of the team that first identified the virus near the Ebola river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. &quot;Trying to cordon off an area isn't rational unless you can enforce it 100%. It's not dealing with the problem the way we know how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rural areas fear and misunderstandings have caused the outbreak to spiral out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF, the medical charity, said it had &quot;concerns&quot; about the lockdown. &quot;We support the idea of increasing awareness about Ebola, but we're extremely concerned about the capacity,&quot; said Cristina Falconi, country coordinator for Sierra Leone. At the 80-bed treatment centre in Kailahun, she said: &quot;I can see all the wards we have here. Every single one is full . . . so I can say that as of today there will not be enough beds for any new cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, Ernest Bai Koroma, is expected to give a speech before the lockdown begins at midnight tomorrow; the government expects to identify up to 20% more cases. Those with suspected Ebola will be taken to holding centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be extremely difficult for health workers to accurately identify cases through door-to-door screening as this requires a certain level of expertise. But critically, even when potential patients are identified, there will not be enough Ebola management centres to care for them,&quot; MSF said in a press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground. This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman in Oxford has become the first British volunteer to be injected with an experimental Ebola vaccine, which, if it works, will be fast-tracked for use in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unprecedented move, the untested vaccine has already gone into mass production. Some 10,000 doses are being manufactured by the British drug company GlaxoSmithKline, funded by the Wellcome Trust and the UK government, which are also supporting the Oxford trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the vaccine is effective there will be supplies available to protect thousands of health workers in west Africa, who will be the first to receive it. Nobody wants a repeat of the ZMapp experience - only a dozen doses were available worldwide of the experimental drug and, controversially, they went mostly to foreign medical and aid workers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first British volunteer is Ruth Atkins, 48, a communications and engagement manager in the NHS from Marcham in Oxfordshire and a former nurse. She heard on the radio that volunteers were needed for a trial run by Oxford University researchers. &quot;I volunteered because the situation in west Africa is so tragic and I thought being part of this vaccination process was something small I could do to hopefully make a huge impact,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hour after the vaccination, she said: &quot;I feel absolutely fine, it felt no different to being vaccinated before going on holiday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atkins is the first of 60 healthy people who will be vaccinated to check for troublesome side effects. Studies involving animals have shown no ill effects so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccine was under development by GSK - it was in the portfolio of Okairos, a smaller company bought by GSK last year - before the Ebola outbreak occurred, but it could have taken a decade to get it through the trials and into production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a growing sense of urgency, with the World Bank warning yesterday that billions of dollars could be drained from economies in west Africa by the end of next year if the epidemic is not contained. The bank has pledged about $200m (&pound;123m) in emergency assistance to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The US announced on Tuesday it would send 3,000 troops to help tackle the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is to provide hundreds of extra beds to treat people affected by the virus as part of a &pound;100m aid package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, confirmed last night work is progressing to provide 200 beds to Sierra Leone and 500 will be supplied to the country by the UK in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four trials of the vaccine will take place simultaneously to gather enough safety data and information on the immune response, which is an indication of whether it will protect against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten volunteers have been injected in the US, where the National Institutes of Health has been funding the development of the vaccine against the Ebola Zaire strain and another against Ebola Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all goes well there will be trials in the Gambia and Mali in healthy volunteers. It is hoped results will be available this year. If the vaccine is effective it will be given to health workers in Ebola-stricken regions. This will be the only way to find out whether it can protect against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, which is running the trial, said: &quot;Developing new drugs and vaccines against Ebola should now be an urgent priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are initial safety trials of the vaccine and it will be some time before we know whether the vaccine could protect people against Ebola. But we are optimistic that the candidate vaccine may prove useful against the disease in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ian Hudson, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency's chief executive, said the trial proposal had been approved with extraordinary speed: &quot;Given the importance of Ebola as a risk to public health in some countries in Africa, we fast-tracked the review of the clinical trial application for this vaccine so that it was assessed and authorised by the MHRA's experts in just four working days.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the Young Women Christian Association is taking different direction in its awareness with special intention being paid to women who she describes as care providers and naming them as the most vulnerable ones in contracting the virus because they are the once who care for their children and husbands at home during their time of illness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A youth club within the Parade Field and Down Street Communities in Caldwell Coffee Farm, outside Monrovia, has invented the bamboo reeds for hand washing in their communities as their contribution in the fight against the Ebola virus.The youth group comprised of about 25 members in the Upper Caldwell District represented by Adolph Lawrence told this paper that out of the 85 houses within those communities, survey showed that only three homes had hand washing buckets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parade Field Community Change Club under the leadership of Benjamin Wollor told this paper yesterday that their innovation came about when the survey showed that out of the 632 dwellers of those communities, 85 percent are unemployed and could not afford the hand washing buckets at the cost of US$10 on the local market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wollor said the group which was established mainly to bring about change in communities thought it wise to help in the midst of no government intervention and on personal fund, to depend on wisdom and thought to use the bamboo reed that is used up country for drinking palm wine since the reed bush surrounded those communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said their idea yielded fruits and that method is presently what is being used in the communities so they have embarked on cutting 90 more of the bigger sizes of the reed stalks where they push a hole through using the zinc nail, and following that they put in disinfectants and place them in positions that the community members could see them and use them for the purpose of washing their hands as part of the preventive measures towards the Ebola awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the youth group said the additional 90 pieces will be planted before the various homes in the community but the challenge is with the sustainability of the process regarding the Clorox and chlorine and soap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wollor said they are calling on well-meaning community members as well as others interested in the prevention of the spread of the Ebola virus to help them succeed in the project. He also said they are also seeking assistance for six barrels to place them at the six strategic entry points of the communities to be used for hands' sanitization purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has put in place other strategies for sustainability including gardening and soap making so that proceeds from their work could enable them purchase more disinfectants adding, 'After Ebola, trauma will be high and we want to continue to support mainly children who lost their families to this virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parade Field Community Change Club was established on January 1, 2014 with the aim of reshaping the lives of the young people. It has been engaged in spreading HIV and AIDS messages, connected a community bridge linking Parade Field to Thumbs-Up and is conducting community services every first Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is currently using the town crier approach to sensitizing the communities against the spread of the Ebola virus as well as its prevention methods.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairperson of the Liberian Civil Society Taskforce on Ebola, Mr. Oscar Bloh says the deadly Ebola virus is winning and International response to Ebola outbreak has been slowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloh disclosed that the many hospitals in the country are over-run and under- staffed with fear and panic sparking serious violence while borders have also been closed and ships prevented from coming to the country. He said Liberia is running out of food and other essential things.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Bloh, after months of inaction in recent days, donor pledges had been made ,but Liberians still have the fear that it will take too long for government promises to translate into hands to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloh told journalists yesterday that the CSO Task Force and international groups are calling on wealthy countries around the world and International Organizations such as the United Nations (UN), to accelerate the deployment of much needed resources aimed at stemming both international health crisis and a threat to regional peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 870 people are believed to have died from the current epidemic in Liberia with hundreds of deaths reported in Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone,&quot; Mr. Bloh explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it is regrettable, frustrating and disheartening to see health workers on strike with clinics abandoned and communities lacking basic preventive measures like clean water and soap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the CSO Ebola Task Force is calling for significant medical, financial and logistical support such as protective gears, equipment, ambulances and helicopters to transport suspected victims and dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSO further said logistical and financial support will enhance remote and quarantined communities to get food and clean water and that will also help to carry on some sanitization efforts to assist reduce the spread of the deadly Ebola virus that is claiming the lives of many people in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSO says the deadly Ebola virus is winning and therefore a great effort should be made to combat the disease and kick it out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">805 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf says the comity of nations has a stake in ending the Ebola crisis and said, &quot;I will not rest until Ebola is defeated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader spoke these words when she welcomed the 3,000 U.S military troops into Liberia to assist the government in its fight against the Ebola virus in the country and noted that American partners have also realized that Liberia cannot defeat Ebola alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Liberians are resilient and strong despite they are suffering greatly from the outbreak of the disease and hoped that the decision of the United States Government will sprout the rest of the international community into action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said the disease is not simply a Liberian or West African problem. She described the announcement made yesterday by the U.S. Government of its direct military assistance as a significant moment in the battle against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Liberia and the US have maintained a historic friendship and that Liberia is looking forward to working closely with the U.S. in finalizing those plans and deploying new resources to their maximum effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday evening, U.S. President Barack Obama announced at the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention new steps to be taken in the coming weeks to combat the growing epidemic in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said a U.S General will lead the efforts from Monrovia and that the military personnel in the region would increase by 3, 000, the U.S will plan and construct treatment centers that would house up to 1, 700 beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Government also committed more than $100 million to combat Ebola and that it will call on Congress to approve an additional $ 88 million as part of a bill to fund the Federal government while the Pentagon said it is working to shift $ 500 million of currently not yet obligated funds toward the Ebola effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Government's gesture will include an increase in trained medical professionals to be sent to help and at the same time medics and other uniformed professionals will train up to 500 health care workers per week to identify and care for people with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also of that gesture, are 400, 000 treatment kits with sanitizers and other items to at-risk homes in an attempt to contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Sirleaf has reinforced her earlier message of fighting back in the national fight against the Ebola virus and has reiterated her government's commitment in seeking every solution by sparing no effort in defeating this vicious enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the nation late yesterday, President Sirleaf said Liberians have only one choice and that is, together they can all win this fight against Ebola that has left many children as orphans and is at the brink of destroying livelihood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the play button on Liberia's target for transformation needs to be released because the outbreak of the virus has placed everything on pause leaving the government to act within the scale of capacity that was unexpected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She announced that her government will take clear actions in the coming weeks to reverse the spread of the virus and each Liberian should take responsibility for all, noting that the government will ask for all the international help but unless Liberians themselves take responsibility this problem will not go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader said the next few weeks will be crucial because the Center for Disease Control and Prevention will release its trajectory report and urged all Liberians to be realistic and accept the scientific projections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it is her hope that the scenario projected by the CDC does not come to pass because there is hope in a collective and individual ability. She therefore thanked all Liberians particularly the nurses and doctors for the brave decision to save lives as well as the burial team that is doing its best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf promised that early next week she will show her gratitude beyond words as she also commended the AFL, BIN and LNP in the fight against the virus. She also thanked President Obama and the U.S. Government for scaling up America's response to fighting the virus in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Lofa and Montserrado Counties have been the highest hard hit in the Ebola crisis and said so far 2535 cases have been reported and confirmed with 1328 deaths; 172 being health workers while 82 have been announced dead leaving over 100 orphans, declaring it a 'health emergency.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said her government had already begun putting investments into operations, progressing to improve the health system, seeing hike in the number of airlines at the Robert International Airport, building roads and reducing infant mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stated further that her government needs to get schools opened, produce more to get out of poverty, care for the orphans and respond to families.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Bar Association has paid tribute to victims of the Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An executive of the association, Cllr. J Bima Lansanah said, it is time that Liberians and foreign residents soberly reflect on the carnage caused by the deadly disease and coordinate their activities in the fight to contain the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the Liberia National Bar Association at the Temple of Justice during formal opening ceremonies of the Civil Law Court Monday, Cllr. Lansanah said it is not only a matter of sophistication, but a simple hygienic procedure that needs to be practiced by every Liberian and foreign residents to contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while it may seem difficult to avoid traditional practices including shaking hands, bathing dead bodies, converging in large numbers for traditional feasts, among others, those practices must stop for now in order to get rid of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Cllr. Lansanah has reiterated the need for the creation of additional divisions of the Civil Law Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the capacity of the current Civil Law Court is limited to adjudicate and dispose of cases pending before the court for determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told judges, lawyers, party litigants and other members of the public who attended Monday's opening ceremonies that until this is done, the court will continue to experience extreme difficulties in disposing of cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes the contribution from the Government of the United States of America to significantly build upon their previous Ebola response in West Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new commitment provides support to the United Nations and other international partners to help the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal in their work to contain this outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This massive ramp-up of support from the United States is precisely the kind of transformational change we need to get a grip on the outbreak and begin to turn it around,&quot; says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backbone of the US response is military leadership and the establishment of a regional command and control in Monrovia. The approach includes a military staging base to facilitate the coordination of the American and international response and to expedite the transportation of equipment, supplies and personnel including up to 3,000 from the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, engineers will construct additional Ebola Treatment Units in affected areas and establish a site to train up to 500 health workers per week to care for patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps will deploy 65 health workers to support the previously-announced, state-of-the-art hospital that will be placed in Monrovia to provide care to health workers who become sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO Ebola response roadmap, released on 28 August, highlights the need for a massively scaled response to support affected countries. The commitment from the US Government exemplifies the kind of international effort required to intensify response activities and strengthen national capacities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Bomi in Tubmanburg was gutted by fire on August 26, leaving the equipment entirely damaged with portion of the building burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a team of reporters following the donation ceremony Wednesday, IREX Chief of Party, Bill Burke said the donation was intended to allow the station provide information to the people of Bomi in this time of crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Burke said information dissemination is important in the ongoing fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IREX Chief of Party said the equipment will help the station to educate and create awareness amongst the people about the virus in that part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast equipment include one five hundred and fifty (550) watts radio transmitter, desk top computers, recorders and other equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Bomi County Superintendent Samuel Brown said the reopening of the station will contribute greatly to the ongoing Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Awareness was not going on, preventive messages were not being heard and I believe that was one of the things that increased our death toll... so this station has been very important to us&quot; Supt. Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the reopening of the station will immensely contribute to decrease in the Ebola suspected deaths in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Bomi Station Management Zinnah Cassell said the equipment will boost the station's broadcast in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cassell said the station previously operated on 300 watts and was covering the three counties in the region, including Bomi, Cape Mount and Gbarpolu.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the death of Capt. James Morlu, Deputy Speaker Hans M. Barchue has told the Sergeant At Arms at the House of Representatives General Martin Johnson to quarantine himself by staying away from the Capitol Building.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instruction from the Deputy Speaker which also includes the staffers of Gen. Johnson followed news of the death of Capt Morlu, a door keeper to the Chambers of the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt. Morlu reportedly died from the Ebola virus recently at the Redemption Hospital in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to his death, Morlu showed signs and symptoms of the virus. Family members have rejected claims that Morlu died from the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Legislative reporters following hours of meeting with staffers in the Sergeant At Arms' Office Wednesday, Deputy Speaker Barchue said Johnson and staff have been advised to stay away from the Capitol for the rest of September for observation as a mean of taking precautionary measures against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still trying to confront whether it was Ebola or not; as you are aware when one dies and the technicians come and take specimen, it takes days before the result can come. So we are still awaiting result from the Ebola people,&quot; Deputy Speaker Barchue indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said decision to ask the Sergeant At Arms and his team to stay away is due to the close working relationship they had with the late Morlu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Speaker Barchue noted that these measures are intended to safeguard the Capitol Building, lawmakers and other people who have to come to work on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Gen. Johnson and staffers will be monitored by the World Health Organization Contact Tracing Team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that the House of Representatives announced the suspension of Tuesday's session to allow its Chambers and surrounding offices to be disinfected due to a probable case of Ebola, following Morlu's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO Contact Tracing Team had earlier advised the Sergeant-At-Arms and all Chamber door keepers who the late Morlu directly interacted with prior to his death to isolate themselves for the period of 21 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-level delegation from an international social justice and health organization, Partners in Health (PIH), is in the country to hold discussions with relevant partners on the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease. The delegation, led by the co-founder of the organization Paul Edward Farmer, is jointly in Liberia with a partner institution, Last Mile Health (LMH).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the objective of the team's visit includes seeking the guidance of the Government on the proposed set of immediate response programs to be implemented by the coalition in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the County Health Teams, including managing an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in southeastern Liberia as well as scaling up community-based interventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will also discuss strategies for ensuring that the global response works to strengthen national and county-level institutions by building local capacity (public and private, including for community-based care for Ebola and other diseases).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Mile Health, also known in Liberia as Tiyatien Health, is delivering comprehensive community-based health care and health systems strengthening in remote regions in Liberia, particularly in Grand Gedeh County. The group also builds capacity at the national and county levels and support partners in Government in strengthening and improving national community health policy and practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partner in Health works in several countries throughout the world including Haiti, Rwanda, Lesotho, Mexico, Malawi, Peru, Russia, United States, among others to provide a preferential option for the poor in health care. They strive to achieve the overarching goal of bringing the benefits of modern medical science to those most in need of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farmer is an American epidemiologist, an anthropologist and physician who is best known for his humanitarian work providing suitable healthcare to rural and under-resourced areas in developing countries, beginning in Haiti. Farmer is formerly the Presley Professor of Medical Anthropology in the Department of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. He is also an attending physician and Chief of the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was named chairman of Harvard Medical School's Department of Global Health in 2009, succeeding Jim Yong Kim, his longtime friend and collaborator, who was appointed President of the World Bank in 2012. The delegation will also hold talks with President Sirleaf. They depart Liberia on Saturday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">720 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Innocent Project Africa (INPA), the criminal justice system and judicial &quot;watchdog&quot; of Africa has warned that it will be a serious political miscalculation for anyone to dream of the arrest and investigation of Vice President Joseph Boakai and others on account of their alleged involvement with the formation of interim government in the diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement issued Monday, the INPA argued that it is absolutely inconceivable as to why a sovereign constitutional Vice President who is elected on the same ticket as the President under Article 51 of the 1986 Constitution of Liberia would support an interim government that will undemocratically oust him from power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the group, any interim government into the country will also see the Vice President down from the vice presidency, saying that the vice president need not therefore be a subject of police investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Criminal Watchdog group says it is politically worrisome to note that the Inspector -General of the Liberia National Police, Col. Chris Massaquoi, an executive appointee, to recommend the immediate arrest and investigation of Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai as it is being speculate in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculations in the City have it that Col. Massaquoi has not only recommended the arrest and investigation of Vice President Boakai, the LNP boss also called for the arrest and investigation of other officials including Mr. Conmany B. Wesseh and others on allegations of being part of a proposed interim government for Liberia. But the INPA noted that while such malicious rumors may be considered as baseless, it is however important to warn those contemplating such action whether real or perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group accentuated in its press statement that those contemplating on the arrest of the Vice President and others to be reminded of the dangerous consequences of political in-fighting and the repercussion of unduly toying with the constitutional rights of others under the pretext of proving their loyalty to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The allegations contained in the purported communication allegedly written by the Inspector-General of Police, an appointee of the Executive,&quot; the Criminal Justice Watchdog Group indicated, &quot;are the handiworks of blackmailers, extortionists and belly -driven pranksters and agent provocateurs who want to use the EBOLA crisis to make money on the tears of innocent people... .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criminal justice watchdog group says it is troubled by the fact that in the last few weeks, there has been an arbitrary exercise of power by state security agencies, leading to the unprovoked invasion and closure of the offices of the National Chronicles Newspaper by the Liberia National Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also named as another arbitrary action by state security actors, &quot;the wanton assault and wounding of several citizens in West Point as well as the cold bloody murder of little Shaki Kamara by a contingent of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These horrific events perpetrated by agents of the Government of Liberia, INPA said, are nothing but a complete distraction from plans aimed at developing a cohesive approach to combat the deadly Ebola virus that is taking away the precious lives of Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purported communication written by the Inspector-General of Police allegedly recommends the arrest and possible investigation of Vice President Boakai, Conmany Wesseh and others, the group maintained, is counterproductive to the current democratic process. INPA reiterated its warning therefore, that it will be a serious political miscalculation for anyone to dream of such action at this time of our national history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group then called on President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to beware of belly-driven loyalists who will say things they don't mean; who, in order to mask out their impotencies and cowardice, will manufacture the most asinine schemes to ruin good relations subsisting between and among friends for pecuniary purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be a serious political miscalculation and perhaps the last nail in the coffin of national unity were President Sirleaf to accept any suggestion gear at arresting and investigating the Vice President of Liberia on trumped-up charges that are triggered by the desire to make quick money,&quot; the statement signed by Edwin K. Martin, managing director of the group concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">552 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President John Dramani Mahama has frowned on countries, isolating Ebola affected countries terming it as not the best way to jointly fight the disease. According to an Executive Mansion release, the Ghanaian President said isolating countries will further compound the precarious situation, especially trade and commerce thereby seriously affecting the economies of these countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama, who is also current chairman of the sub-regional organization, ECOWAS, made the assertion when he addressed a joint press conference during a one-day solidarity visit to Liberia on Monday, September 15, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian leader informed the media gathering that there have been lots of international commitments to fight the disease, but said, turning these commitments into actuality was too slow and encouraged donor countries to fast track their commitment since it's intended to save lives in an emergency situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama said he was in Liberia to join the advocacy for more international concerted efforts in eradicating the virus out of the sub-region. He praised the courage and determination of the Liberian Government and its people in defeating the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chairman of ECOWAS, the Ghanaian leader said he has begun consultations with world and continental bodies as well as airlines that have stopped flying to Liberia and other affected countries to begin plans to re-engage the Liberian authorities in overturning their isolation as the affected countries have now put into place World Health Organization (WHO) recommended measures in order to stop the spread of the virus to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affected countries, including Liberia, have put into place a vigorous health check including temperature reading at all ports of entry/exit as recommended by WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a demonstration of how Ghana is prepared to help affected the countries, President Mahama disclosed that he has held discussions with the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki- moon to allow his country's capital, Accra, to serve as a transit center for international flights bringing in logistics, medicine and relief items for the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf described Ghana as a sisterly country that has always been by Liberia during good and bad times. On behalf of the Liberian Government and the people, she expressed appreciation for the role being played by Ghana and President Mahama, in his capacity as chairman of ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf hoped Liberians will continue to work together for the total eradication of the Ebola virus. The Ghanaian President also made stopovers in Freetown, Sierra Leone and Conakry, Guinea with similar messages of solidarity in their respective fights against the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama was met upon arrival by Vice President Joseph N. Boakai at the Roberts International Airport. They proceeded to Monrovia and joined President Sirleaf at her Foreign Ministry office for closed-door discussions before addressing the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian President was accompanied by his Health Minister, Dr. Kweku Agyeman; Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Ambassador Kwesi Quartey; Senior Advisor to the President, Alhaji Baba Kamara; and the Director of State Protocol, Ambassador Kwame Tenkorang- Asamoah.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA announced yesterday that it would send 3,000 troops to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, as health officials warned that $1billion in aid spending was needed to bring the virus's spread under control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following criticism by aid agencies that the international response has been &quot;lethally inadequate&quot;, Washington said it would dispatch the soldiers to Liberia, the worst affected of the countries hit by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission, led by a US general, is the biggest US deployment to Africa since the ill-fated humanitarian mission to Somalia in 1993. It will help provide logistical support to a country whose health service has effectively been destroyed by the outbreak, with hundreds of doctors and health workers infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the mission's priorities will be building 17 100-bed health-care facilities; another will be training 500 new health workers a week to help deal with infected patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The goal here is to surge American expertise, including our military, logistics and command-and-control expertise, to try to control this outbreak at its source in West Africa,&quot; Lisa Monaco, Barack Obama's White House counter-terrorism adviser, said, ahead of an expected announcement by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations has warned that up to 20,000 people across West Africa could be infected by Ebola by the end of the year, with some aid agencies predicting the true figure could be twice that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid agencies have warned that the scale of the outbreak in Liberia is threatening the stability of the country, which was formed by freed American slaves in the 19th century and wrecked by civil war between 1989 and 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medecins Sans Frontieres, the main agency operating specialist Ebola treatment clinics in Liberia, said that up to 30 patients per day are being turned away due to lack of beds at its new facility in the capital, Monrovia, raising the risk of them infecting other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Liberian hospitals have closed because of the number of health workers infected, leaving the country's four million people with no emergency medical help. Anger among Liberians at the lack of response has led to health workers being attacked by mobs. In a report released yesterday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that $987.8million (&pound;600million) was needed to contain the outbreak, which has claimed 2,461 lives. The report added that $23.8 million (&pound;14.1billion) was needed simply to buy body bags and pay the burial teams who collect victims' bodies, which remain highly infectious after death. &quot;This health crisis we're facing is unparalleled in modern times,&quot; said Bruce Aylward, assistant director general of the WHO.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost $1bn (&pound;620m) is needed to contain the Ebola epidemic raging across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which could infect up to 20,000 people if unchecked by the end of the year, the UN warned, as the US pledged to send troops to help contain the world's biggest ever outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If not dealt with effectively now, Ebola could become a major humanitarian crisis in countries currently affected,&quot; Valerie Amos, the UN humanitarian chief, told reporters in Geneva. The capacity of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to provide even the most basic necessities was, she warned, &quot;on the brink of collapse&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stark warning was echoed by other health bodies at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Tuesday, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) emergency chief, Bruce Aylward, saying the outbreak was &quot;unparalleled in modern times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know where the numbers are going,&quot; he said. He said two weeks ago that when the WHO said it needed the capacity to manage 20,000 cases &quot;that seemed like a lot. That does not seem like a lot today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US said it would send 3,000 troops to help tackle the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, US president Barack Obama said the outbreak was &quot;a threat to global security&quot; and called on other countries to act quickly to provide help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people affected, with profound economic, political and security implications for all of us,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regional centre run by the US army in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, where the outbreak is spiralling out of control fastest, will coordinate efforts to build more than a dozen treatment centres and train thousands of healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,400 people have died from the virus in this outbreak. A few cases have been recorded in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. All 26 previously recorded outbreaks have been contained largely by isolating patients but the WHO said cases would continue to rise for at least six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO said about $987.8m was needed for everything from paying health workers and buying supplies to tracing people who had been exposed to the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids such as blood, urine or diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign medical teams with up to 600 experts, as well as at least 10,000 local health workers, are needed to stem the outbreak, the global health body has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About $23.8m is needed to pay burial teams and buy body bags, since the bodies of Ebola victims remain highly infectious and workers must wear protection suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the US's latest effort will come from $500m allocated for overseas contingency operations, such as the war in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This humanitarian intervention should serve as a firewall against a global security crisis that has the potential to reach American soil,&quot; US senator Chris Coons told the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has also requested an additional $88m from Congress to fight Ebola, including $58m to speed production of the ZMapp experimental antiviral drug and two potential Ebola vaccines. The US classifies Ebola as a bio-terrorist weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has borne the brunt of the epidemic, recording 1,224 deaths as of 6 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$88m: Additional amount the White House has requested from Congress to fight the Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 2,400 people</SPAN></P>

Kennedy Medical Center (JFK) has recorded at least 83 Ebola deaths and 60 survivors over the last three weeks, a consultant of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Ebola Case Management has said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Atai Omoruto said as of August 17, the JFK Ebola Treatment Unit, headed by a team of Ugandan doctors recorded at least 146 Ebola suspected patients, including 71 males and 78 females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the 5th discharged program of 16 Ebola survivors at JFK Monday, Dr. Omoruto said out of the 146 patients, 85 were confirmed of the Ebola virus, 32 cases were suspected while 26 cases were tested negative of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said 60 of the patients have been discharged over the last three weeks while 83 died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO Ebola Case Management Consultant said most of the 83 patients who died were either dead on arrival or at the point of death before being taken to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said out of the 83 deaths, 36 were males and 47 females. Ebola kills 90 percent of its victims, according to the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the Ebola survivors, Joseph Baker, an employee of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) said they survived at the mercy of God and tireless efforts of the Ugandan and Liberian doctors assigned at the ETU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Death came to us face-to-face and we only made it by the grace of God and these doctors... God first and our doctors came second; our Ugandan and Liberian doctors... &quot; Mr. Baker joyfully stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they were fed four times daily while undergoing treatment at the center. This report was made possible through the Liberian Media Center/IREX program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 100 Liberians languishing in prisons in the United States and Canada stand the risk of deportation to Liberia. The disclosure was made in Washington D.C. by Liberia's Ambassador accredited to the United States, Jeremiah C. Sulunteh, during a congressional hearing that brought together a cross section of Liberians in the diaspora and some members of the United States congress to discuss the current Ebola crises and the immigration status of Liberians on the Deferred Enforcement Deportation (DED) which expires in September of this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian envoy told attendees at the congressional hearing on the Ebola epidemic that about 50 Liberians that have committed different offenses and are currently incarcerated in Canada are awaiting deportation while another 64 are also listed for deportation to Liberia from the United States criminal justice system. '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ambassador Sulunteh, this brings the total number of Liberians listed for deportation from Canada and the United States to 114.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that with the current health crises in the country, the Liberian government, through its representation in both Canada and the United States, are working with immigration authorities to delay the deportation proceedings, noting that the deportation proceedings if executed will be a burden on the government and people of Liberia at this critical time in the history of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He informed guests at the program that the Liberian government was seeking an alternative to the deportation proceeding by appealing to the governments of the United States and Canada to engage the Liberians listed for deportation into rehabilitation programs that would make them productive citizens, instead of deporting them to Liberia that is already devastated by the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When immigration authorities were contacted both in Canada and the United States, they confirmed the presence of the Liberians in prison both in the United States and Canada. Immigration authorities in the two countries said as law enforcement institutions, they were authorized to arrest and turn over individuals who violate state law for legal action against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration authorities in the two countries said if Liberians are found guilty of crimes committed, they would serve their respective prison term and later deported to Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Public Works Minister Atty. Samuel Kofi Woods has called on the government to re-open the National Chronicle Newspaper and halt all further intimidation of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods in a statement also called on the government to lift all restrictions on the freedom on the paper's publisher to travel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that the state of emergency in Liberia should not be used by government and its security forces as a shadow or pretext for the violation of individual and collective rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods said a state of emergency imposed to address a health crisis should not be used to shoot people and to restrict press freedom and freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods condemned the shooting of Shaki Kamara allegedly by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia, as well as the closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper; terming these actions as overreaching, heavy handed and unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is calling on the Government of Liberia to commission an independent inquiry into circumstances leading to the shooting and killing of Kamara and the bullet wounds suffered by another citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Public Works Minister insists that the inquiry should also examine the constitutionality of the blanketed state of emergency, the use of the security forces during this national health emergency, as well as their deportment and exercise of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the work of the independent panel must also consider the future role of security and military personnel in non- military crisis, and the improvement of the psychology and capacity of security forces to deal with matters of civil engagements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can we impose a national state of emergency, quarantine entire swaths of our population, restrict the movement of our own people, but at the same time criticize other countries and even airlines for imposing similar restrictions on our citizens,&quot; Woods argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods: &quot;Without any doubt, the Government's policies and actions appear uncoordinated, fragmented and fraught with contradictions. This has led to increased distrust in our national government and lack of national ownership of the on-going fight against the Ebola Virus&quot;, the renowned human rights activist averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that some of the recent policies of government constitute what he terms as &quot;moral sin and ethical transgression against the poor and weak in our society,&quot; emphasizing that government must return to the drawing board to review some of those policy options, in the hope of restoring confidence and re-energizing the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of the Liberia Medicine Health Products Regulatory Authority (LMHRA) says the sale of harmful drugs on the Liberian market has reduced significantly to at least 10 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. David Sumo attributed the reduction of harmful drugs on the market to his organization pro-activeness in monitoring the importation of drugs by importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named the Abeer pharmacy as one of the importers of drugs to have begun the sale of dreadful drugs, something he said is not unique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained the lack of logistics and human resource capacity is impeding the effectiveness of the LMHRA to carry on its mandate as a regulator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that there are over 41 licensed drugs importers in the country and less than 20 of said number are active in drugs importation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LMHRA director indicated that it is important for consumers to be educated on the purchase of drugs because most of the medication on the market is not healthy for consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The LMHRA has observed with grave concern that in the wake of our fight against the deadly Ebola virus outbreak in the country, some medications have surfaced on our pharmaceutical markets that are not safe for consumption,&quot; Director Sumo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the role of LMHRA in the fight against the Ebola virus, Director Sumo said the authority is conducting public awareness to all pharmacies and the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the fight against Ebola virus is not individual's fight but a national emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We carry out public awareness to combat the Ebola virus, in fact, we have engaged pharmacies and medicines stores across Monrovia and its environs to ensure that the public takes the required preventive measures as advised by the health sector&quot; Sumo stressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What appears to be an Ebola fear has grabbed Legislators and staffers at the Legislature following the death of one of the Chamber door keepers at the House of Representatives, Capt. James Morlu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt. Morlu died recently at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town, following a brief illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information gathered by this paper reveals that Morlu was suspected of showing signs and symptoms of the virus, and that his body is presently in the possession of the Ebola Team for testing to ascertain the exact cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement, the House of Representatives said it was suspending its Tuesday's Session based on medical advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the statement under the signature of the House's Press Bureau Director Isaac Redd, the suspension of the session would allow the House's Chambers and surrounding offices to be disinfected due to a probable case of Ebola, but did not confirm the source of the probable Ebola case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Members and Chamber Staff have been asked to stay away during and forty eight (48) hours after the chlorination. The Chief Clerk of the House, Hon. Mildred Siryon has been instructed to communicate the House's decision to the Honorable Liberian Senate,&quot; the statement indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our Legislative reporter, those who might have had close contact with the late Morlu have been advised by the World Health Organization Contact Tracing Team to isolate themselves for 21 days while it makes effort to ascertain the case of Morlu's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key among the Capitol Building employees being advised by the WHO Contact Tracing Team are the Sergeant At Arm at the House of Representatives, General Martin Johnson, and all Chamber door keepers who the late Morlu directly worked with prior to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday at the Capitol, a Contact Tracing Focal Person at the World Health Organization office in Liberia, Madam Edvida Penn told General Johnson and others who may have had direct contact with the late Morlu to isolate themselves from their families and the Capitol Building for the period of 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to be home for 21 days; all those that worked closely with this man have to be quarantined,&quot; Madam Penn advised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid intense local and international efforts to contain further spread of the Ebola virus, the Coca-Cola Company is making tremendous progress aimed at further containing the virus in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Company, which has been attracted by worsening humanitarian crisis in the Region in the aftermath of the unprecedented outbreak of Ebola, has demonstrated commitment to ensuring that the crisis is under control through the donation of assorted medical supplies, save drinking water and cash, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in continuation of such effort, the Coca-Cola Company in Liberia, together with its bottling partner, Equatorial Coca-Cola Bottling Company (ECCBC), on Tuesday, September 16, 2014, presented additional medical supplies to the Ministry of Health in the amount of US$48,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplies, which were requested by local hospitals, according the Company, include personal protective equipment, such as latex gloves, gowns, face shields, face masks and shoe covers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation to the National Taskforce on Ebola, the Human Resource Manager of the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC), Atty. Gabriel A. Johnson said, &quot;the immediate delivery of these supplies is critical in protecting the health workers who can help to slow the spread of this disease but this is just the first shipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Johnson added that following the first air-shipment, the LCCBC and its partner, ECCBC had ordered two more forty-foot containers of medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Coca-Cola Company has provided $200,000 through its Africa Foundation to procure medical equipment and supplies to support the efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria&quot;, he disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, in addition to the next delivery for Liberia, both Sierra Leone and Guinea, will each receive two more containers and one will be delivered to Nigeria. The LCCBC has also been providing beverages, water, juices, thermometers, cash &amp; buckets/faucets and bleaches in support of the Ebola crisis management effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also working with local healthcare and relief workers to broadcast important messages about prevention and good health practices at home to contain the spread of the disease&quot;, Atty. Johnson noted. &quot;If someone feels unwell it's important to seek medical attention from trained health workers at clinics and hospitals rather than risking exposure to the family&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the LCCBC's Human Resource Manager said the donation is part of the company's commitment to supporting where it is operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past 4 years, The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation has donated over $2million worth of medical equipment to countries across Africa, including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, Gambia and many others,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in response, Mr. Dorbor Jallah on behalf of the National Taskforce, praised the Coca-Cola Company for its tremendous effort aimed at sustaining the fight against the deadly virus and promised that that equipment would be properly distributed to targeted beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Government has designed a number of strategies aimed at helping West African countries affected by the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States President Barrack Obama has stated that Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the humanitarian crisis there is a top national security priority for the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said in order to contain and combat the virus, the U.S Government was partnering with the United Nations and other international partners to help the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Senegal respond just as the country fortify its defenses at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, President Obama said the U.S strategy is predicated on four key goals which include controlling the epidemic at its source in West Africa; mitigating second-order impacts, including blunting the economic, social, and political tolls in the region; engaging and coordinating with a broader global audience; and fortifying global health security infrastructure in the region and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States has applied a whole-of-government response to the epidemic, which we launched shortly after the first cases were reported in March. As part of this, we have dedicated additional resources across the federal government to address the crisis, committing more than $175 million to date,&quot; President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the United States will leverage the unique capabilities of the U.S. military and broader uniformed services to help bring the epidemic under control, and that the efforts will entail command and control, logistics expertise, training, and engineering support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States President disclosed that the U.S. Africa Command will set up a Joint Force Command headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia, to provide regional command and control support to U.S. military activities and facilitate coordination with U.S. government and international relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, a general from U.S. Army Africa, the Army component of U.S. Africa Command, will lead this effort, which will involve an estimated 3,000 U.S. forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Africa Command he noted, will establish a regional intermediate staging base (ISB) to facilitate and expedite the transportation of equipment, supplies and personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama further said the Command engineers will build additional Ebola Treatment Units in affected areas, and the U.S. Government will help recruit and organize medical personnel to staff them, as well as establishing a site to train up to 500 health care providers per week, enabling healthcare workers to safely provide direct medical care to patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is preparing to deploy 65 Commissioned Corps officers to Liberia to manage and staff a previously announced Department of Defense (DoD) hospital to care for healthcare workers who become ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the deployment roster will consist of administrators, clinicians, and support staff, and that simple and scalable strategies that complement the use of Ebola Treatment Units are urgently required to disrupt the disease's transmission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">644 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every Day, Reports about the Ebola epidemic and the human calamity it continues to inflict on the already fragile population is simply frustrating and unbearable. The epidemic has taken an estimated 2,218 lives out of 4,366 cases in West Africa, particularly in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia where more than 1,000 people have died of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of an 'exponential rise' and it seems figures released by the U.N. agency confirm that the situation is very grimed. The Liberian government has clearly indicated that it lacks the capacity to deal with the situation that requires international intervention and expertise to prevent a human catastrophe at this time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As The Death rises, the Liberian government has beseeched the United States government to rescue the West African and other countries devastated by the virus in the subregion. The Liberian government is serious about fighting Ebola but there are some administrative weaknesses and serious capacity gaps in delivery of much needed Ebola materials to hospitals, clinics and isolation centers. The lack of capacity seriously undercut the effectiveness of government's ability to cope with the alarming situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding, The Good news is that the United States government is sending 3,000 military personnel to Liberia and other West African countries. The soldiers are expected to train medical staff and engage in other positive initiatives. As stated by President Barack Obama during a television broadcast on NBC recently, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the humanitarian crisis is a top national security priority for the United States. In order to contain and combat it, President Obama said his administration will partner with the United Nations and other international partners to help the Governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Senegal respond &quot;just as we fortify our defenses at home.&quot; He added that every outbreak of Ebola over the past 40 years has been contained, and we are confident that this one can--and will be--as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such An Assertion from President Obama is a testimony of his commitment and support to strengthen and ensure that a genuine partnership with Africa is harnessed, not only in good times, but especially, in terrible times like these. Stretching beyond borders to save humanity from the scourge of an atrocious disease is perhaps the greatest goodwill any powerful nation can provide to a dying people. The U.S. government says their strategy is predicated on four key goals: controlling the epidemic at its source in West Africa; mitigating second-order impacts, including blunting the economic, social, and political tolls in the region; engaging and coordinating with a broader global audience; and fortifying global health security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, The United States has applied a whole-of-government response to the epidemic, which &quot;we launched shortly after the first cases were reported in March. As part of this, we have dedicated additional resources across the federal government to address the crisis, committing more than $175 million to date. We continue to work with Congress to provide additional resources through appropriations and reprogramming efforts in order to be responsive to evolving resource needs on the ground. Just as the outbreak has worsened, our response will be commensurate with the challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Declaration By President Obama is an opportunity for the Liberian government to explore and ensure that it provides all the necessary support and cooperation at this critical time. The Ebola fight exceeds all national issues because it is about saving lives. Therefore, we urge the government and other individuals and groups not to provoke unwarranted issues that are not in line with the goals and objectives of the U.S. government in fighting Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during donation ceremony at the Corporation Hall in NewKru town, the President of FOBY, Mr. Sonsala C. Parson, said the Federation has been involved with a lot of anti-Ebola awareness and sensitization activities amongst resident of the district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">773 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the initiative by the &quot;Special Ebola Response Team&quot; (SERT) of the New Water in the Desert Assembly, a one-day community awareness training for seventy participants from nine community-based youth organizations were conducted on the 4th of September, under the Theme: Ebola Volunteerism and the road to an Ebola free Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective of the one day Ebola response strategies workshop which involved the headquarters congregation of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church in Liberiawas to collectively discuss the issue of Ebola and advanced collective ideas to fight and eradicate the pestilence from Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the renewed outbreak of the deadly virus in Liberia, the church has been intervening through the provision of community awareness, personal protective gear to health centers, food and non-food items including over 200 bags of rice to vulnerable persons and quarantine centers in several counties, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop, which was facilitated by the Political Officer of the United States Embassy near Monrovia, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, focused on the following topics; (a) What is Ebola?; b. How is it spread: (c) How to prevent it? And, (d) what can Liberian youths do in the overall fight against Ebola? Other related topics deliberated on by the soft-spoken, eloquent speaker were: (a) What is Volunteerism? (b) Volunteerism in Community Development and (c) The Role of the Youth in building a Peaceful, Prosperous Liberia which was opened for general discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his presentation, Mr. Chamberlain highlighted several points for his youthful audience to be aware as they fight Ebola. He indicated that Ebola is hard to get - primarily transmitted through touching sick persons or dead bodies diagnosed with having Ebola; but when gotten, it's hard to do away with; that Ebola is an animal bond disease; that majority of the experts sent from the US Center for Disease Control - CDC to fight Ebola in West Africa are in Liberia; that Ebola is only passed or transmitted to someone when the signs and symptoms are being shown and that is Ebola is not spread through the air and water</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US envoy also noted that many people are afraid of isolation centers, but emphasized that the best way to be treated is to isolate oneself when diagnosed with the disease, adding that &quot;being infected with Ebola is not a death sentence and that learning about Ebola is the best thing for Liberian Youths to join the fight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the questions and answer period, the participants made several recommendations in order to enhance their role in the fight against Ebola and the way forward. Amongst the recommendation were and putting in place increase in awareness mechanism (by means of jingoes, broadcasting messages in the vernacular, house to house visitation, dramatization in public places, etc.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Youth also recommended conducting trauma healing and counseling programs for relatives of Ebola victims available at the community level; increased community awareness trainings for volunteers to join the fight against the deadly virus and involving survivors of Ebola virus in the awareness activities in the various communities to give people hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also recommended were the youth groups identifying mini projects that will somehow help in the fight of Ebola and afterwards begin a massive community initiative; organizational networking in the collective fight against Ebola and other community initiatives and involvement in the anti-Ebola drive of community leaders, elders, religious groups, etc, into community based programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the close of the workshop, the pastor of the church encouraged youth to step out and enhance the fight against Ebola. Rev. Dr. Kortu K. Brown, who is also the general overseer of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church, reminded his youthful audience that to prioritized by local communities including the youth to win the war against Ebola, adding, &quot;all Liberians must get involved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Brown therefore called on stakeholders to encourage communities to join the fight and not focus the intervention on the national level. Meanwhile, New Water in the Desert Assembly is working with local churches in Banjor Community in District 17 to ward off the threat post by Ebola to that community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youth groups which participated in the workshop include Greater Academic Students Association, Adrem (To the Point) Intellectual Forum, Diompelor Social and Athletic Club, Youths in Action for Education and Development, NWIDA Youth Fellowship, Young Women Professionals, Yellow Flower Youth Organization, Perry Town development association, Wilson Corner Youth Association, amongst others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victoria G. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">596 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of the Seamen Port and General Workers Union (USPOGU) says exploitation has caused fishing vessels that operated in the country to withdraw at the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, calling for review of West Africa Regional Fisheries Project 2010 regulation to be preoccupied with the prevention of the spread of the Ebola epidemic that imposing huge fees on vessel owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's executive pointed out that more than 100 fishermen have been put out of a job due to the unceremonious departure of vessel owners operating in the country. Addressing a news conference in Monrovia recently, Mr. Gueh blamed the departure of the ship owners were based on the West Africa Regional Fisheries Project 2010 regulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists that the WARF project is managed through the Fisheries Management office of the Bureau of National Fisheries at the Ministry of Agriculture. According to him, the regulation increased the monthly salary of US$300 to US$900 that the vessel owners were paying to the Bureau's observer assigned on-board each ship. On the issue of US$900 salary, Mr. Gueh said that the shipowners were also forced to pay US$100 as salary to the Bureau's inspector also assigned for each of the vessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the regulatory demands vessel operators to give to the Bureau, 10% of funds generated from every fishing trip they would make at sea, noting that he these are some of the regulations that have forced most of our investors, especially those in the fishing industry, to leave the county with their vessel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the pull out of vessel owners from the country, he explained that most of the fishermen are left without a job. &quot;What I want you to know today is that the Global Ocean Fisheries Corporation is owned by a Korean national is the only fishing vessel that is currently operating in the county&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he accentuated that the Union had over 10 vessels prior to the regulation that were operating in Liberia which employed over 1000 Liberians that have now lost their jobs. He wondered, with these fees paid tearfully, how do you expect the investors to make a profit when they also have to pay their crews and purchase fuel for vessel? How do you think foreign company will operate in your county under such condition?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Liberian government needs to intervene and help save the people from joblessness, emphasizing, &quot;we need to reconsider the regulation [because] it is not in the interest of our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, those out of a job have dependents, the Seamen boss noted, saying as of now, only Lebanese business people who are importing fish in the county thereby making the price of fish to increase in the county. When contacted by this paper, an executive of the Bureau of National Fisheries only identified as Kaye could not deny or confirm the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to make any comment on the issue, I advised you to go to the MOA; they are responsible to address such issue and not the Bureau&quot; he said. Kaye also said the Bureau of National Fisheries is an autonomous agency operating directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WARFP regulation was developed with the support of the World Bank, the Global Environment, the Africa Catalytic Growth (ACG), to sustainably increase the wealth generated by the exploitation of Liberia's marine fishery resources and the portion of the wealth captured the local economy. It was intended to strengthen the capacity of Liberians to govern and manage targeted fisheries, reduce illegal fishing and increase local value added to fish portion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama has called on the international community to expedite support and resources to Liberia to enable her adequately tackle the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama, who is also the current Head of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said portion of the resources should be made available to the Liberian Government to enable it to undertake necessary programs to tackle the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The resources are coming in very slowly,&quot; the Ghanaian leader said in a statement in the foyer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when he paid a one-day solidarity visit to Liberia on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on African leaders to avoid instituting panicking measures that will isolate peoples and countries that are affected by the disease because it will make it more difficult for the virus to be brought under control. President Mahama also admonished them to institute tougher screening measures at their sea, land and airports allow normal economic activities to go on rather than to close them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already, Ebola is going to have an impact on the economy of the entire sub-region; the more restrictive measures we take the graver the impact it will have on our economy,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stand in solidarity with the government and people of Liberia. We have agreed to use Accra (Ghana) as a center for receiving logistics and personnel for onward dispatch to Liberia as a way of accelerating the process of putting the virus under control, President Mahama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf thanked her Ghanaian counterpart for the visit, saying &quot;We will always remember you for your continuous concern, encouragement and support to the Liberian people. Thank you for all you have done to help us combat this deadly virus.&quot; While in the country, President Mahama donated 150 bags of rice, 100 cartons of milk, 100 cartons of chocolate, and 100 cartons of oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Mahama's delegation included the Minister of Health, Dr. Kweku Agyeman, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Amb. Kwesi Quartey; Senior Advisor to the President; Alhaji Baba Kamara and Director of State Protocol Kwame Tenkorang-Asamoah.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">527 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of State without portfolio, Ambassador Conmany B. Wesseh has called for the intervention of International Experts to assist the country in the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus that has plagued Liberia during the past months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Ministry official also appealed to friendly countries and foreign business partners in Liberia to remain operational even in the face of the present heath emergency, noting that the suspension of flights to Liberia due to the Ebola outbreak could be against the fight to eliminate the disease from the country. Ambassador Wesseh spoke recently to foreign partners and Liberians in USA where he had gone to lobby on behalf of the government and people of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it will not serve a useful purpose to isolate Liberia due to the outbreak of the Ebola; instead he advised that medical support to Liberia be increased to help the country contain the deadly virus disease not only from the Mano River Union basin. He lauded the U.S Government and other friendly nations for their speedy intervention in the fight against this strange disease; noting that the country is facing difficulties with containing the Ebola viral disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Ambassador Wesseh said the present Ebola situation in Liberia has posed a major challenge that has continued to overwhelm the capacity of the Liberian Government to combat it. Minister Wesseh said the Ebola situation in the country has grown to the point where the government alone cannot fight the virus, and has therefore called on friendly countries and international partners to make substantive efforts in assisting the government to combat the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the government has made tremendous efforts since the outbreak of the Ebola disease in the country, the Minister of State without Portfolio, said the country continues to be faced with many challenges that need international assistance to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the Agriculture fare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Wesseh indicated that medical experts are urgently needed in Liberia to join their local counterparts to combat the virus, stressing that the level of the outbreak sends a strong signal to all Liberian citizens and partners to engage. The government, he explained, would not achieve its objective of driving the Ebola virus out of the country unless the international community and donors stand by Liberia in the fight against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the fear of the Liberian Government has been the rapidness with which the disease is spreading may affect every productive sector and wipe out a very significant portion of the population if nothing is done by the international community, saying that any further delay in the intervention may cause the entire sub-region to collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Minister without Portfolio, a son of River Gee County, is urging all Liberians irrespective of tribe, creed, religion, or political affiliation to stop politicizing the Ebola issue in the country. Mr. Wesseh reiterated that this is not the time for blame-shifting, asserting that the time has come for all to see the fight as a national battle aimed at containing the spread of the virus and eliminating the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional centre in Liberia will coordinate efforts to train health workers and build treatment centres to help tackle crisis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US said it would send 3,000 troops to help tackle the Ebola epidemic that has raged for nine months, overwhelming fragile health systems in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regional centre run by the US army in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, where the outbreak is spiralling out of control fastest, will coordinate efforts to build more than a dozen treatment centres and train thousands of healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2,400 people have died from the deadly virus, for which there is no approved cure. A handful of cases have been recorded in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. All 26 previously recorded outbreaks have been successfully contained largely by isolating patients, but the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday that cases will continue to rise for at least six more months in an epidemic that has jumped borders and erupted in urban areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO said about $987.8m (&pound;609m) is needed for everything from paying health workers and buying supplies to tracing people who have been exposed to the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids like blood, urine or diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign medical teams with up to 600 experts, as well as at least 10,000 local health workers, are needed to stem the outbreak, the global health body has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About $23.8m is needed to pay burial teams and buy body bags, since the bodies of Ebola victims are highly infectious and workers must wear protection suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the US's latest effort will come from $500m from overseas contingency operations, such as the war in Afghanistan, which will instead be reallocated to west Africa and Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This humanitarian intervention should serve as a firewall against a global security crisis that has the potential to reach American soil,&quot; US senator Chris Coons told the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has also requested an additional $88m from Congress to fight Ebola, including $58m to speed production of the ZMapp experimental antiviral drug and two Ebola vaccine candidates. The US classifies Ebola as a bio-terrorist weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troops will take about two weeks to be deployed, with Barack Obama expected to give further details after a visit to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has borne the brunt of the epidemic, recording 1,224 deaths as of 6 September. M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, the medical charity leading the fight against Ebola, has repeatedly said the international community's response has been &quot;lethally inadequate,&quot; amid a shortage of everything from burial teams to surgical gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are honestly at a loss as to how a single, private [non-governmental organisation] is providing the bulk of isolation units and beds,&quot; MSF president Joanne Liu said in a speech to the UN in Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Highly infectious people are forced to return home, only to infect others and continue the spread of this deadly virus. All for a lack of international response,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called on countries with biological-disaster response capacity, including civilian and military medical capacity, to dispatch specialist medical units to west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruggero Giuliano, MSF medical coordinator in Liberia, said plans were under way to double capacity at the organisation's 200-bed facility before ramping up to 1,000 beds. &quot;There are many days where we need to close the [centre's] gates and leave patients outside. The problem isn't building facilities - it's staffing them. You need experts to run the place, people need to be highly trained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Cuba and China have said they will send medical staff to Sierra Leone. Cuba will deploy 165 people in October while China is sending a mobile laboratory to speed up testing for the disease. Health workers in Kenama, in Sierra Leone's badly-affected eastern region, said they were using plastic bags amid a shortage of basics such as rubber gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak has rippled beyond the health sector, prompting spending cuts across the board as all three countries struggle with rising inflation and drops in productivity. Liberia and Sierra Leone's fragile postwar economies will shrink by 3.5% this year, the IMF said, meaning less money is likely to go into vital infrastructure and education projects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Non-Governmental Organization-THINK-INC. last Friday made several donations to the ELWA Police Station, the ELWA Gas Station, ELWA Markets and other several communities with pig feet barrels, buckets, tile-soap and Clorox worth over hundreds of United States Dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation at the ELWA Police Station, THINK Gender Focus Person, Joan K. Dalton, expressed with deep solace the level of destruction being carried out by the deadly Ebola virus. she said since the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in the Country, nearly all sectors of the Liberian society have been hit, with either the loss of lives, while several other persons are admitted at various centers and are currently being cared for by health workers and some communities quarantined to help curtail the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Dalton lauded the efforts of the Liberia National Police for the great job it is doing currently to help curtail the high risk of community residents contacting the virus, saying, the Police have been placed on the frontline to work along health workers find sick persons with the virus to be taken to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She further disclosed that the Police should carry out the arrest of criminals and armed robbers who are silent carriers of the virus and believed it was necessary to aid them in the fight of the Ebola virus at least by extending those preventive materials which she said will help the Police with the washing of hands that she said is very cardinal to prevention of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, the Commander of the ELWA Police Station Depot 8 Chief Superintendent, McClain Taipeh, lauded the efforts of Touching Humanity In Needs of Kindness (THINK) for the donation and promised to convey those messages of felicitations to his Boss, Col. Chris Massaquoi who he said has been in the vanguard of sensitizing people on the importance of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ELWA Police Boss also lauded Madam Rosana Schaack who through her efforts has made the donation to them. He also thanked her for the many donations made in other parts of the country with a little resource.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other areas benefiting from the donations were a mini business center at the ELWA Gas Station and the ELWA Market which have been one of the closest places to the ELWA Ebola Center.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of fear amongst citizens of non-affected countries in the wake of the deadly Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, Ghanaian President, John D. Mahama has ended a one day visit to Liberia. President Mahama is the first President to visit the West African country that now has the highest number of Ebola cases since the outbreak of the epidemic in Liberia in early March. The Ghanaian leader briefly met his counterpart, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before addressing a joint press conference yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama, who spent less than two hours in the country, expressed optimism that with determination, awareness, the Liberian people will be able to reciprocate. President Mahama said his visit is mainly about the observation of the guidelines by the Ministers of Health of the Economic Community of West African State (ECOWAS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;From the onset of the outbreak of this disease, actions and measures were taken out of panic. Now that we have a clearer understanding of the disease and how it spreads and all of the ramifications; we should not panic or take measures that will isolate countries that are affected by this outbreak because by doing that will make it more difficult for the disease to be brought under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mahama said, &quot;I believe that as long as all of us are instituting proper screening mechanism, we can allow normal economic activities because Ebola is going to have an impact on the economy of the sub-region, and the more we take measures that restrict economic activities, the graver the effect of the economy on our country is going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said as Chairman of the West African regional body ECOWAS, he has received a lot of response and promises of resources but pointed out that those resources are very slow in coming. &quot;I have spoken to the Secretary General of the UN and offered that we use Accra as a center for handling logistics and personnel into your countries. The Secretary General accepted, and I know that the process is on,&quot; Pres. Mahama further disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, Mr. Mahama said his country stands in solidarity with the people of Liberia and believe that sooner rather than later, as predicted by some, the deadly disease will be brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, President Sirleaf lauded President Mahama for his visit at the time Liberia is going through a period of difficulties. Madam Sirleaf praised the ECOWAS Chairman for being in solidary with Liberia when the country is being devastated by the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thank you for your personal visit which follows the telephone conversations I have had with you; we thank you for your support and encouragement you have given to us in our conversation; we will always remember that you stood by us in our times of need,&quot; President Sirleaf said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, has praised the Fula Community in Liberia for its contribution towards the national fight against Ebola in the country noting that Ebola will not dictate the country's future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items donated were three Nissan double cabin pick-ups, 500 bags of 25 kg rice, 900 cartons of water (large/small), 140 pieces of mattresses, 500 cartons of bath soap, 100 cartons of Clorox, 100 cartons of lucozade, 100 pieces of garbage baskets, 250 bags of tissues and 100 sacs of powdered soap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the huge donation from the community to the National Task Force now transformed into the National Consultative Group, President Sirleaf referred to the gesture as 'significant contribution that passed all' and that it showed where the hearts of the Fulas in the country's development process are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said these are difficult times in the country and added that Liberia has seen more difficult times before but that the Ebola virus will not win this fight if every one puts their hands in it to fight and win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader explained how the Task Force has been transformed to a consultative group with all branches of government represented but the main technicians are those in the health sector who do most of the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned against people playing with the dead apparently with the understanding that the Fulani are majority Muslims who bathe the dead as part of their tradition for fortune, therefore she emphasized, &quot;control the body business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-chairperson of the National Consultative Group, Speaker Alex Tyler said the donation demonstrates that the Fulani Community stands by the government during these troubling times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola knows no boundary. It is a treat that all of us must face and even though other communities have identified with this fight, we hope that other communities will join in like manner,&quot; Speaker noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is time that any partner should desire to stand with the nation and urged Liberians to continue to listen and follow the preventive rules adding, &quot;By doing so Ebola will certainly be eradicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambassador of the African Women Entrepreneur Program (AWEP), Rugie Barry urged Liberians to stop criticizing government during this fight against Ebola. She said the government did not bring Ebola on its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the keys of the three vehicles and the other donated items to President Sirleaf, Amb. Barry said the fight against Ebola can be won when everyone work together as a team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She acknowledged the Fula Community's full participation in the fight to eradicate the virus from the country and said some medical supplies worth US$9, 075 are being processed for clearing at the National Port Authority as additional donation to the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Fula Community members present at the donation were the president of the Fula Business Association, Alhaji Bella Diallo, the Assistant Director for External Operation at the National Security Agency, Alieu Bah, Alhaji Mustapha Balde, Rouguiatu Jalloh, Asatu Bah-Kenneth and Osman Jalloh, among others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">567 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Elections Commission (NEC) has clarified that it still remains committed to its recommendation for the postponement of the October 14, 2014 Special Senatorial Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission says it has been holding series of consultations with important stakeholders including authorities at the Legislature and there is a likelihood of conducting the Election any time before January, 2015 in order to meet the constitutional date for the seating of senators to be elected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towards this end, the Commission was informed that the joint Legislative Committee on judiciary has been instructed to study the legal basis for the postponement of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission's clarification comes against the backdrop of a report by the Voice of America Radio quoting the Chairman of the Commission, Cllr. Jerome Korkoya, as saying both Houses of the Liberian Legislature have mandated the Commission to hold the October 14, 2014 Special Senatorial Election as scheduled, despite the current Ebola outbreak in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission in a release says it had earlier written both Houses of the Legislature and the President of Liberia informing them that given the grave nature of the Ebola outbreak in the country and the effect that such disease could have on the conduct of the pending Special Senatorial Election, a free, fair, and credible Special Senatorial Election on October 14, 2014 will not be possible for the following reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Given the constraints imposed by the national health emergency in the wake of the contagious Ebola Virus Disease, the Commission will not only be inhibited in fulfilling its mandate to recruit, but also to undertake the training of more than 25,000 temporary polling staff for deployment in the 4,701 polling centers across the country; 365 civic civic/voters educators for deployment throughout the 73 electoral districts spread across the 15 counties of Liberia as well as 400 electoral supervisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission's IT staff will not be able to go around the country to rehabilitate and connect internet facilities for the transmission of elections results; The Commission is required to internationally procure ballot paper printing services for the printing of 2,640,000 ballot papers, 78,750 mock ballots and 5,000 polling kits, all of which have to be flown into the country. The timely delivery of these materials, most of which are sensitive, cannot be guaranteed in the wake of the current wave of the suspension of flights to Liberia; Under the present circumstances, political parties and senatorial aspirants in particular, would not be able to effectively conduct their campaigns, given that this part of the electoral process entails great deal of interactions, including physical contacts among candidates and their supporters, which is usually characterized by large gatherings,&quot; NEC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission believes that mass movement, deployment and gathering of people, which is an inseparable characteristic of every democratic election, will not be possible without contravening current measures put in place by the government in the fight against the Ebola Virus Disease and further exposing more Liberians to the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC says these conditions are substantive enough to justify the postponement of the October 14, 2014 Election. Meanwhile, NEC says a new date for the conduct of the Special Senatorial Election will be announced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Association targeted Montserrado, Bong, Lofa, Margibi, Grand Gedeh and River Gee Countries through its peer educator and staff in collaboration with various health teams, National Task Force and other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a release, the Planned Parenthood Association of Liberia with support from its partners IPPF, BMZ, UNFPA and IRC, provided hygiene kits to all of its beneficiaries across the country as well as equipment to all of its facilities with sanitary materials including hand washing buckets, disinfectants (chlorine), clorox, soap, hand sanitizers and gloves, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release said the Association's team visited 12 urban markets in Monrovia and its environs conducting awareness as well as distributing sanitary materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release further said PPAL organized training for all its mentors under the IRC SOS project which was conducted by the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release pointed out that constraints faced by the Association's Ebola Team in the leeward counties were misinformation on the spread of the virus, insufficient flyers for awareness creation, denial of the virus existence and hospitals refusal to accept patients which is preventing citizens from attending to health facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear of having the Ebola virus disease has led a Liberian woman living in Lagos to commit suicide by hanging herself in Lagos last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, identified as Kate, decided to hang herself in the early hours of Friday after falling sick and thinking that what she suffered from was the Ebola Virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident caused confusion on Bankole Street, Isheri-Oke, when residents woke up to the sight of a woman hanging on a tree, wearing a black sweater and orange skirt. It was gathered from the residents that the woman did not live on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents who spoke on condition of anonymity said she was a Liberian who worked in a sachet water factory before she died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they said the woman had been sickly for some time, residents said she did not appear to have any problem with anyone in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the outbreak of the Ebola disease that was brought to Nigeria by a Liberian, Patrick Sawyer, some of the people in the area opted not to have anything to do with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the residents who pleaded anonymity said, &quot;We see her in this neighborhood every day. She always looked sick but people stopped selling to her after the Ebola outbreak. It could be because she was a Liberian and looked sickly. This might have frustrated her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another resident said, &quot;She attended a church in the area and her church members still saw her yesterday. I used to see her every day in the dress she died in. She was sick and people in this area avoided her, especially after the Ebola outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted, the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Ngozi Braide, said she was not aware of the incident and promised to check with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Minister of Health Professor Oyebuchi Chukwu, while making a speech during a requiem Mass held in memory of late Dr. Stella Adedevoh on Friday at Holy Cross Cathedral, Lagos, confirmed the report that a South African woman had been quarantined in Lagos for having symptoms of Ebola,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Oyebuchi advised Nigerians to always look out for fresh cases of Ebola because Nigeria is not yet free from the disease until there was no trace of Ebola in Liberia, Guinea, Congo, Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister explained that the Federal Government decided to shift school resumption date because of the need to train teachers on how to take care of pupils in schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola Disease remains the number one killer for now and it could continue to rage havoc unless it is contained within the most reasonable time. No one knows exactly when the disease would be eradicated within the West African sub-region. As long the virus remains active and continues to spread in the sub-region, it poses a serious threat to our survival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Our Government is struggling to deal with the Ebola spread, the Chairman of the National Elections Commission (NEC) says both houses of the national legislature have informed the commission to hold the special senatorial elections next month as scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Last Friday during an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Cllr. Jerome Kokoya said he had written the legislature asking for a postponement of the October 14 election to December this year, saying his commission could not hold a free, fair, and credible election because of the ongoing deadly Ebola crisis. He said consultations are continuing on the holding of the elections in October which the Liberian constitution says must be held on the second Tuesday in October. However, Chairman Kokoya said some lawmakers have expressed concern that by not having the elections [at all] could create a constitutional crisis, which could have wider consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have decided that we must hold elections. The question they are working on now is the technical side of it. The Judiciary Committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate were meeting, and we were told by the Speaker that by early next week, we're going to have some information from them with respect to the date. Like us, they too want the election to go on this year so as to avoid any serious constitutional issues come January,&quot; Kokoya told the VOA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based On The mandate from lawmakers, Kokoya said he would begin publishing the final listing of candidates by this week or next week. However, he acknowledged that there are challenges under the current situation with the Ebola disease having a potential effect on the population and the suspension of several flights to Liberia due to Ebola crisis could make the election even more expensive or perhaps inconsequential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Much As Liberians respect the constitution which provides for holding special senatorial election in October, the Ebola crisis has overshadowed the spirits of the election and makes the entire contest inconsequential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right Now, Most Liberians, if not all are frightened by the human calamity caused by the Ebola virus. Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that there would be an &quot;exponential&quot; rise in the cases of Ebola particularly in Liberia if 1,000 beds are not made available to deal with the worst Ebola disaster in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawmakers Must understand that we are at war and our government does not have the capacity to deal with the current situation that has overwhelmed us. A constitutional crisis is not important than the survival of our people. What good is the election when people are dying? How can you hold election when the population has been advised against touching or coming in close contact? The human destruction from the Ebola crisis is unimaginable; therefore, those suggesting the holding of the election in October are callous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Believe There will be sufficient time to hold a national conversation on constitutional issues. For now, we must eradicate Ebola first.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leadership of the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) last Friday paid a courtesy call on President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, an Executive Mansion release has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the meeting, PUL President Abdullai Kamara assured the Liberian leader that the Union remains a part of the National Taskforce and are playing the role it can but with very limited support and resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Ebola virus outbreak has also affected every sphere of the media landscape with newsprints and advertisement all running low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Union is also concerned about freedom and rights issues during the outbreak and is prepared to work with government to address outstanding freedom and right issues concerning the media,&quot; Mr. Kamara emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He used the opportunity to raise the issue about the closure of the National Chronicle newspaper and support for community radio stations across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kamara thanked President Johnson-Sirleaf for accepting to meet with them and thanked her for the effort government is making thus far in trying to contain the further spread of Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, the Liberian leader welcomed continuous engagement with civil society groups such as the PUL and others on a routine basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She agreed with the PUL that community radio stations must be supported to enable them play their role during this critical health crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader urged the media not to heighten the fears of Liberians and the international community by their reportage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed the PUL that the issue of the National Chronicle is before the courts and will be resolved within that context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although President Sirleaf claimed that the issue of National Chronicle Newspaper is before the court but the Liberia National Police are still investigating the paper's publisher Philipbert Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper's license was suspended by the Ministry of Information pending the outcome of the probe. The comment by President Sirleaf indicates that she is not aware that the matter is still languishing at the LNP headquarters on Capitol Hill and not the Temple of Justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">580 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Herv&eacute; Ladsous has assured President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf that the United Nations remains on the side of Liberia in the wake of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the UN is prepared to support ongoing international efforts led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated that WHO has taken the initiative to mobilize the entire UN system and beyond to effectively respond to the outbreak with the aim of containing further spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease in the sub-region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Currently, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon has taken advantage of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly to engage different levels of world leaders and is committed to doing all he can to stop the epidemic,&quot; Mr. Ladsous noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the UN Under-Secretary General made the statement when he met with the Liberian leader at her Foreign Ministry office recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ladsous conveyed deep feelings of Mr. Ban about the current Ebola epidemic in Liberia and other countries in the sub-region. &quot;My visit to Liberia is also to express the solidarity of the Secretary-General and to assure President Sirleaf of the UN system's commitment to help mitigate the risk placed on the hard won gains made in Liberia so far. I am here to sit with you and the Government on how we can more effectively help the situation,&quot; Mr. Ladsous said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, President Sirleaf thanked the UN Under-Secretary-General for his visit to Liberia and recounted previous visits including that of the UN Systems Coordinator on Ebola, David Nabarro and others to help respond to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader described the Ebola virus as an unknown enemy to the Liberian setting, making it critical to the respond efforts. &quot;Our collective response is yet to catch up with the acceleration rate of the virus thus far, but concrete efforts in strategic partnership with the international community and international responders are now in place to mitigate the situation,&quot; President Sirleaf pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf briefed Mr. Ladsous about several initial measures taken by the Government including the closure of schools, entertainment centers, video clubs, etc. and noted that cultural and traditional practices also remain at the heart of efforts to break the transmission of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She, however, expressed hope that the end will come soon as there are so many success stories associated with the release of more survivors from the treatment centers across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our regular healthcare system was hard hit by the outbreak and needs support and attention to be able to respond to the growing number of non-Ebola cases that are also adding to the death rate in the country. We are working with our partners to fully restore regular healthcare, and the UN's involvement is encouraged,&quot; President Johnson-Sirleaf urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President pointed out that the Ebola outbreak is having serious consequences on the country's economy, and assured that the government is working with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others to mitigate the situation now and the post-Ebola period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed Mr. Ladsous that the security situation in the country so far remains calm, and pointed out that the desire of training more personnel in the security sector, particularly the police was on course but now restrained by the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">'Stop Abusing State of Emergency' - Woods</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1299 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early fears about the declaration of a state of emergency by Government to contain a vicious pestilence were that it would be used to prey on unsuspecting individuals and groups, particularly dissenting voices that the Government has got eyes on for a long time and that it would set loose marauding armed men upon the civilian population. The fears have not proven unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In less than a month of the declaration, the fears found legitimacy in the cow-boy styled knockdown of the Chronicle Newspaper and the gunning down of an adolescent youth West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has alarmed, though not surprised, members of the Liberian human rights community who understand the traits and behaviors of Liberia's military and police forces and had predict the perversion of the state of emergency. Now another prominent member of the community, Kofi Woods, currently visiting the United States is warning against continued abuse of the state of emergency. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Public Works Minister now Legal Consultant of the Liberia Law Society is warning that the state of emergency in Liberia should not be used by the government and its security forces to violate individual and collective rights of the people. Woods, one of Liberia's renowned human rights lawyers, urges Government not to use the state of emergency imposed professedly to address a health crisis to militarize the country and to restrict press freedom and freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the remarks, according to a dispatch from the United States, while speaking to journalists. Woods used the occasion to condemn the shooting to death of Shaki Kamara, a youth in West Point, by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia, as well as the closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper; terming these actions as overreaching, heavy handed and unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the Government to commission an Independent Inquiry into the circumstances leading to the shooting and killing of Kamara and the bullet wounds suffered by another citizen. Woods also called on the government to re-open the Chronicle Newspaper and halt all further intimidation of the Press, including the restriction on the freedom of the Chronicle's publisher to travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods insists that the Independent Inquiry should also examine the constitutionality of the blanketed state of emergency, the use of the security forces during this national health emergency, as well as their deportment and exercise of force. He noted that the work of the independent panel must also consider the future role of security and military personnel in non- military crisis, and the improvement of the psychology and capacity of security forces to deal with matters of civil engagements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights lawyer also strongly criticized the declaration of the state of emergency, noting that it lacks specificities as to its purpose, scope and limitations, as required by the Constitution of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He questioned the constitutionality of the President's declaration of a state of emergency; noting that while Article 86 (a) of the Constitution grants the President the power to declare a state of emergency, Article 86 (b) clearly states that: &quot;A state of emergency may be declared only where there is a threat or outbreak of war or where there is civil unrest affecting the existence, security or well-being of the Republic amounting to a clear and present danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods noted that the best way to deal with the Ebola emergency while at the same time avoiding a constitutional crisis, stigmatizing the country and population and giving security forces the perception that they have the liberty to trample the rights of citizens is to use the Public Health Law, as opposed to the imposition a sweeping constitutional state of emergency with no specific objectives, targets and benchmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can we impose a national state of emergency, quarantine entire swaths of our population, restrict the movement of our own people, but at the same time criticize other countries and even airlines for imposing similar restrictions on our citizens,? Woods argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods maintained that the Ebola crisis is a national public health emergency that must be dealt with as such, but noted that political decisions and considerations continue to dominate real health decisions and programs. In a health emergency, we must listen to the health experts and health workers to guide our decisions and actions and revert to other legal/constitutional actions only where the public health law proves inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without any doubt, the Government's policies and actions appear uncoordinated, fragmented and fraught with contradictions. This has led to increased distrust in our national government and lack of national ownership of the on-going fight against the Ebola Virus&quot;, the renowned human rights activist averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods noted that some of the recent policies of government constitute what he terms as &quot;moral sin and ethical transgression against the poor and weak in our society,&quot; emphasizing that the government must return to the drawing board to review some of those policy options, in the hope of restoring confidence and re-energizing the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has recommended the review of all policies and parallel actions to address the suffering of the poor. This includes the current restrictions on freedom of movement, health interventions, humanitarian intervention and other issues. &quot;As a nation and people, now is the time for us to begin to address with urgency, the moral, legal and ethical imperatives heighten the fight against Ebola, restore the hope of our people, and assure them that this too shall come to pass, Woods, observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamenting the death of Dr. Abraham Borbor whom he referred to as a schoolmate, Atty Woods expressed his condolences to the bereaved family and maintained that the Liberian Government is under obligation to conduct a full-scale medical inquiry on the use of the experimental drug (ZMAPP) and bring to closure any doubt associated with its application. The former Public Works Minister has made a number of recommendations to Government in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst other thing, Mr. Wood called for a review all actions and the term of reference of the National Task Force and restructure the national framework for policy, action and implementation; prioritizing the needs and demands of health workers and practitioners. Those at the forefront of this fight continue to complain of neglect thus victimizing the foot soldiers and a review and restructure and National Health Team led by the Ministry of Health. Bold decisions need to be taken in the regards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also urged government provide an initial financial update on all income, contributions and expenditures made to the fight against Ebola to date; develop task-sharing pathways assigning unto itself the monitoring and evaluation component of the fight while existing INGOs and their national counterparts, including the Liberian Red Cross must be empowered to do the implementation; and that 85% of salaries, allowances and benefits in higher brackets (Executive, Legislative and Judiciary) must be sacrificed for three months during the emergency to provide for the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a real sacrifice demonstrate that they too can sacrifice to help rescue our country, the human rights advocate said, adding: &quot;All non-essential civil servants must be retrained and redeployed to assist with the fight against Ebola. The crisis with volunteers won't be occurring if the already paid civil servants are re-deployed and that there should be no negotiations and sale of oil blocks and concessions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development and in support of the appeals made by Dr. Jerry Brown of ELWA, he has donated a laptop through CASE-Liberia and will send some drugs to assist the treatment center.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Brumskine Provides Aid to Ebola-Fighting Institutions</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1034 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency relief efforts to contain the deadly Ebola virus, as it was during the civil conflict, have largely been concentrated in Montserrado County, understandably because the casualty figures are high in this urban province of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But death tolls are also climbing in the countryside and there is evidently little nor no major concentration in terms of external assistance. Charles Walker Brumskine, the political leader of the opposition Liberty Party has discerned the disparity. Over the weekend, he was in Bong and Nimba Counties where he delivered much needed assistance. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the weekend, and following a meeting with President Sirleaf and other opposition political parties where she rallied all Liberians to assist in the fight against Ebola, Liberty Party strongman Charles Walker Brumskine was in Bong and Nimba Counties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He entered Gbarnga, Bong County on Friday, September 12, 2014, along with the county's Senator Franklin Siakor, where they presented several consignments of rice to be distributed to quarantined communities in Gbarnga: Civil Compound and Millionaire Quarters. They also delivered rice to the association of disabled persons in Gbarnga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to The Analyst in Gbarnga, Cllr. Brumskine said that he decided to visit Bong County in order to identify with the people as he has been doing in other counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his presence in Bong as well as Nimba counties, where he visited Saturday, would make a difference in the lives of some of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumskine said if only one life was saved because that one person's trust him and the belief in the need to do things differently, his trip is worth the while. He implored all Liberians to follow the instructions of the medical experts, adding, &quot;We will overcome this national catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard bearer emeritus of the Liberty Party emphasized that every Liberian needed to embark on a personal crusade within the limit of the capacity of their resources to complement government and the international community's efforts to rid Liberia of Ebola. Counselor Brumskine called on Liberians to stop doubting the existence of Ebola in the country and take advantage of preventative measures recommended by the World Health Organization, (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a cross session of Bong County citizens Friday, September 11, 2014 in Gbarnga, Counselor Brumskine said he was in the County to identify with citizens amidst deadly Ebola virus disease outbreak in the County. According to the Bong County Health Team, the virus has killed more sixty persons in the county, including health care providers and ordinary citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselor Brumskine said Bong County is centrally located and hosts thousands of Liberians from different parts of the country and therefore called on residents of the county to join efforts in combating the deadly Ebola virus diseases that continues to devastate the country. He noted that his visit to the county was the beginning of series of visits he intends to do in Bong County in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of his visit to Bong County, he provided 65 five bags of rice to the Bong County branch of Liberty Party for distribution to quarantined quarters in the county. It can be recalled that the LP strongman on August 16, 2014 provided LD$100,000 to the Bong County Health Team to support the work of the Team in fighting Ebola in the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then last Saturday the LP strongman was in Nimba County where he and the former Superintendent of Nimba County, Edith Gongloe Weh, presented PPE to Dr. Albert Willicor, Chief Medical Officer, United Methodist Hospital, Ganta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation, Cllr. Brumskine told Dr. Willicor that the fight against the Ebola virus begins with the medical professionals who are at the frontline in the national effort to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is why all of our medical practitioners and health workers need to be protected with personal protective equipment,&quot; he said. Cllr. Brumskine and Hon. Gongloe Weh also presented a consignment of rice to be distributed to quarantined families in Nimba, along with other materials to be used in containing the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumskine's message to the people of Bong and Nimba counties was uniform: everyone with whom you interact must be presumed Ebola infected. He said his presence in the counties which have produced reasonably high numbers of virus-infected persons meant that no matter the situation, he cannot shy away from coming to visit his fellow countrymen and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until the Ebola virus is eradicated from our country, we will have to do away with certain cultural habits, such as handshaking, hugging, kissing, and so forth,&quot; he told citizens in Bong and Nimba Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are an intimate and caring people, but we have to now stop providing home healthcare for the sick, even if is a close relative, and have the health professionals take care of those who are ill, regardless of what we think the ailment is. Until the doctors have ruled out Ebola, it has to be hand off. No touching, not even your spouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Liberty Party Bong County Senatorial Candidate Franklin Siakor has provided US$500 to Community Radio Stations in Gbarnga as part of efforts to intensify awareness and outreach activities in Bong County. The stations include Radio Gbarnga and Super Bongese Radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Siakor told The Analyst that the donation was to complement the efforts of the stations in reaching remote villages in the county to provide the opportunity for the voiceless to make inputs in the midst of the rapid spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberty Party Bong County Senatorial Candidate also noted that the gesture is to also be used to improve the station's programming. Mr. Siakor recommended that portion of the money be used be used to purchase digital recorders for the Language Programs at the two stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commanded the Management of the Radio Gbarnga and Super Bongese for the role they continue to play in the fight against Ebola by creating the platform for medical practitioners, civil society actors and community people in the county to create awareness about the danger of the Ebola virus disease and preventative measures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">628 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Ebola virus refuses to be contained and continues to claim the lives of many more Liberians, it would not be because the international community has failed to help Liberia overcome it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is particularly true for Liberia's traditional friends, chiefly the United States of America, which, for its part, reportedly made an intervention as early as March this year when the deadly Ebola was first announced creeping on the population of neighboring Guinea. Again, the US has expanded its assistance in the wake of predictions that the fight against the deadly virus would be long and costly. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States says it is committing more than $100 million to combat Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa since the outbreak was first reported in March 2014, and has expanded its efforts and increased personnel in response to the growing severity of the health emergency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement delivered by the US Ambassador to Liberia last Thursday at a public forum, the United States announced it has already deployed than 100 specialists working in Ebola-affected countries, including a 26-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and more than 70 disease-control experts from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2014, the US ambassador said, U.S. laboratory experts upgraded the testing laboratory at the Liberia Institute for Biological Research (LIBR) so that it could test for Ebola, which was not done in Liberia at the time. Since then, their work has helped to more than double LIBR's testing capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CDC, in partnership with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, established the second Ebola-testing laboratory in Liberia. The mobile testing laboratory, placed at the ELWA campus, shortened the response time of tests for patients at the largest facility currently in Liberia,&quot; Ambassador Deborah Malac announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that, &quot;Since August 23, the U.S. Government, through DART, has airlifted more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia, including 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE), 5,000 body bags, 2 water treatment units, 2 portable water tanks, capable of storing 10,000liters each, 500 infrared thermometers to bolster Ebola Screening efforts, and 100 rolls of plastic sheeting for construction of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to bringing in supplies from outside the region, DART has purchased basic supplies locally, including 50,000 pieces of soap, 400 mattresses, 5,200 gallons of chlorine, and 2,500 buckets, she said, noting, &quot;USAID has provided the World Health Organization with 105,000 sets of PPE for healthcare staff and outbreak investigators in Ebola-affected countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other assistance from the US, she said, include, a charter flight, funded by the U.S. Government and UNICEF that brought more than 40 tons of chlorine and 400-thousand pairs of medical gloves into Monrovia; supporting the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS), which is operating flights in and out of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the United States by providing $10 million to support the African Union deployment of 100 health workers to West Africa. Ambassador Malac said the U.S. Government is working to expand the pipeline of medical equipment and supplies flowing into Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In coming weeks, the DART will airlift 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure the health care workers have the supplies they need to safely do their jobs, she said, stating further that USAID has also funded grants to conduct social mobilization campaigns, expand treatment units and to support the safe removal of the bodies of Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Ref. - We Think You Must Attend [column]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">825 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All indications are that you will not be attending the United Nations General Assembly this year, and that you have turned over to some Government delegation the role ascribed to you as head of state to appear before the world body to give the state of the nation. The other day, it was the Minister of Defense who addressed the Security Council of the United Nations. In the next couple of days, it would be one Liberian or the other that would take of podium to act in your stead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand, and somewhat acknowledge, that you are not making the trip and would not be seen and heard at the United Nations as expected because you intend to be on the ground here with Liberians to provide leadership, inspiration and confidence as the fight against the virulent Ebola virus rages. Perhaps you think, and we somewhat acknowledge, that it is more honorable, substantive and worthy staying on the ground to back up efforts and rally fighting forces repel Ebola, to comfort victims' families and to keep a semblance of normalcy than to embark on a talking shop tour. Or perhaps you think, and may be advised, that nothing you may say or do in New York that your principle deputies cannot say or do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the justification for staying on the home front to mother the fight against Ebola sounds good, we think your personal presence in New York for a few days to rally international support for the situation back home is more strategic, rewarding and critical for ultimate victory against the pandemic. We remember when you were often criticized for frequent foreign travels at the onset of your administration, your defense as amplified by supporters was that the magic wand for Liberia's recovery and development lied outside of the country since we lacked the resources and expertise, and in fact the recognition and respect of the international community, due to a protracted civil conflict. And it was said that no other member of your administration--and no other Liberian for that matter--had the charisma and acumen to charm the then highly suspicious international community and to bring home the badly need goodies. And, to some convincing degree, you proved yourself an indisputable maestro of diplomacy, well articulate and well respected. A lot of the goodies came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Madam President, let us ask: When does a child destined to be great prove its worth to parents and the nation? Or what is the best time a true mother proves her parenthood? When does a warrior show his trait and powers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For us, if there was any time in your life, and in the history of Liberia, you needed to manifest your inborn powers as an Iron Lady, an international whiz, an acclaimed lobbyist and fundraiser, the time is now. While it is true that Ebola's temporary triumph over Liberia is due to the fact that it's the country's first experience and also due to pervasive denial and distrust, we believe the major reason is the lack of capacity--both human and material capacities--to respond quickly and decisively. And we also have no doubt that the worst scenario predictions could come true or be thwarted depending on how much is done to address this resource capacity problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, Your Excellency, the upcoming General Assembly of the United Nations presents the perfect platform for Liberia, particularly for you as the head of state, to get over the resource capacity problem. The time has come to, as you are well known for doing, make the global community rally around Liberia in this great time of need. You know the key international partners very well than any of your lieutenants do, and the international partners do have explicit confidence and deeper respect for you than they do for any of your lieutenants, and would therefore listen and feel moved to act swiftly to our emergency crisis where you to appear before them in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As anyone would note, Madam President, the scourge and trail of the Ebola virus is no different from an armed incursion. Like a military insurrection, Ebola kills. It maims. It makes orphans, widows and paupers. It ruins the national economy and renders the nation vulnerable to intermittent instability. So, let us ask again: If fatalities and upheaval caused by Ebola had come from an armed incursion, wouldn't you be in haste to run to the international community to rescue? Certainly, this pandemic has overwhelmed your administration. It has put to risk everything and everyone you preside over as head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimate solution lies in a global response and you are well suited to drum up that response. Other leaders from countries similarly plagued by Ebola will be making their various cases; they will be competing for the ears and hands of the economic powers meeting at the 69th General Assembly of the United States. Liberia cannot afford to lose the grand opportunity in these critical times. We trust you can do better. You need to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for listening to voice of reason.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In respond to devastations the Ebola virus has unleashed on Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and other West African countries, several African nations have closed their borders. At the onset of the Ebola advent in Liberia, Ghanaians reportedly picked up bulldozers to demolish a refugee camp where Liberians resided for over 20 years and chased them out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This rather unfriendly response, which pundits describe as un-African and inhumane, has triggered outrage amongst the affected countries, sparking diplomatic talks around the Continent to lift the African quarantine. Reports of the arrival in the country today of President John Dramani Mahama of Ghana to show &quot;solidarity&quot; appear to point to a breakthrough into the diplomatic complications or a commencement of damage control measures by some African countries. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian President and the ECOWAS current Chairman John Dramani Mahama will pay an official visit to Liberia today Monday, September 15, 2014. While in Liberia, the Ghanaian Leader will make a donation of assorted food items to aid Liberia's fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Foreign Ministry release, the visit by the Ghanaian leader will also be a show of solidarity with the people of Ghana to Liberia as the country goes through this difficult period. The release said President Mahama will also meet President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for a brief bilateral discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military aircraft carrying the food items arrived in Liberia on Saturday at the Roberts International airport. The Ghanaian Leader is expected to also pay similar visits to neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea which are also hard hit by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bong County superintendent Madam Selena P. Mappy has warned international aid partners without defined objectives of operation in the county to account for their operations in Bong or leave. The deadly Ebola outbreak has attracted huge attention of the international community for quick intervention as it becomes a matter of global threat and concern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the World Health Organization, Medicine San Frontier, USAID, Samaritan Purse and others have been engaged in the country intervening to bring the spread of the disease under control. But Bong County Superintendent Mappy said some aid agencies have been operating in her county with some degree of insincerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a large audience during the dedication ceremony of the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit erected by the Medcine San Frontiers (MSF) recently, Supt. Mappy noted that many aid partners are operating in the county without a defined goal or objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asserted that aid partners are carrying out operations without reference to local authorities, adding that whatever aid that is being provided by these partners, be it financial or logistical, is not accounted for and not done with the consent with the county authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she did not name a particular aid agency in Bong that her office is not officially aware of, she is not withstanding expressed believe that aid agencies should know that it is the locals that should set priorities for areas of their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me be clear about this, to you our partners, you either tell us what you came here to do or leave. I am saying this because most of you come here to eat the same money you are claiming to be providing to assist the county without achieving anything,&quot; she said. She warned further, &quot;So you either tell us what you have or don't get involved. We don't want people operating here under false pretense,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supt. Mappy who was praised for her efforts in ensuring the erection of the treatment unit, lauded the efforts of MSF, citing the enviable and the major role they continue to play in helping to eradicate the deadly Ebola virus not only in the county, but in the country at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She expressed confidence that with the erection of the treatment unit, the rate of Ebola cases will reduce in the county since, according to her, they have somewhere to admit, observe and treat suspected and confirmed cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superintendent called for concerted efforts in dealing with the spread of the virus, while cautioning the Bong Legislative Caucus to do away with politics and unite in the fight against Ebola as there is no time for political bickering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1035 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conglomeration of accredited grassroots youth-led development organizations as well as community volunteers has galvanized efforts to combat the widespread and unprecedented Ebola virus disease in Liberia in partnership with families, schools, communities, faith-based organizations, nongovernmental institutions, businesses, and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This joint initiative, which is named and styled National Youth Action Against Ebola (NYAA-EVD) focuses on community mobilization, capacity building, policy advocacy, awareness and sensitivity, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) education, tracking the implementation of the Liberian government National Action Plan and its Operational Plan for Accelerated Response to Re-occurrence of Ebola Epidemic as it relates to highlighting transparency and accountability issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYAA-EVD has also designed a strategic plan to assist the government and other international partners in carrying out training, public education and contact-tracing as well as explaining in simple terms what it means to be isolated, quarantined, suspected, probable, and confirmed as it pertains to the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launched on August 22 at the Friends of Friends Hatai Association Headquarters in Monrovia, the NYAA-EVD engages, education, and empowers a new generation of tolerant and critical thinkers of passionate volunteers. NYAA-EVD has been able to mobilize, focus person in 12 counties in Liberia to join the fight against the deadly Ebola virus that has engulfed Liberia since March of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYAA-EVD creates a platform that incorporates every registered nonprofit youth-led organization alongside people of all ages and gender through a mutual voluntary partnership agreement designed to involve people and fast-track progress. The youth-led movement also strives to enlighten and broaden the minds of people within Liberia to understand basic facts about Ebola as it relates to signs and symptoms, diagnosis, prevention and control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Karyor, one of the co-founders of NYAA-EVD, who spearheads Mobilization, Program &amp; Outreach activities asserted that the ultimate goal of this youth-led anti-Ebola organization is primarily geared towards motivating and mobilizing young people to get involved in the fight against Ebola through engaging, educating and empowering people of all ages and gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Living in the hardest-hit country which already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths with an exponential increase of new cases in a very short span of time; the young people who constitute over 60 percent of the population are not only at high risk, but need to be involved in the decision making process and empowered to take action in their communities without any unnecessary bureaucracy&quot; the staunch youth anti-Ebola campaigner noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karyor who is also the Executive Director of Consolidated Youth for Peace and Development recounted that since the pronouncement from the Liberian leader encouraging all citizens to join the fight in kicking Ebola out of Liberia; many young people across the country have been eager to get involved, but don't know how and what their responsibilities are in such medical crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passionate anti-Ebola campaigner indicated: &quot;NYAA-EVD was established to bridge the gap in bringing young people on board, harnessing their talents, and creating an enabling environment for young people to be involved, inspired and informed in eradicating the deadliest Ebola outbreak the world has ever known.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coordinator for Mobilization, Program &amp; Outreach pointed out that NYAA-EVD has initiated three training workshops and awareness in the Police Academy community, Swagger Island and ClaraTown community, where the youth-led anti-Ebola organization trained 210 community volunteers. The youth movement has also carried out two media outreach activities on Radio VERITAS and Truth FM with status updates from Bomi, Margibi, Nimba and Grand Cape Mount respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing all we can, utilizing our ideas and scarce resources without any financial or material support from any source. Consequently, I would like to plead for urgent support from embassies accredited near Monrovia, local and international nonprofit organizations, and the government and people of Liberia&quot; the youth leader requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen B. Lavalah, a Cuttington University trained public health practitioner who heads NYAA-EVD disclosed that the outbreak of the world's deadliest Ebola virus disease has drifted in another direction to spin out of control in an already shaky health system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have got a broken public health system with a very minute portion of our national budget allocated for preventive medicine and epidemiological research. As a result, our country has become the hardest-hit, with many more new cases expected due to dilapidated medical infrastructures, poor public transport system, lack of training, insufficient logistics, limited number of health practitioners coupled with structural and governance problems&quot; the National Coordinator of NYAA-EVD emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavalah admonished the government to adhere to its Operational Plan for Accelerated Response to Re-occurrence of the Ebola Epidemic in order to rebuild public trust and implement effective measures to weed out corruption and ensure revenue generated from the Ebola Trust Fund should to be utilized to reach the needy population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Coordinator of NYAA-EVD who is also the Executive Director of Youth Exploring Solutions, a leading grassroots youth-led development organization, registered one of NYAA-EVD's strategic plan of actions is to develop a report under the caption &quot;Beyond Ebola: The Role to Prosperity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The proposed report will proffer smart recommendations that would assist in rebuilding the health sector, boosting investment in agricultural production, exposing transparency and accountability, thereby strengthening public trust, and advancing way forward to prevent further infection and another outbreak of the Ebola virus disease&quot; the youth leader explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYAA-EVD plans to carry out additional workshops in the upcoming week in Nickley Town, Virginia City and other communities across Montserrado County as well as many locations in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Resident Bishop of the Mission of Today Church in Liberia, Bishop P. Manneseh Conto, has disclosed that the cases of Ebola in District #16 and its environs have been reduced since the establishment of the District Taskforce.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to members of the press at his office in New Kru town, the Bishop who is also a key member on the District Anti-Ebola Taskforce revealed that the deadly Ebola viral disease (EVD) is being kicked out of the district gradually due to what he termed as &quot;total collaboration and cooperation of the citizens&quot; with the task force and the continuous awareness and sensitization campaigns launched by the friends of Bishop Conto (FOBC) and the youth of the borough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bishop Conto, campaign efforts by the FOBC and the borough youth have ensured that every household get the preventive messages available to the public. The Bishop said his actions and coordinated actions by actors in the district were yielding greater results that he observed has amounted to the conclusion that the cases of infection in the district were reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that to see the Ebola virus out the district, he and others have made donations of anti-Ebola material, including donation of a vehicle by him to aid in the transportation of patients to various treatment centers in and around the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for the establishment of call centers around the country to ensure easy access to the response mechanism to cases of Ebola in the country, saying such call centers should be established in every district to ensure that victims are quickly taken away from their homes so that other family members will not encounter the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola, it is said is transmitted through person-to-person contact, especially through contact with the body fluid of infected sick person. However, hygienic measures have been suggested by health authorities in the country which include the constant washing of hands with chlorinated water and soap, the staying away from crowded areas and the avoidance of handshaking amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this, Bishop Conto beseeched residents to abide by all of the preventive measures announced so as to ensure containment of the Ebola viral disease. The Man of God called on the government to ensure that the life of every health worker in the country is secured so that the front liners in the Ebola fight will be encouraged in mass to work against the prevalence of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wesleyan Church of Liberia has established an Ebola education and resource center in the 72nd Community in Paynesville, Montserrado County. Speaking Friday at the dedication of the center, Rev. P. FahnKollie, Sr., disclosed that the Center is to ensure that residents of the community are sensitized and prevented from the deadly virus in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senior Pastor of the Wesleyan Church further disclosed that the center was built to increase access to Ebola education, reduce the rate of ignorance and denial among people about the existence of the virus and basic resources for vulnerable people in Paynesville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Wesleyan Church has made available two water tanks each having the storage capacity of 500 gallons of well chlorinated mixed water with other solutions good enough to fight against the survival of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PastorKollie revealed that they are doing everything possible to secure their community from the deadly virus. According to him, the government needs to tackle every corner in the country that is affected with the disease to ensure that the virus is eradicated from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clergyman said the church's initial contribution to the fight against the Ebola virus was the donation of buckets and other preventive materials to the Wesleyan churches in Liberia, making them to know about the existence of Ebola in the country. Pastor Kollie also disclosed that many Liberians are abiding by the necessary preventive measures against the deadly disease to save them from contracting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the government to respond to emergency calls and pick up the sick patients and dead bodies in order to save other people from contracting the virus from relatives, friends and family members. &quot;The government needs to use the funeral workers to respond to death cases and burial purposes instead of training new people who are not knowledgeable of how to deal with dead persons,&quot; the Pastorsuggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, KpetermeniMeinu, a survival of the deadly Ebola viral disease testified the reality and existence of the virus in the country. He said Liberians should stop denying the fact that Ebola is real and is in Liberia; instead he advised residents to follow all of the preventive measures against the virus to curtail its further spread in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 62-year-old traditional oldman,SingbehDuwah, has told Journalists that he has buried twenty-one suspected Ebola bodies in the village of Balakerthela one of the quarantined communities in Bong County. The oldman told a team of reporters visiting Balakerthela recently that he embarked on the burial of the suspected Ebola bodies without the recommended personal protective equipment (PPEs) being used by health workers to conduct the disposed of Ebola suspected bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balakerthela is located in Konoyea Clan in Salala District; and according to the Bong County Health Team, the town has recorded thirty two suspected and confirm Ebola death since the outbreak in Bong County. On the basis of the severity of the Ebola attack on the town, the County Health Team in August quarantined the town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the Journalists in Balakerthela Saturday, OldmanDuwah attributed his intervention to bury suspected Ebola bodies to the failure by the Bong County Ebola Burial Team to remove Ebola bodies from the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bong County Health Team however, recently admitted to our Bong correspondent that the county has a single vehicle to pick up bodies. Our Correspondent also gathered that despite the severity of the Ebola situation in Bong, the County with a population of over three hundred thousand population has a single Ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometime in a day's time, there were about three to four dead bodies in the village and the corpses will be disposed in the village for three days waiting for the burial team to come,&quot; the 62-year-old man explained, saying, the longer you keep the dead bodies, the rapid the disease spread according to health workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditional old man intoned that he mobilized two of his colleagues to carry on the burial of the suspected Ebola bodies on their own due to the obscure absence of the County's Burial Team. &quot;If you called the Burial Team to come and take away the corpses, they will sometimes drag for two or three days and we will not sit and see the bodies to decompose to contaminate the rest of the people&quot; old man Singbeh declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When quizzed what precisely he used to conduct the burial in the absence of the world standard personal protective equipment, the traditional old man narrated that he applied traditional herbs on the corpses including him and his colleagues before carrying on the interment. The herbs that I have, if I used it on the dead body, it will not smell horribly for a week, Olman Duwah disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The townspeople only help with the digging of the grave, but we the ones descend the bodies in the grave&quot; the 62 years old man boasted, slapping his chest with his right hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He informed this reporter that he has been in the business for the past thirty years, but was swift to dejectedly tell this paper that one of his helpers whose identity was not established just passed a week ago. He was not aware that his colleague died pf the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The street corner debate centered around the authority used by him to bury suspected Ebola body without the required PPEs with others saying the old man is immune to the virus, while others are yet saying that the oldman is working along with the spirit of the dark world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the old man was not immune to the virus, while his colleague who has been helping him to carry on the burial falls prey to the virus&quot; Joseph S. Kollie a health practitioner asked. Whatever may be the case, the analyst observed that Oldman Duwah has embarked on a risky task and should be observed by health authorities. The oldman is right to act if the proper medical and burial people are dragging their feet to collect the dead, another analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, our Bong County Correspondent also established that some residents of Balakerthela have left the village for refuge in other satellite villages for fear of contracting the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">956 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Youth Exploring Solutions (YES), a passionate, voluntary and an accredited nonprofit, grassroots youth-led development organization has organized a one-day intensive workshop geared towards training people of all ages on the gender perspective of the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anti-Ebola Gender Awareness Training is an integral part of the Youth Exploring Solutions strategic plan designed to engage, educate, and empower people at the grassroots level to tackle the widespread of Ebola virus disease in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the training, men and women acquired knowledge on problems affecting women, propose possible remedies, and figure out realistic opportunities in the midst of the prevailing medical crisis. It brings into the limelight analysis of the various signs and symptoms, methods of diagnosis, prevention and control of the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the training highlights the plight of women in an epidemic and inspires men to join women to overcome barriers in adopting preventive measures against the world's deadliest Ebola outbreak. It also creates an enabling environment and platform to enhance exchange ideas in order to proffer best alternatives to safeguarding women at the front line in this medical crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training which took place on Friday, September 12, was organized at the New Jerusalem Assembly of God School along the Somalia Drive in Gardnerville Township. It brought together 50 participants from different religion, social status, and community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during the event, Ms. Laura Tragbeh who is a volunteer and soon-to-be an Associate Program Officer of YES lamented a shocking statistic from the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare, which indicates 75 percent of the death toll from the Ebola virus disease constitutes female.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very disheartening, disappointing, and disgusting to see a high proportion of those who died of Ebola in Liberia are female&quot; Ms. Tragbeh stated in a wailing voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Tragbeh continues: &quot;We can no longer afford to reluctantly stand and see our mothers and sisters, aunties and nieces, including our daughters increasingly dying of Ebola without taking any further action. Now is the time for us to wake up, shake up and stand up for female in Liberia to get the acquired information on Ebola and all necessary supports needed to stay living in the midst of an epidemic that have engulfed almost the entire country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young leader urged women and men to work together in finding amicable solutions to addressing the increase death rate among female as a result of the Ebola outbreak. She is at the same time calling on the government, humanitarian organizations, and benevolent individuals to assist Youth Exploring Solutions initiatives through partnership or donation, so as to decentralize the organization's activities to other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We exist to complement government's efforts and not to perpetual criticize or sing everlasting praise. Moreover, we believe nongovernmental institutions are our partners and not competitors. Hence, we are willing, ready and prepared to work together in making our community, nation and world a better place&quot; Ms. Tragbeh noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Pauline W. Nagbe, Gender Coordinator of YES, pointed out that women are caring, sharing and loving and all too often they are in the front line taking care of family needs and providing services that require direct contact with the public, which in most cases make them vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gender Coordinator indicated that economic constraint among women and their involvement in cross border trade, internally commuting between markets, and regularly clustering at various market places served as a conduit to explore women to become at high risk of contracting the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many women are responsible for the survival of most households in Liberia, they are responsible for school fees, medical bills, daily meals, children's clothing and house rents among other basic needs, consequently several market women are too busy in search of scarce resources and every so often many do not even have time to be informed and educated about the Ebola virus disease.&quot; Ms. Nagbe added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Mr. Prince T. Nyumah, a volunteer of YES who presented on the topic: 'Community Engagement Technique &amp; Data Collection' admonished the participants to adhere to all preventive measures approved by the government of Liberia including the World Health Organization and the U.S. based Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Nyumah has urged participants of the workshop to practice lessons acquired and spread knowledge obtained to their families, friends, households and communities so as to inform, involve and inspire more people to work hard in kicking Ebola out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The founder &amp; executive director of YES, Stephen B. Lavalah spoke on 'Understanding the Ebola Virus Disease'. He explained the origin of the Ebola virus disease, ways in which it can be contracted, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, including control and prevention measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lavalah who is a Liberian trained public health practitioner explicated that the Ebola virus disease is primarily contracted through bodily fluid like secretion, saliva, semen, and blood. The founder &amp; executive director clarified in simple terms the meaning of isolation, quarantine, suspected, probable, and confirmed in the context of the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youth leader is urging the government and its international partners to harness local professionals in the fight against Ebola. He is cautioning the government to support youth-led development organizations and utilize community-based approach in ensuring public education and training opportunities for many Liberians who want to volunteer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">902 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's health emergency has really hit hopeless proportion; at least that is exactly what the tune of President Sirleaf's letter to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama conveys. &quot;I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us,&quot; said Iron Lady and head of state Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to head of state Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it is not clear what Obama's response would be, having already reportedly promised a team of US military personnel to Liberia to construct a containment center and having committed a hundred million dollars to the fight against Ebola, the Liberian head of state sounds doleful in the communication to Mr. Obama. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no debate now over who is winning the fight--Government and the deadly Ebola virus. It has come from the horse's own mouth, from Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Commander in Chief and head of state of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our already limited resources have been stretched to breaking point and up to now only a private charity, Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF), has responded robustly in all the affected countries. But they too have reached their limits. Without more direct help from your government, we will lose this battle against Ebola. A WHO investigation conducted with other partners and our own Ministry of Health and Social Welfare projects thousands of cases over the next three weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the words of President Sirleaf in a September 11 letter to President Barack Obama of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First expressing Liberia's gratitude to the US president for the support he has provided the Mano River Union in the battle against the Ebola Virus Disease, President Sirleaf said to Mr. Obama:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The virus is spreading at an exponential rate and we have a limited time window to arrest it. Mr. President, well over 40% of total cases occurred in the last 18 days. Our message has gotten out and our citizens are self-reporting or bringing in their relatives. But our treatment centers are overwhelmed. MSF is now running a 160 bed-unit that will expand even further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us,&quot; she admits definitely. &quot;With blanket travel bans, border closures and interdictions on vessels berthing at our ports, this has become more than a humanitarian emergency in a country that has barely emerged from a 30-year period of civil and political unrest, with the presence of a large youthful (mainly unemployed) population, some of whom were child soldiers - this health emergency threatens civil order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;We need to provide up to 1500 beds in Ebola Treatment Units in Monrovia. We also need to create 10 additional sites in the outlying affected counties. This is beyond anything we are able to address on our own. Unless we significantly increase our capacity to isolate infected persons - their families and communities remain vulnerable and the transmission chain remains unbroken. With our own resources, we can only support and manage one (1) one-hundred bed treatment facility. Medecins Sans Frontiers will scale up to 400 beds, leaving a very significant gap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has been a steadfast friend and a partner, the President told President Obama about the US' roles in Liberia's history. &quot;As impressive as our gains have been, they remain fragile and this outbreak now threatens to undermine those gains and reverse our progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding specific assistance Madam Sirleaf craves for are the following which she unveiled to Mr. Obama: That the US government sets up and operates at least one Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Monrovia. Mr. President at the current rate of infections, only governments like yours have the resources and assets to deploy at the pace required to arrest the spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branches of your military and civilian institutions already have the expertise in dealing with biohazards, infectious diseases and chemical agents. They already understand appropriate infection control protocols and we saw these assets were deployed in Aceh after the tsunami and in Haiti after the earthquake. It is in appreciation of the difference in kind of disaster, that we requesting assistance from units with expertise in managing biohazards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the US government assists in restoring regular basic and secondary health services at least 10 non-Ebola hospitals. We have been told by healthcare workers on the frontline that only 80% of patients presenting symptoms at ETUs are infected with the virus. The other 20% need to be treated at non-Ebola health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we need appropriate infection control protocols and testing facilities to protect health care workers and non-Ebola patients in these facilities. Currently, in Monrovia there are 8 hospitals, ranging from 50 to 418 beds. Across the rest of the country we need to reopen at least one large public health facility to prevent deaths from treatable diseases and prevent maternal and infant mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintenance of air bridges during the course of the response. With airlines servicing the country down to two from a pre-Ebola total of 11, movement of personnel with expertise and equipment into the country is becoming increasingly difficult. Until private air service returns, we will require assistance with air bridges to respond to the crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Herv&eacute;Ladsous has assured President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf that the United Nations remains on the side of Liberia in the wake of the Ebola epidemic and is prepared to support ongoing international efforts led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated that the Organization has taken the initiative to mobilize the entire UN system and beyond to effectively respond to the outbreak with the aim of containing the further spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease in the sub-region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Currently, the United Nations Secretary General, Mr, Ban Ki-moon, has taken advantage of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly to engage different levels of world leaders and is committed to doing all he can do to stop the epidemic,&quot; adding further that the UN is also affected by the outbreak due to the presence of UN peacekeepers on mission here,&quot; Mr. Ladsous noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the UN Under-Secretary General made the assertion when he met with the Liberian leader at her Foreign Ministry office recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ladsous conveyed the deep feelings of Mr. Ban about the current Ebola epidemic in Liberia and other countries in the sub-region. &quot;My visit to Liberia is also to express the solidarity of the Secretary-General and to assure President Sirleaf of the UN system's commitment to help mitigate the risk placed on the hard won gains made in Liberia so far. I am here sitting with you and the Government on how we can more effectively help the situation,&quot; Mr. Ladsous said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated that there is a general agreement that the outbreak is a threat to peace and security in the sub-region and therefore noted that the current mandate of the UN Mission in Liberia may not change because this is not the appropriate time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, President Sirleaf thanked the UN Under-Secretary-General for his visit to Liberia and recounted previous visits, including that of the UN Systems Coordinator on Ebola, David Nabarro and others to help respond to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader described the Ebola virus disease as an unknown enemy in the Liberian setting, making it critical to the response efforts. &quot;Our collective response is yet to catch up with the acceleration rate of the virus thus far, but concrete efforts in strategic partnership with the international community and international responders are now in place to mitigate the situation,&quot; President Sirleaf pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf briefed Mr. Ladsous about several initial measures taken by the Government, including the closure of schools, entertainment centers, video club, etc. and noted that cultural and traditional practices also remain at the heart of efforts to break the transmission of the disease. She, however, expressed hope that the end will come soon as there are so many success stories associated with the release of more survivors from the treatment centers across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our regular health care system was hard hit by the outbreak and needs support and attention to be able to respond to the growing number of non-Ebola cases that are also added to the death rate in the country. We are working with our partners to fully restore regular health care, and the UN's involvement is encouraged,&quot; President Sirleaf urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf pointed out that the Ebola outbreak is having serious consequences on the country's economy, and assured that the government is working with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others to mitigate the situation now and the post-Ebola period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed Mr. Ladsous that the security situation in the country so far remains calm. She pointed out that the desire of training more personnel in the security sector, particularly the police was on course but now restrained by the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the special program held in their honor at the Chevron Monrovia Central Park, Mayor Mvogo thanked the students for &quot;demonstrating a sense of patriotism through voluntarism&quot;. She said &quot;It is unprecedented to see university students voluntarily rendering free service to a national cause, and I urged you to continue doing so&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor noted that the Monrovia City Corporation has constructed 3 Ebola information and sanitation kiosks with the support of the President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the Ebola Task Force. The kiosks are located on McDonald Street, Rally Time Market and the Vai Town at the junction between the two bridges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor said an additional 4 kioks are under construction; &quot;when completed, they will also be placed in other communities around Monrovia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the university volunteers were hired to manage the kiosks. They usually go out into the community where the kiosks are located with megaphones informing the public of the symptoms of Ebola, preventative methods and how to report suspected cases and dead bodies in their respective locations. Each kiosk has free chlorinated soap water for public use and for residents to take home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the honorees, representative of the student leadership of the University of Liberia thanked Mayor Mvogo for the special recognition given them, and further noted that it was a special day in their lives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been disclosed in Monrovia that the United States (US) Military will build a 25-bedoom hospital in the country to buttress efforts aimed at fighting the Ebola virus. United State Ambassador accredited near Monrovia, Madam Debra Malac, said discussions are ongoing as where the hospital should be built but was certain that it would be constructed in Montserrado County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac addressing the weekly Press Briefing at the Ministry of Information said the unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa is an International Security priority for the U.S. Government and as such they will continue to be engaged in the region to eradicate the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Envoy said, &quot;This is the worst outbreak of this virus in 40 years since it was first discovered. We defeated it and this time we will defeat it again. We will stop Ebola and it will take more work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outlining the U.S. Government's support since the outbreak of the EVD, Ambassador Malac said her government had spent US$100m dollars to combat the disease since March noting that such a support is in the form of kinds, materials and most in technical support from experts coming into the three most affected countries, namely Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Malac stressed that since this is the first devastating outbreak of the EVD, the United States is seriously responding by deploring the needed resources and technocrats to fight the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that already the United States has about 100 experts in West Africa among which are 70 Disease Control Experts, to combat the disease and has equally increased support to affected countries through international humanitarian organizations, Non-governmental Organizations(NGOs) the United Nations system and other experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Diplomat used the occasion to dispel rumors that the United States Embassy near Monrovia has been closed to the public saying, &quot;Our doors are open to the public and we are fully staffed but most especially overstaffed due to the number of experts coming from the U.S. government to help fight the Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac recounted the numerous contributions made thus far by the United States Government to aid West Africa fight the Ebola virus among which include the provision of chlorines, buckets, body bags, Ebola Testing laboratories with one being at the ELWA Ebola Treatment unit, as well as US$100,000 assistance to the Liberia National Police (LNP) for the procurement of equipment and Personal Protective Gears to be used by officers who accompany burial teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also recounted the United States efforts aimed at training health practitioners and noted that a major training process was in the making for the Armed Forces of Liberia and the LNP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the isolation of Ebola affected countries which include Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, by the international Community, Ambassador Malac said the United States is working with countries around the world and not to isolate these countries as isolation is not the answer to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want countries around the world to impose travel ban because we are dealing with the guidelines provide by the World Health Organization (WHO) which does not encourage isolation of these countries. However we encourage screening of travellers and not a travel ban,&quot; Ambassador Malac said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One the out-sourcing of the Ebola fight to other countries or Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) Ambassador Malac said the fight against Ebola is a collective responsive effort that does not belong to a particular country or an NGO. Instead, she noted that it must be a unified coordinated effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the U.S. Diplomat said the United States is awaiting the report of the investigation of the West Point incident which led to the alleged shooting of Shaki Kamara who bled to death and two others who are receiving treatment in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Senatorial aspirant of Grand Kru County, Albert Tugbeh Chie who led the special meeting last weekend at his office in Monrovia, said collectively they should find positive solutions to fighting the Ebola virus that is claiming the lives of many people in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also proffered the conduct of massive awareness in the 12 communities in Grand Kru County to educate the people on preventive measures especially in Ebola-reported communities in Parluken, Forpoh District and said he also heard that many people have lost their lives in that part of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sass town Chief, Joseph Weah, lauded Prof. Chie for recognizing and inviting the citizens of Grand Kru to discuss the current situation that is unfolding in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Weah suggested that some residents from the 12 communities of Grand Kru County and residing in Monrovia and its environs should be trained and must be given materials to carry on the massive awareness which should also include the training of individuals who can speak the languages in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in an effort to fight the Ebola virus, Prof. Chie gave L$100,000 to the residents to kick off the Ebola awareness and at the same time said the Friends of Albert Tugbeh Chie (FOATC) had carried several buckets, cartons of clorax and chlorines as well as other materials to the county for Ebola awareness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children has turned over a 50-bed Ebola Treatment facility in Suakoko, Bong County worth about US$170,000 intended to serve the central region as part of its contribution to the national fight against the spread of the virus in other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of the ETU which is a project solely undertaken by Save the Children according to its acting Country Director, Mercy Gichuhi who turned over the unit, was as a result of a request made to them from the local health team of Bong County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Gichihi said Save the Children believes that the construction of the health facility will go a long way in responding to the health need in that region and that Phebe Hospital focuses more on primary health care and at the same time give confidence to the health workers who will know that they have a place to refer confirmed Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Save the Children's partnership is with the government of Liberia and it is the county health team that will now have another agreement with the International Medical Corps (IMC) to manage the facility while Save the Children will always be there to support when there are gaps in terms of medical support and logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children's acting County Director said the next county of support is Margibi where similar facility will be constructed noting that plans are well advanced to begin in the coming weeks and her message to Liberians is to focus more on controlling the virus and by adhering strictly to the advice of medical practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extending her gratitude to Save the Children, Bong Superintendent, Selena Mappy,called, on her colleagues in government not to politicize the urgency of eradicating the virus from the country. She said political hats need to be put aside so that unity can be forged in fight against the virus adding that they should stop shifting blames and defeat the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also called on the international partners not to use the outbreak of the virus in Liberia to exploit the country because every intervention needs to be brought to the table and collectively the agenda can be discussed as in the case with Save the Children for the betterment of the nation and to ensure that the virus is eradicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the ETU, the County Health Officer of Bong County, Samson Arzoaquoi said Ebola has brought a serious situation in the country coupled with frustration from residents who suggested that Phebe Hospital be converted into a holding center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Arzoaquoi who explained how the request to Save the Children was made said due to the prevailing situation, together with the local government, they found the site but were greeted with threats from the same residents whose protest nearly prevented the construction of the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said attention was attracted from Save the Children who provided resources with no financial input from the County Health Team noting, &quot;We congratulate you Save the Children for you have done for us what we never imagined. This is a dream which we imagined the day it would have ever come through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Ebola clearly showed that Liberia did not have the capacity to respond to any health emergency and its good side is that it attracts people and investors, resources who are now bringing them in to help and reminded the attendants that Bong County is one of the epic enters for Laser fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his appeal is that as the Ebola response is to international partners; their help would not be limited to interventions but to look at the country's capacity so that it does not appear as a brief case intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Regional Officer for Africa of the World Health Organization (WHO), Sir Daniel Kebaco said this is the largest Ebola epidemic seen ever in the world but said it can be overcome. He said with the opening of an Ebola Treatment Unit together, they can bring Ebola under control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In respond to devastations the Ebola virus has unleashed on Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and other West African countries, several African nations have closed their borders. At the onset of the Ebola advent in Liberia, Ghanaians reportedly picked up bulldozers to demolish a refugee camp where Liberians have been residing for over 20 years and chased them out. This rather unfriendly response, which pundits describe as un-African and inhumane, has triggered outrage amongst the affected countries, sparking diplomatic talks around the Continent to lift the African quarantine. Reports of the arrival into the country today of President John Dramani Mahama of Ghana to show &quot;solidarity&quot; appear to point to a breakthrough into the diplomatic complications or a commencement of damage control measures by some African countries. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian President and the ECOWAS current Chairman John Dramani Mahama will pay an official visit to Liberia today Monday, September 15, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Liberia, the Ghanaian Leader will make a donation of assorted food items to aid Liberia's fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Foreign Ministry release, the visit by the Ghanaian leader will also be a show of solidarity by the people of Ghana to Liberia as the country goes through this difficult period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release said President Mahama will also meet President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for a brief bilateral discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military aircraft carrying the food items arrived in Liberia on Saturday at the Roberts International airport.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1579 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embattled by the raging siege and devastation visited upon the people of Liberia by the vicious Ebola virus, the Liberian political administration is berserk, finding rescuers and remedies. But there comes the somewhat good news that the world community is meeting this soon and, no doubt, the issue of Ebola, now declared an international health emergency, may feature prominently for discussion. President Sirleaf is reportedly sending a government delegation to put Liberia's case before the United Nations General Assembly, which means she is not inclined to make the trip in person, desirous to stay on the ground with the beleaguered people. Some say the President's decision is patriotic and motherly but others think it is little too ill-advised. The Analyst explores the debate of whether or not the President must attend the 69th UN General Assembly herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite pockets of criticisms here and there regarding its achievements and modus operandi, the United Nations is widely considered the hope of humanity particularly in terms of remedying the intractable problems of conflict, poverty, illiteracy and disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As this principle organ of the UN meets at its 69th assembly of member states, and despite the fact the world body is preoccupied with its post-MDGs agenda which 2015 deadly is next door, there would be the necessary distractions of discussing Ebola in West Africa which is already declared an international health emergency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries mired by the Ebola virus have since packed their luggage bound for New York where the 69th Assembly of the UN will be taking place. They are possibly armed with all eloquence and exhibits at their disposal in order to prick and attract the attention of the philanthropic groups, countries and peoples to help them fight the deadly Ebola disease being hopelessly fought in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report as at September 7, 2014, the total number of probable, confirmed and suspected cases in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was 4366, with 2218 deaths. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the WHO report has conveyed the gloomiest news from Liberia, which in the past week alone has seen almost 400 confirmed and probable cases reported which almost doubles the number of newly reported cases in the preceding week. Liberia has over half of all fatalities reported in the affected countries. Liberia stands over 2000 cumulative fatalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dire situation Liberia faces, which experts contend is yet to reach its peak, warrants intense foreign shuttles, according to some pundits, to mobilize assistance as it is indicated that the virus' ferocity has outpaced the capacity of the country--of the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is reported that President Sirleaf is not likely making any trip out the country soon, including attending the pending United Nations General Assembly where world powers and philanthropists will be sitting to hear cases from across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reportedly, the President has set up a 20-men delegation to make the trip on her behalf, poised to remain on the ground with the Ebola-stricken population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who support the President's decision say it is patriotic and motherly that she remains on the ground to assure inspiration and confidence in the population which is drowned in trepidations, fear and hopelessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United Nations assemblies are nothing but talking shops,&quot; said Maryann K. Flahn, who identified herself a women rights advocate. &quot;This is not time to talk; it is time for action. Let the Old ma stay here to boost the fight against Ebola. After all the country is represented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Kollie, Jr., Vice President of a community credit club, Wlee-mon-deh, agrees: &quot;What does President Sirleaf have to do at the UN at this time. Is the General Assembly a place to share foreign aid? It is not. Everyone in the world has got the story about Ebola and this doesn't need the President to press for assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one pundit, President Sirleaf's reluctance to attend the 69th UN General Assembly is a show of consistency, as she announced that all officials of her administration must remain in the country to help fight Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president cannot say one thing and do another,&quot; said the pundit who asked not to be named in print. &quot;She is taking actions against those who violated her edict, and it would be inconsistent with the intent and spirit of her edict if she left the country for whatever reason, including attending the General Assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have sharply disagreed, arguing that leaving the country to lobby for urgently needed support and assistance to repel a deadly virus makes more sense than staying on ground for the sake of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does staying on the ground or staying away from the pending UN General Assembly bring to the table in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus,&quot; quipped Robert K. Jebboe, a community watch team leader on the Somalia Drive. &quot;Does it equip health workers in the frontline with the kind of materials, equipment and remunerations needed to fight this fast-spreading disease?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jebboe contends that if the president's presence at the Assembly was not necessary, she shouldn't have named up to 20 delegates to attend which is an apparent move to impress the organizers that Liberia is not taking the meeting lightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most effective remedy to Ebola is a global response, said Jebboe further, adding: &quot;And we have the global community--all the good will people--meeting in New York in days. Is it not time, in fact the most pressing time, for the President to make her presence felt?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our President is on record for attending the General Assembly of the United Nations many times--in times when our country had been in relative peace; when it had not been so plagued by an invisible enemy taking hundreds of lives on the daily basis and with the potential of taking more lives and wrecking all the gains made after the civil conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also commenting on the issue was a local clergyman Emmet O. Hoff who posited that if the argument is made that soliciting international aid to fight Ebola does not necessarily have to be made by President Sirleaf, then it is unfortunate because it downplays and depreciates the President's prided image as a gifted international player and miracle-maker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All we know, or at least are told to believe, is that President Sirleaf is the only Liberian for now that is international popular and walks through the global world in pride and dignity and is able to act quickly Liberian issue,&quot; Rev. Hoff noted. &quot;If that is true, and I have no qualm about it, then it is time for the President to show that juice of hers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He posits further: &quot;Firstly, if it is not important for the President to attend in person, and or if it does not matter who woos international support to fight Ebola, then why did the President telephone President Barack Obama to request assistance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why was she the one at the early days of her administration living practically in the air shuttling from country to country drumming recovery and development support from international community? Or is it to say that the impact of Ebola--the death of over two thousand citizens in the hand of the virus and with estimates that thousands of more Liberians could die--is lesser and insignificant to reasons why she was attending every international meeting abroad?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Commander in Chief of Liberia, and more so as someone who is good or gifted at making the global community listen to Liberian issues, Rev. Hoff said, &quot;it is very necessary for President Sirleaf to leave home and attend the General Assembly meeting; she will definitely attract ample commitment from friends to quickly come and send the badly needed assistance to fight and promptly defeat Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly exercises deliberative, supervisory, financial, and elective functions relating to any matter within the scope of the UN Charter. Its primary role, however, is to discuss issues and make recommendations, though it has no power to enforce its resolutions or compel state action. Other functions include admitting new members; selecting members of the Economic and Social Council, the nonpermanent members of the Security Council, and the Trusteeship Council; supervising the activities of the other UN organs, from which the General Assembly receives reports; and participating in the election of judges to the International Court of Justice and the selection of the secretary-general. Decisions usually are reached by a simple majority vote. On important questions, however--such as the admission of new members, budgetary matters, and peace and security issues--a two-thirds majority is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly convenes annually and in special sessions, electing a new president each year from among five regional groups of states. At the beginning of each regular session, the General Assembly also holds a general debate, in which all members participate and may raise any issue of international concern. Most work, however, is delegated to six main committees, known as (1) Disarmament and International Security, (2) Economic and Financial, (3) Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural, (4) Special Political and Decolonization, (5) Administrative and Budgetary, and (6) Legal. (Committees are generally referred to by their number; thus, the Disarmament and International Security Committee is known as the First Committee.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Ebola virus refuses to be contained and continues to claim the lives of many more Liberians, it would not be because the international community has failed to help Liberia overcome it. This is particularly true for Liberia's traditional friends, chiefly the United States of America which, for its part, reportedly made an intervention as early as March this year when the deadly Ebola was first announced creeping on the population from neighboring Guinea. Again, the US has expanded its assistance in wake of predictions that the fight against the deadly virus would be long and costly. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States says it is committing more than $100 million to combat Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa since the outbreak was first reported in March 2014, and has expanded its efforts and increased personnel in response to the growing severity of the health emergency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement delivered by the US Ambassador to Liberia last Thursday at a public forum, the United States announced it has already deployed than 100 specialists working in Ebola-affected countries, including a 26-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and more than 70 disease-control experts from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2014, the US ambassador said, U.S. laboratory experts upgraded the testing laboratory at the Liberia Institute for Biological Research (LIBR) so that it could test for Ebola, which was not done in Liberia at the time. Since then, their work has helped to more than double LIBR's testing capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;CDC, in partnership with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, established the second Ebola-testing laboratory in Liberia. The mobile testing laboratory, placed at the ELWA campus, shortened the response time of tests for patients at the largest facility currently in Liberia,&quot; Ambassador Deborah Malac announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that, &quot;Since August 23, the U.S. Government, through DART, has airlifted more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia, including 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE), 5,000 body bags, 2 water treatment units, 2 portable water tanks, capable of storing 10,000liters each, 500 infrared thermometers to bolster Ebola Screening efforts, and 100 rolls of plastic sheeting for construction of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to bringing in supplies from outside the region, DART has purchased basic supplies locally, including 50,000 pieces of soap, 400 mattresses, 5,200 gallons of chlorine, and 2,500 buckets, she said, noting, &quot;USAID has provided the World health Organization with 105,000 sets of PPE for healthcare staff and outbreak investigators in Ebola-affected countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other assistance from the US, she said, include, a charter flight, funded by the U.S. Government and UNICEF that brought more than 40 tons of chlorine and 400-thousand pairs of medical gloves into Monrovia; supporting the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS), which is operating flights in and out of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the United States by providing $10 million to support the African Union deployment of 100 health workers to West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac said the U.S. Government is working to expand the pipeline of medical equipment and supplies flowing into Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In coming weeks, the DART will airlift 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) to ensure the health care workers have the supplies they need to safely do their jobs, she said, stating further that USAID has also funded grants to conduct social mobilization campaigns, expand treatment units and to support the safe removal of the bodies of Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emergency relief efforts to contain the deadly Ebola virus, as it was during the civil conflict, have largely been concentrated in Montserrado County, understandably because the casualty figures are high in this urban province of Liberia. But death tolls are also climbing in the countryside and there is evidently little nor no major concentration in terms of external assistance. Charles Walker Brumskine, the political leader of the opposition Liberty Party has discerned the disparity. Over the weekend, he was in Bong and Nimba Counties where he delivered much needed assistance. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the weekend, and following a meeting with President Sirleaf and other opposition political parties where she rallied all Liberians to assist in the fight against Ebola, Liberty Party strongman Charles Walker Brumskine was in Bong and Nimba Counties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He entered Gbarnga, Bong County on Friday, September 12, 2014, along with the county's Senator Franklin Siakor, where they presented several consignments of rice to be distributed to quarantined communities in Gbarnga: Civil Compound and Millionaire Quarters. They also delivered rice to the association of disabled persons in Gbarnga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to The Analyst in Gbarnga, Cllr. Brumskine said that he decided to visit Bong County in order to identify with the people as he has been doing in other counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his presence in Bong as well as Nimba counties, where he visited Saturday, would make a difference in the lives of some of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumskine said if only one life was saved because that one person's trust him and the belief in the need to do things differently, his trip is worth the while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He implored all Liberians to follow the instructions of the medical experts, adding, &quot;We will overcome this national catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard bearer emeritus of the Liberty Party emphasized that every Liberian needed to embark on a personal crusade within the limit of the capacity of their resources to complement government and the international community's efforts to rid Liberia of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselor Brumskine called on Liberians to stop doubting the existence of Ebola in the country and take advantage of preventative measures recommended by the World Health Organization, (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to a cross session of Bong County citizens Friday, September 11, 2014 in Gbarnga, Counselor Brumskine said he was in the County to identify with citizens amidst deadly Ebola virus disease outbreak in the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Bong County Health Team, the virus has killed more sixty persons in the county including health care providers and ordinary citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselor Brumskine said Bong County is centrally located and hosts thousands of Liberians from different parts of the country and therefore called on residents of the county to join efforts in combating the deadly Ebola virus diseases that continues to devastate the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that his visit to the county was the beginning of series of visits he intends to do in Bong County in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of his visit to Bong County, he provided 65 five bags of rice to the Bong County Branch of the Liberty Party for distribution to quarantined quarters in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that the LP strongman on August 16, 2014 provided LD$100,000 to the Bong County Health Team to support the work of the Team in fighting Ebola in the County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then last Saturday the LP strongman was in Nimba County where he and the former Superintendent of Nimba County, Edith Gongloe Weh, presented PPE to Dr. Albert Willicor, Chief Medical Officer, United Methodist Hospital, Ganta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation, Cllr. Brumskine told Dr. Willicor that the fight against the Ebola virus begins with the medical professionals who are at the frontline in the national effort to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is why all of our medical practitioners and health workers need to be protected with personal protective equipment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Brumskine and Hon. Gongloe Weh also presented a consignment of rice to be distributed to quarantined families in Nimba, along with other materials to be used in containing the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brumskine's message to the people of Bong and Nimba counties was uniform: everyone with whom you interact must be presumed Ebola infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his presence in the counties which have produced reasonably high numbers of virus-infected persons meant that no matter the situation, he cannot shy away from coming to visit his fellow countrymen and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until the Ebola virus is eradicated from our country, we will have to do away with certain cultural habits, such as handshaking, hugging, kissing, and so forth,&quot; he told citizens in Bong and Nimba Counties. &quot;We are an intimate and caring people, but we have to now stop providing home healthcare for the sick, even if is a close relative, and have the health professionals take care of those who are ill, regardless of what we think the ailment is. Until the doctors have ruled out Ebola, it has to be hand off. No touching, not even your spouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Liberty Party Bong County Senatorial Candidate Franklin Siakor has provided US$500 to Community Radio Stations in Gbarnga as part of efforts to intensify awareness and outreach activities in Bong County. The stations include Radio Gbarnga and Super Bongese Radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Siakor told The Analyst that the donation was to complement the efforts of the stations in reaching remote villages in the county to provide the opportunity for the voiceless to make inputs in the midst of the rapid spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberty Party Bong County Senatorial Candidate also noted that the gesture is to also be used to improve the station's programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Siakor recommended that portion of the money be used be used to purchase digital recorders for the Language Programs at the two stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commanded the Management of the Radio Gbarnga and Super Bongese for the role they continue to play in the fight against Ebola by creating the platform for medical practitioners, civil society actors and community people in the county to create awareness about the danger of the Ebola virus disease and preventative measures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early fears about the declaration of a state of emergency by Government to contain a vicious pestilence were that it would be used to prey on unsuspecting individuals and groups, particularly dissenting voices that Government has got eyes on for a long time and that it would set loose marauding armed men upon the civilian population. The fears have not proven unwarranted. In less than a month of the declaration, the fears found legitimacy in the cow-boy styled knockdown of the Chronicle Newspaper and the gunning down of an adolescent youth West Point. This has alarmed, though not surprised, members of the Liberian human rights community who understand the traits and behaviors of Liberia's military and police forces and had predict the perversion of the state of emergency. Now another prominent member of the community, Kofi Woods, currently visiting the United States is warning against continued abuse of the state of emergency. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Public Works Minister now Legal Consultant of the Liberia Law Society is warning that the state of emergency in Liberia should not be used by government and its security forces to violate individual and collective rights of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, one of Liberia's renowned human rights lawyers, urges Government not to use the state of emergency imposed professedly to address a health crisis to militarize the country and to restrict press freedom and freedom of speech.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the remarks, according to a dispatch from the United States, while speaking to journalists. Woods used the occasion to condemn the shooting to death of Shaki Kamara, a youth in West Point, by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia, as well as the closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper; terming these actions as overreaching, heavy handed and unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on Government to commission an Independent Inquiry into the circumstances leading to the shooting and killing of Kamara and the bullet wounds suffered by another citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods also called on the government to re-open the Chronicle Newspaper and halt all further intimidation of the Press, including the restriction on the freedom of the Chronicle's publisher to travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods insists that the Independent Inquiry should also examine the constitutionality of the blanketed state of emergency, the use of the security forces during this national health emergency, as well as their deportment and exercise of force. He noted that the work of the independent panel must also consider the future role of security and military personnel in non- military crisis, and the improvement of the psychology and capacity of security forces to deal with matters of civil engagements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights lawyer also strongly criticized the declaration of the state of emergency, noting that it lacks specificities as to its purpose, scope and limitations, as required by the Constitution of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He questioned the constitutionality of the President's declaration of a state of emergency; noting that while Article 86 (a) of the Constitution grants the President the power to declare a state of emergency, Article 86 (b) clearly states that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A state of emergency may be declared only where there is a threat or outbreak of war or where there is civil unrest affecting the existence, security or well-being of the Republic amounting to a clear and present danger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods noted that the best way to deal with the Ebola emergency while at the same time avoiding a constitutional crisis, stigmatizing the country and population and giving security forces the perception that they have the liberty to trample the rights of citizens is to use the Public Health Law, as opposed to the imposition a sweeping constitutional state of emergency with no specific objectives, targets and benchmarks. &quot;How can we impose a national state of emergency, quarantine entire swaths of our population, restrict the movement of our own people, but at the same time criticize other countries and even airlines for imposing similar restrictions on our citizens,? Woods argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods maintained that the Ebola crisis is a national public health emergency that must be dealt with as such but noted that political decisions and considerations continue to dominate real health decisions and programs. In a health emergency we must listen to the health experts and health workers to guide our decisions and actions and revert to other legal/constitutional actions only where the public health law proves inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without any doubt, the Government's policies and actions appear uncoordinated, fragmented and fraught with contradictions. This has led to increased distrust in our national government and lack of national ownership of the on-going fight against the Ebola Virus&quot;, the renowned human rights activist averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods noted that some of the recent policies of government constitute what he terms as &quot;moral sin and ethical transgression against the poor and weak in our society,&quot; emphasizing that government must return to the drawing board to review some of those policy options, in the hope of restoring confidence and re-energizing the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has recommended the review of all policies and parallel actions to address the suffering of the poor. This includes the current restrictions on freedom of movement, health interventions, humanitarian intervention and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a nation and people, now is the time for us to begin to address with urgency, the moral, legal and ethical imperatives to heighten the fight against Ebola, restore the hope of our people, and assure them that this too shall come to pass, Woods, observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamenting the death of Dr. Abraham Borbor whom he referred to as a schoolmate, Atty Woods expressed his condolences to the bereaved family and maintained that the Liberian Government is under obligation to conduct a full-scale medical inquiry on the use of the experimental drug (ZMAPP) and bring to closure any doubt associated with its application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Public Works Minister has made a number of recommendations to Government in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst other thing, Mr. Wood called for a review all actions and the term of reference of the National Task Force and restructure the national framework for policy, action and implementation; prioritizing the needs and demands of health workers and practitioners. Those at the forefront of this fight continue to complain of neglect thus victimizing the foot soldiers and a review and restructure and National Health Team led by the Ministry of Health. Bold decisions need to be taken in the regards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also urged government provide an initial financial update on all income, contributions and expenditures made to the fight against Ebola to date; develop task-sharing pathways assigning unto itself the monitoring and evaluation component of the fight while existing INGOs and their national counterparts including the Liberian Red Cross must be empowered to do the implementation; and that 85% of salaries, allowances and benefits in high brackets (Executive, Legislative and Judiciary) must be sacrificed for three months during the emergency to provide for the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is real sacrifice demonstrate that they too can sacrifice to help rescue our country, the human rights advocate said, adding: &quot;All non-essential civil servants must be retrained and redeployed to assist with the fight against Ebola. The crisis with volunteers won't be occurring if the already paid civil servants are re-deployed and that there should be no negotiations and sale of oil blocks and concessions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development and in support of the appeals made by Dr. Jerry Brown of ELWA, he has donated a laptop through CASE-Liberia and will sending some drugs to assist the treatment center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Sales of the NOVAFONE GSM Corporation, Dr. Rajen George says unless health workers who are at the frontline of fighting Ebola from the country are motivated with the needed logistics and incentives, the fight against the deadly Ebola virus will not yield the desired success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. George indicated that nurses, physicians and doctors are first line of contact with the virus in the fight and should be given the needed attention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against that backdrop, he pointed out that the NOVAFONE family was glad to firstly identify with the healthcare workers at the John F.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy Medical Center for their empowerment through the institution as they embark on the public service of combating the Ebola viral disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the statement Friday when the NOVAFONE Management donated assorted materials to the administration of JFK Medical Center.The donation was made in the compound of JFK Hospital in Monrovia with several senior staffs in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items donated to the hospital include hundreds pieces of mobile phones to be used for group communication of staff members working in the Ebola response system of the JFK, several cartons of toiletries and detergent amongst others including toilet tussles, soaps, chlorides, Dettol, towels and tents to enhance the JKF Memorial Center's fight against the spread and for the containment of the Ebola virus out of Liberia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The materials, Dr. George believed, will help nurses and doctors and other workers at the JFK get more motivated in the service of their nation and its people while fighting against the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said NOVAFONE as Liberia's best GSM provider, has always made it its responsibility to help in providing solution to situations such as containment of outbreak and spread of the Ebola virus, which the government and its partners have engaged to contain, saying that NOVAFONE will always be there to provide needed assistance to the country and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking during the donation, NOVAFONE's Chief Executive Officer Bechir El-Khoury expressed appreciation with the level of efforts being applied by the management of the hospital to preventing the disease from further spreading in both its facilities and in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JKF Hospital under the leadership Dr. Winnie McDonald Scott, the NOVAFONE Boss, said was very effective in the fighting against the virus thereby compelling the NOVAFONE Management assist the institution in its Ebola response efforts to save humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. El-Khoury said the mobile phone company is committed to identifying with the Liberians people, especially with medical institutions, beginning with the JKF Memorial Medical Center as one of the first frontline fighters against the virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the consignment of assorted items, JFK's Chief Administrator, Dr. Winnie McDonald Scott, praised the management of NOVAFONE for the donation, promising that the hospital staff will use the materials wisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Scott said the materials will help the staffs to increase their participation in the fight against the deadly virus in Liberia, noting that the JFK has been contemplating on expanding its facilities as part of its plan of containing the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new facilities the Center is considering to construct on its compound is to serve as a first approach in detecting suspected cases of the Ebola virus, Dr. Scott hinted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the facilities to be constructed will serve as a channel for preventing the spread of the virus and would help the administration to usefully work in the interest of the public and the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She appreciated the management of NOVAFONE and called on the company to continue its support in the general interest of Liberians and Liberia and the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bong County superintendent Madam Selena P. Mappy has warned international aid partners without defined objectives of operation in the county to account for their operations in Bong or leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadly Ebola outbreak has attracted huge attention of the international community for quick intervention as it becomes a matter of global threat and concern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the World Health Organization, Medicine San Frontier, USAID, Samaritan Purse and others have been engaged in the country intervening to bring the spread of the disease under control. But Bong County Superintendent Mappy said some aid agencies have been operating in her county with some degree of insincerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a large audience during the dedication ceremony of the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit erected by the Medcine San Frontiers (MSF) recently, Supt. Mappy noted that many aid partners are operating in the county without a defined goal or objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asserted that aid partners are carrying out operations without reference to local authorities, adding that whatever aid that is being provided by these partners, be it financial or logistical, is not accounted for and not done in consent with the county authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she did not name a particular aid agency in Bong that her office is not officially aware of, she is not withstanding expressed believe that aid agencies should know that it is the locals that should set priorities for areas of their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me be clear about this, to you our partners, you either tell us what you came here to do or leave. I am saying this because most of you come here to eat the same money you are claiming to be providing to assist the county without achieving anything,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned further, &quot;So you either tell us what you have or don't get involve. We don't want people operating here under false pretense,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supt. Mappy who was praised for her efforts in ensuring the erection of the treatment unit, lauded the efforts of MSF, citing the enviable and major role they continue to play in helping to eradicate the deadly Ebola virus not only in the county, but in the country at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She expressed confidence that with the erection of the treatment unit, the rate of Ebola cases will reduce in the county since, according to her, they have somewhere to admit, observe and treat suspected and confirmed cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Superintendent called for concerted efforts in dealing with the spread of the virus, while cautioning the Bong Legislative Caucus to do away with politics and unite in the fight against Ebola as there is no time for political bickering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">900 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's health emergency has really hit hopeless proportion; at least that is exactly what the tune of President Sirleaf's letter to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama conveys. &quot;I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us,&quot; said Iron Lady and head of state Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to head of state Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it is not clear what Obama's response would be, having already reportedly promised a team to US military personnel to Liberia to construct containment center and having committed a hundred million dollars to the fight against Ebola, the Liberian head of state sounds doleful in the communication to Mr. Obama. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no debate now over who is winning the fight--Government and the deadly Ebola virus. It has come from the horse's own mouth, from Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Commander in Chief and head of state of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our already limited resources have been stretched to breaking point and up to now only a private charity, Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF), has responded robustly in all the affected countries. But they too have reached their limits. Without more direct help from your government, we will lose this battle against Ebola. A WHO investigation conducted with other partners and our own Ministry of Health and Social Welfare projects thousands of cases over the next three weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are words of President Sirleaf in a September 11 letter to President Barack Obama of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First expressing Liberia's gratitude to the US president for the support he has provided the Mano River Union in the battle against the Ebola Virus Disease, President Sirleaf said to Mr. Obama: &quot;The virus is spreading at an exponential rate and we have a limited time window to arrest it. Mr. President, well over 40% of total cases occurred in the last 18 days. Our message has gotten out and our citizens are self-reporting or bringing in their relatives. But our treatment centers are overwhelmed. MSF is now running a 160 bed-unit that will expand even further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am being honest with you when I say that at this rate, we will never break the transmission chain and the virus will overwhelm us,&quot; she admits definitely. &quot;With blanket travel bans, border closures and interdictions on vessels berthing at our ports, this has become more than a humanitarian emergency in a country that has barely emerged from a 30-year period of civil and political unrest, with the presence of a large youthful (mainly unemployed) population, some of whom were child soldiers - this health emergency threatens civil order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;We need to provide up to 1500 beds in Ebola Treatment Units in Monrovia. We also need to create 10 additional sites in the outlying affected counties. This is beyond anything we are able to address on our own. Unless we significantly increase our capacity to isolate infected persons - their families and communities remain vulnerable and the transmission chain remains unbroken. With our own resources we can only support and manage one (1) one-hundred bed treatment facility. Medecins Sans Frontiers will scale up to 400 beds, leaving a very significant gap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has been a steadfast friend and a partner, the President told President Obama about the US' roles in Liberia's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As impressive as our gains have been, they remain fragile and this outbreak now threatens to undermine those gains and reverse our progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding specific assistance Madam Sirleaf craves for are the following which she unveiled to Mr. Obama:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the US government sets up and operates at least one Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Monrovia. Mr. President at the current rate of infections, only governments like yours have the resources and assets to deploy at the pace required to arrest the spread. Branches of your military and civilian institutions already have the expertise in dealing with biohazards, infectious diseases and chemical agents. They already understand appropriate infection control protocols and we saw these assets were deployed in Aceh after the tsunami and in Haiti after the earthquake. It is in appreciation of the difference in kind of disaster, that we requesting assistance from units with expertise in managing biohazards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the US government assists in restoring regular basic and secondary health services at least 10 non-Ebola hospitals. We have been told by healthcare workers on the frontline that only 80% of patients presenting symptoms at ETUs are infected with the virus. The other 20% need to be treated at non-Ebola health facilities. However, we need appropriate infection control protocols and testing facilities to protect health care workers and non-Ebola patients in these facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, in Monrovia there are 8 hospitals ranging from 50 to 418 beds. Across the rest of the country we need to reopen at least one large public health facility to prevent deaths from treatable diseases and prevent maternal and infant mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintenance of air bridges during the course of the response. With airlines servicing the country down to two from a pre-Ebola total of 11, movement of personnel with expertise and equipment into the country is becoming increasingly difficult. Until private air service returns, we will require assistance with air bridges to respond to the crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Madam Sirleaf Needs to Show Face At UN [editorial]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">914 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE HAS BEEN quite a hilarious debate amongst pundits of late over whether or not President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf should personally attend the 69th United Nations General Assembly upcoming in New York. While arguments on all sides of the debate sound good, we think the President making the trip in person at this time of national emergency makes more sense. And we would like to see the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; trashing all odds and mustering the courage to face the world at this crucial meeting of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YES, IT IS true that during most part of her presidency, the 24th Liberian head of state has long been criticized and condemned for making too many foreign trips--some say unnecessary trips--not only at the expense of taxpayers but also in disregard to a more demanding domestic agenda. Some critics have catalogued and publicized all President Sirleaf foreign trips and coming to the conclusion that she could enter in the World's Guinness Book of Record as topping all modern presidents in foreign travels. In fact, some have mocked that she was an airplane-freaked leader. Others have said she was obsessed with foreign travels that she was usurping the functions and duties of the Minister or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT IN COUNTERING those apprehensions, the President's supporters have said, and perhaps absolutely rightly, that a post-conflict country like Liberia, which was nearly expunged if not ostracized from the community of nations in an inter-dependent world order, deserved first and foremost nothing less than an urgent, rapid and sustained engagement with the international community. They have contended that Liberia needed first and foremost its lost place at the conference table of the global community and all the social, economic and political goodies from the friends abroad that a war-ruined nation must be nursed with to get back on its own. The President Sirleaf's supporters have also maintained, perhaps absolutely rightly, that her most proven leadership strength as the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; lies solidly in her international persona, repute and charm in international affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF THOSE STRONG counters from supporters and admirers of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf are anything to go by, if those widely exalted traits of hers are truly reflective of her inner powers found expressive in &quot;This Child Will be Great&quot;--something we absolutely have no objection about--then there is no better time to justify supporters and prove critics wrong than now. In other words, there is no better time for President Sirleaf to summon and muster her natural gift and capacity, and to prove potent her magic wand and dexterity in international relations than now at the General Assembly of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE SAY THIS because the nation and the people that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf leads risk annihilation to the invasion of Liberia by an invisible enemy force. Already, in the space of actually two months, nearly two thousand citizens are clawed away by the Ebola virus and its accomplices: other related sicknesses and diseases, and the accompanying social and economic depravities created. And experts are predicting that the tide of fatality hasn't reached its peak: meaning that this invisible enemy, which the whole of modern humanity despite all its advancement has got no solution for, is winning the war and the population faces ultimate decimation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THIS TIME, and in the face of this looming apocalypse, the world community is meeting in New York and the devastation of Ebola and what's needed to be done is certainly high on the agenda. Needless to say to President Sirleaf, a noted international civil servant, that it is at such crucial meetings that beleaguered nations and their woes take center stage and leaders of those countries walk in personally and directly to make their cases for collective international remedy. In the past and even now, the world has seen at this forum even the most despotic regimes alarming about some domestic uprisings against their leaderships and the sovereignties of nations they lead. What about this unprecedented health emergency facing Liberia that has made the entire world to marvel in disbelief and trepidations? As the world meets to hear from first hand from the most affected countries--Liberia being the worst hit--and certainly as the international community will be contemplating how to fathom decisive response measures, isn't it a better time for President Sirleaf to walk in personally and directly, take the podium to do what she's best known and respected for at home and abroad--make the world see clearly the situation at home and to do something quickly? Who else in her Government share that persona and capacity to make the world hear and act?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE WONDER WHAT President Sirleaf would have done if this Ebola invasion were a military insurgency having the same casualties the disease has caused and is further predicted to cause. We think President Sirleaf would have long been in New York prostrating before powerful countries to solicit conceited international intervention on behalf of her Government and people. This is why we don't understand why she would not like to do likewise with Ebola which everyone says is equally deadly and in fact inescapable compared to military uprising. And we believe it is only her representation that would make the desired impact of attracting, and quickly, the kind of international response the crisis at home really deserves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All indications are that you will not be attending the United Nations General Assembly this year, and that you have turned over to some Government delegation the role ascribed to you as head of state to appear before the world body to give the state of the nation. The other day, it was the Minister of Defense who addressed the Security Council of the United Nations. In the next couple of days, it would be one Liberian or the other that would take of podium to act in your stead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand, and somewhat acknowledge, that you are not making the trip and would not be seen and heard at the United Nations as expected because you intend to be on the ground here with Liberians to provide leadership, inspiration and confidence as the fight against the virulent Ebola virus rages. Perhaps you think, and we somewhat acknowledge, that it is more honorable, substantive and worthy staying on the ground to back up efforts and rally fighting forces repel Ebola, to comfort victims' families and to keep a semblance of normalcy than to embark on a talking shop tour. Or perhaps you think, and may be advised, that nothing you may say or do in New York that your principle deputies cannot say or do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the justification for staying on the home front to mother the fight against Ebola sounds good, we think your personal presence in New York for a few days to rally international support for the situation back home is more strategic, rewarding and critical for ultimate victory against the pandemic. We remember when you were often criticized for frequent foreign travels at the onset of your administration, your defense as amplified by supporters was that the magic wand for Liberia's recovery and development lied outside of the country since we lacked the resources and expertise, and in fact the recognition and respect of the international community, due to a protracted civil conflict. And it was said that no other member of your administration--and no other Liberian for that matter--had the charisma and acumen to charm the then highly suspicious international community and to bring home the badly need goodies. And, to some convincing degree, you proved yourself an indisputable maestro of diplomacy, well articulate and well respected. A lot of the goodies came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Madam President, let us ask: When does a child destined to be great prove its worth to parents and nation? Or what is the better time a true mother proves her parenthood? When does a warrior show his trait and powers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For us, if there was any time in your life, and in the history of Liberia, you needed to manifest your inborn powers as an Iron Lady, an international whiz, an acclaimed lobbyist and fundraiser, the time is now. While it is true that Ebola's temporary triumph over Liberia is due to the fact that it's the country's first experience and also due to pervasive denial and distrust, we believe the major reason is the lack of capacity--both human and material capacities--to respond quickly and decisively. And we also have no doubt that the worse scenario predictions could come true or be thwarted depending on how much is done to address this resource capacity problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, Your Excellency, the upcoming General Assembly of the United Nations presents the perfect platform for Liberia, particularly for you as the head of state, to get over the resource capacity problem. The time has come to, as you are well known for doing, make the global community rally around Liberia in this great time of need. You know the key international partners very well than any of your lieutenants do, and the international partners do have explicit confidence and deep respect for you than they do for any of your lieutenants, and would therefore listen and feel moved to act swiftly to our emergency crisis were you to appear before them in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As anyone would note, Madam President, the scourge and trail of the Ebola virus is no different from an armed incursion. Like a military insurrection, Ebola kills. It maims. It makes orphans, widows and paupers. It ruins the national economy and renders the nation vulnerable to intermittent instability. So, let us ask again: If fatalities and upheaval caused by Ebola had come from an armed incursion, wouldn't you be in haste to run to the international community for rescue? Certainly, this pandemic has overwhelmed your administration. It has put to risk everything and everyone you preside over as head of state. The ultimate solution lies in a global response and you are well suited to drum up that response. Other leaders from countries similarly plagued by Ebola will be making their various cases; they will be competing for the ears and hands of the economic powers meeting at the 69th General Assembly of the United States. Liberia cannot afford to lose the grand opportunity in these critical times. We trust you can do better. You need to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for listening to voice of reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The microbiologist who helped identify the Ebola virus in 1976 has urged David Cameron to support a &quot;quasi-military intervention&quot; to stop the epidemic that is spreading unchecked in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was now so bad that a UN peacekeeping force ought to be mobilised in Sierra Leone and Liberia, with huge donations of beds, ambulances and trucks as well as an army of clinicians, doctors and nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment, I'm not so optimistic. I'm pessimistic about how to control it. It's one thing to isolate patients or put a small village or town in quarantine; it's another thing when entire countries are affected,&quot; he said. &quot;This requires a state of emergency and a kind of quasi-military intervention - and it's not my style to exaggerate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piot, who has worked for the UN and the World Health Organisation, said the US and UK efforts were good, but not good enough. &quot;It's all going far too slow; I think there's still no sense that this is an absolute emergency and catastrophe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the &quot;formidable management challenge&quot; that lies ahead, he said the biggest question for him was what would happen if the disease spread to &quot;megacities&quot; in Nigeria, where there have already been seven deaths from 19 confirmed cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the reasons for this being out of control is because of the slow response both from the national community and the international community, with the exception of Medecins sans Frontieres,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piot said the Ebola outbreak had been discussed at a meeting of the government's Cobra national emergencies committee last month, so he knew Cameron had been briefed on the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I call on the government and the prime minister to intensify the country's efforts and provide assistance, and to accelerate it also.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Cameron should sanction the release of up to 100 NHS doctors and nurses to go to Sierra Leone and Liberia and called on the UN to put an international emergency programme into action. &quot;There is no way that the three countries affected most can handle this on their own,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Guardian, Piot also called on British Airways and other airlines including Air France to resume flying to the two countries, saying the closure of services this summer &quot;has not been helpful&quot; to the aid effort. He said security could be guaranteed if passengers were screened before boarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Belgian, now based in London, he co-discovered the virus in Zaire 38 years ago but never thought he would see an outbreak of this scale. It has already affected four countries and claimed about 2,300 lives, more than the combined total of all previous outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piot, who is working behind the scenes to provoke a sense of urgency at government level, said the head of the UN's peacekeeping operations in Liberia had already offered to assist, but that the force needed training. The African Union has also offered to get involved on a military level, but again needs outside help from experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an enormously complicated logistics job. Frankly, the military, together with DHL and so on, and companies who do transport and delivery, they would be extremely useful,&quot; Piot added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the UN high commissioner for refugees to get involved, together with other agencies which deal with disasters including the International Rescue Fund, chaired by David Miliband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This should be the last epidemic of Ebola where all we have is quarantine and isolation,&quot; Piot said. &quot;What we need the next time are stockpiles of drugs or treatments or vaccines in countries where undoubtedly the virus will resurface.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Piot, who co-discovered Ebola in 1976, said a 'quasi-military intervention' was needed to stop the virus spreading</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A graphic guide to the Scottish referendum that filled the centre spread of yesterday's print edition (11 September, pages 24 and 25) gave &quot;campaign spending&quot; figures of &pound;1,383,000 for &quot;yes&quot; and &pound;2,416,475 for &quot;no&quot;. In fact those figures relate not to spending but to totals of donations of over &pound;7,500 received by the Yes Scotland and Better Together campaigns respectively in the period 18 December 2013 to 21 August 2014, as recorded by the Electoral Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* We erred in saying the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation had announced that it would spend &quot;$50m (&pound;31m) - on top of $10m already committed - to support the emergency response to west Africa's Ebola outbreak&quot; (Gates charity to spend $60m on fighting Ebola, 11 September, page 30). In fact $50m is the total sum pledged, including the $10m announced previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A panel accompanying a feature on football's loan system (How loan system turned into the Wild West of football, 10 September, page 4, Sport) said that Rio Ferdinand caught Manchester United's eye while on loan at Bournemouth from West Ham.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1080 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday this paper carried a front page story, captioned:&quot; Substandard Drugs Discovered At ABEER Pharmacy,&quot; in which it was reported that the Liberia Medicines &amp; Health Products Regulatory Authority (LMHRA), the confiscation of several substandard drugs from the ABEER Pharmacy, one of the leading pharmacies in the country. The action was carried out by the agency in the wake of concerns about fake, expired and substandard drugs on the Liberian market. The agency took the action days after it warned against the sale of fake drugs to the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LMHRA was set up in 2001, among other things, to register all medicines that are locally manufactured, imported, distributed, sold and used in Liberia; prepared, update and keep the register of medicines used in both the private and public sector in Liberia; to remove from the register and prohibit manufacture, importation, distribution sale and use of any medicine whose quality, safety or efficacy is brought to question and to set up a quality control laboratory to undertake laboratory analysis of all medicines to be imported and used in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the agency's action during a press conference on Wednesday, Managing Director, David Sumo, said the LMHRA has been invited to play a role in the Ebola outbreak in the country but however they, being a government entity, the LMHRA will continue playing its role and keep engaging other institutions most especially the Ministry of Health to ensure that drugs that are coming into the country are secured for the benefit of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, he said his agency is actively engaged with the private sectors because the private sectors are key components of the health care delivery system and that the agency is vigorously doing its best to ensure that drugs that are in the country are good to protect the citizens from harmful effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the agency is also committed to ensuring that drugs donated to the government in the wake of the fight against Ebola are safe for human consumption, especially at this time when many persons are rushing to pharmacies because of the limited medical facilities. The agency's manager noted that it is possible in such a situation that people may want to exploit it to the detriment of the Liberian people. In his words he said, &quot;In a situation like this someone can use this means to win and we become the victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the campaign of the agency on such a matter is commendable, more so at this time of the dreadful Ebola virus when many of our people look up to pharmacies because many medical facilities lack the capacity to meet the growing demand for treatment. For me, I take special interest in keeping and maintaining the ethics of the journalism profession because in such a situation, it is imperative or mandatory for the media to get the other side of the story. The agency explained that it took the action during a press conference because the pharmacy was found to be in possession of substandard drugs. That was what is usually referred to as &quot;the side of the agency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this, it then behooves the media institution, like THE INQUIRER that decided to run the story to make sure that it is &quot;balanced.&quot; That is, by getting the other side of the story (a reaction or comment from the pharmacy), which is best practice in the journalism profession, especially as it relates to stories that center on an allegation such as the issue of &quot;substandard drugs,&quot; by a major pharmacy which is not something to be treated with triviality, as it involves people's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in adherence to this ethical requirement that this paper decided to get the side of the pharmacy, which indisputably is one of the biggest pharmacies in the country, which is involved in both wholesale and also retailing. Surprisingly to this paper, the manager of the pharmacy declined to comment, and discourteously obnoxiously said:, &quot;I do not run my Pharmacy in the Press. You can publish anything you want to publish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this distasteful comment from the manager that I have decided to deal with. In all fairness the manager said this because he believes that &quot;nothing will come from this,' just to say it the Liberian way. Many times such actions are taken against business people and nothing is heard about applying the rules that govern such violations, specifically on something that concerns the health of the citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is known, 'laws are made to guide our conduct and behavior. And those punishments are prescribed for any violation thereof. These punishments, among other things are there to serve as deterrence to would-be violators. It is from these laws that regulations and rules are made by some institutions to govern the activities of those institutions and those connected with it. It is in this light that the agency has exposed such unwholesome act by this pharmacy. The million dollar question now is: WHAT NEXT?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority has acted properly in keeping with one of its functions which is &quot;to remove from the register and prohibit manufacture, importation, distribution sale and use of any medicine whose quality, safety or efficacy is brought to question,&quot; but what remains to be seen is whether or not this pharmacy, as I said, which is one of the biggest in the country, would go scot free for this violation. Aren't there punishments in place for such violation? Is this another business as usual? Is the LMHRA a toothless bulldog?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask these questions because I consciously believe that the manager gave the reporter such cheeky remarks, saying. &quot;I do not run my Pharmacy in the Press. You can publish anything you want to publish.&quot; This is not about running one's business in the press; it is about being accused of an unwholesome act, something detrimental to the health of its many customers and consumers of its products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media, as the mouthpiece of the larger society, has a stake in such a matter of a business being accused of having substandard goods. It may not only be a pharmacy today because there are enormous records of how the Ministry of Commerce had taken action against businesses in violation of good practices concerning the sale of goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until appropriate actions are taken against businesses that violate the rules in keeping with their operations, many agencies of government like the LMHRA, would only exist on papers, without making the necessary impact for which they have been established curtailing unwholesome and bad business practices. I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Managing Director of the Forest Development Authority (FDA), Harrison Karnwea says that bush meat is a possible carrier of the deadly Ebola virus, hence the FDA along with its partners have begun a prevention, sensitization and awareness campaign in five counties to deter people from eating or selling bush meat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the official launch of the campaign at the headquarters of the Liberia Crusaders for Peace (LCP) in Monrovia the FDA Managing Director Karnwea said that any animal in the bush can have Ebola, therefore the FDA along with the Liberia National Police will seize bush meat brought to be sold or for personal consumption to help the Government of Liberia and the entire Mano River Basin in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking during the launching program FDA Board Chair, Sister Mary Lauren Brown said the campaign will include interpersonal communication in communities, at market places, agriculture sites, and entertainment centers as well as the airing of Ebola prevention jingles, social mobilization and community outreach with preventative messages on Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued that the FDA with the full support of its Board of Directors collaborating with other partners including Fauna and Flora International and LCP as implementing partner is launching this community based awareness campaign on the prevention of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, the Executive Director of LCP, Culture Ambassador Juli Endee urged the public to save their communities, family and friends by not eating bush meat. She added that no one should say that they have been eating bush meat for a long time, because Ebola has just come to the country so Liberians must now learn how to change some of their behaviors by stopping to eat bush meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Relations Manger for the Ministry of Health, Rev. John Sumo during the launching campaign used the occasion to sensitize Liberians from hiding their sick family members due to Ebola fears, and from burying dead bodies secretly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Liberia Crusaders for Peace (LCP), Executive Director, Juli Endee donated LD 50,000 to the family of Titus Nauaha who was one of two young victims who were shot on August 20, 2014 by Liberian security during a recent showdown between residents of the West Point community and the security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Endee called on the families of Shakie Kamara, another victim of the August 20 showdown and Titus Nauaha, who needs to be flown out of the country for medical evaluation, to unite and don't allow the regrettable incident divide their family or the West Point community at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of young Titus Nauaha, Kissi Johnson thanked the LCP Boss for the donation and called on the entire country to join him to pray for his young son who was once full of life but is now bedridden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the Ebola pandemic in the country, China Union has donated some Food and preventive materials to the citizens of Bong Mines in Fuamah District in lower Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation on behalf of China Union in Bong Mines on Tuesday, September 9, 2014, the PRO of the company, Mr. Morris Tate, said the donation is China Union's own way of identifying with the citizens as the county strives to fight the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items donated include 12 preventive Ebola buckets and 10 bags of twenty-five Kg. bags of rice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items on behalf of the citizens, the Clan Chief of Zeakomu Clan Fuamah District, lower Bong County; Mrs. Farta Yassoh expressed disappointment in China Union and said the citizens of Fuamah District have always been disappointed when it comes to donation and development to the people of Fuamah District, lower Bong County, by China Union. Chief Yassoh said since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the district, this is the first time China Union has made donation to the people of Fuamah; something she said is disappointing to the District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Yassoh said the donation given by China Union to the people of Fuamah District is not sufficient, something she said was not the amount of items that were discussed by the people of Fuamah and China Union to be given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that China Union is a '419' Company operating in Fuamah District lower, Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Yassoh said Coconut Town and YeYeah Town in Fuamah District, lower Bong County have been quarantined by the Superintendent of Bong County, Mrs. Selina Polson Mappy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the head of the Margibi burial team has alarmed that the Ebola death toll in the County is on the increase and speaking to reporters in Margibi County on September 10, 2014, Mr. Henric Marcus Speare said the rising Ebola death toll in the county is due to the unwillingness of the citizens to adhere to the basic principles of hygiene as well as their failure to follow the rules and regulations laid down by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Speare said there are people who are resistant to these rules and regulations adding that it is due to it being strange to Liberians and because of the bad culture Liberians have with respect to hygiene and the basic principle of sanitation which has been in Liberia for centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the issue of washing hands continually and other rules being a new thing, Liberians are still learning and it will take time for Liberians to get adjusted to these rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that Liberians need to be robust in handling the Ebola epidemic that is destroying the lives of fellow compatriots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that initially, the team used to burry three to five bodies but the death toll is rising because people who got infected continue to come in contact with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to use this medium to inform our people that Ebola is real; it exists and it is destroying lives and eventually if we don't do something urgently it may destroy the future of this country,&quot; he asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that not every one dies from Ebola but because the virus is topping the death rate, they treat every case as if it is an Ebola case because there is no rapid response-tracers and investigators as well as health team that is supposed to go ahead with the burial team to conduct investigation and as such they as burial team must take preventative measures to avoid them from contracting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outlining challenges confronting the team, Mr. Henric Marcus Speare said the team gets resistance from affected communities and the use of profound languages by angry people on the team while carrying out its function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stated that people can be seen exposing the team to public ridicule and carrying out mob violence on the team and stating that people are capitalizing on the Ebola issue just to generate money for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Speare said that they also have challenges with the issue of transportation and getting the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the burial team. He however praised the county administration for being able to capacitate the efforts of the burial team with finances and other protective equipment and gasoline to carry on their job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the team has made recommendations to the County Superintendent and the County legislative caucus and he is with the impression that they will rapidly respond to their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Speare said the County Health Team and the burial team are not collaborating, something he lamented that when the burial team removes the dead, the Health Team should remove the sick from the communities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh, says any individual or entity found to have abused the public trust in the management and operations of fund allotted for the fight against the deadly Ebola virus will be prosecuted in accordance with the law. Acting Minister Konneh said the total estimated financial requirement to address the national response was initially quoted at US$2O million dollars, but rose to US$34.8 million when all implementing agencies submitted their three-month budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh said support to all health related interventions in this plan amounts to US$20 million, constituting 84 percent of the entire budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Government of Liberia began the process with an initial injection of US$5 Million, made possible through a short term loan from the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have since intensified our resource mobilization efforts both locally and internationally to secure additional funding for national response. In this direction, we have engaged our bilateral partners and donors to support this effort and we are receiving very favorable commitments both in grant and loan,&quot; Minister Konneh noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further disclosed that to date, through the Trust Fund, government has mobilized a total of US$5.7 million dollars consisting of US$5.6 and LD$9.4 million paid into the Ebola Trust Fund as donations from the government, private individuals and organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the expenditure side, Minister Konneh said after one month of implementation, approximately US$4.7 Million was disbursed to the various implementing agencies as indicated below, leaving an undisbursed balance of approximately US$1.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh said the Ministry of Health has received US$2.8 million, constituting 61.7 percent of the initial funding, as part of the government's initial support to the health sector in dealing with the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further disclosed that US$1.4 million has gone towards payment of per diem for deployed health workers; US$600,000 to procure 12 ambulances; US$300,000.00 as an advance on the construction of various treatment facilities across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have procured vehicles and an assortment of motorbikes, generators and other goods and services to support the work of the Ministry. Please refer to detailed spreadsheet for disbursements to various agencies.The requested expenditure for September 2014, subject to evaluation, is US$5M, US$3.3 million (or 67.5%J of which was allotted to the Health Sector,&quot; Minister Konneh added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting Minister said as part of the government's effort to fight Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), it has prioritized key activities within the Health and Security Sectors through the National Budget for Fiscal Year 2014/2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to date disbursed US$6.2 million over the period July to August to the Health Sector, targeting the Ministry of Health, John F. Kennedy Hospital, Jackson F. Doe Hospital, Phebe Hospital and other county health centers and systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said separately, government has disbursed through the budget a total of US$1,276,339.00 to the Security Sector and has also provided to five affected counties 556, 150.00 USD dollars from the county and social development fund to fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The President shares the public's deep concerns about accountability around the use of these funds. We, therefore, want to inform you that we have a team of financial experts including staff of the MFDP and the Internal Audit Secretariat who are dedicated to ensure that all compliance issues are dealt with. Our processes for disbursement are phased so that full report is made of the first disbursement prior to release of the next tranche. Moreover, once disbursed to the implementing agencies, the General Auditing Commission is mandated by law to conduct a comprehensive audit of this fund,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at the Liberian Senate yesterday, hearing news that Minister Konneh had been discussing the report of the National Task Force at the Ministry of Information regular press briefing became a topic of debate by senators apparently during their executive session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is not yet known if the National Task Force has submitted its report to the National Task Force as insinuated by District number 6 Representative Edwin Snowe yesterday but neither the Liberian Senate or the House of Representatives discussed any issue of the report or anything similar to an Ebola report from the National Task Force in its plenary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But following their closed door session, one of the senators who had been raising serious contention was Bomi County's senator Sando Johnson who said as far as they are concerned the report has not reached them therefore it has not been presented because by doing so at the Ministry of Information was a big error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Johnsons said the US$5 million was made available out of taxes to the National Task Force to fight Ebola by the National Legislature and for someone to suggest that the report in that direction should not be made to them or it is too early to present a report, he sees it as misdirection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Johnson said the National Legislature cannot say anything about the report when it is not before it and in fact the idea of receiving a report on the expenditure of the fund is not to spot out corrupt individuals but to inform the Liberian people correctly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Johnson said the government, especially on the Ebola fight, needs to inform the public because this Ebola fight is not a secret thing and those who are leading the task force are politicians who are only in the lead for name suggesting that they need to leave it to health practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a communication will be sent to the President to officially present to that body the report describing whatever was read by Minister Konneh at the press briefing as being merely done on his own. He blamed his colleague Representative Edwin Snowe for telling the President that the report should not be presented to the National legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Snowe said to tell the President to report now is like giving an ultimatum which was not the proper way for doing it. Admitting on the Truth FM Breakfast Show, he said he asked the President if it was not early to make the report and she said no therefore they all had to agree with her in that direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the President informed him that the report will have the full compliance with the GAC and that the government has to work now as a unit and let the citizens call on them to keep their feet to the fire but the fight against Ebola cannot be won if their government is divided because one cannot be the advocate and leader at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated further that if they want to play national advocate role they should play it but if they claim to be leaders, they should play the leadership role and that is what the citizens need to call on them to do. He said the State of Emergency that is now in the country was voted for by two-third of the National Legislature and they must work as a unit because being divided now is like shooting themselves in the leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the citizenry has every right to be frustrated and disenchanted about what is going on and that should make them all passionate adding, &quot;this is our fight as a unit and we as leaders cannot be there now to say the government has failed or we should as well resign from the government because it is us who have failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Snowe said there are challenges and as a government nobody needs to tell them especially as this is the first time Ebola has reached this peak.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international charity, HIS Church, based in Lincolnshire, the United Kingdom has dispatched three- 40 foot containers to Liberia containing food and non-food items to assist indigent communities throughout the country in the wake of the untold sufferings caused by the Ebola virus outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The items, estimated at $1.4 million United States dollars, are in response to a special appeal made to the charity by the Vice President, Joseph N. Boakai recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Coordinator at HIS Church Charity, Mr. Richard Humphrey, &quot;his organization is immensely pleased to identify with Liberia at this critical time in the country's history especially considering the devastating effect the ongoing Ebola virus has had on the human capacity and infrastructure developments initiated by the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking further he said, one of the containers is loaded specifically with items to assist communities devastated by the Ebola outbreak. The items include mattresses, beddings, kitchenware, clothing, sewing machines, high grade Basmati rice, high visibility jackets, handbags, anti-bacteria lotions among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that &quot;the food and non-food items are intended to assist residents in quarantined communities with basic needs while helping to contain the spread of the virus and the lost of additional lives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the loading bay in Lincolnshire, the Liberian Ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, His Excellency Rudolf von Ballmoos thanked HIS Church Charity on behalf of the President, government and people of Liberia for the huge consignment of items designated for the people of Liberia, noting that, &quot;the gesture on the part of HIS Church Charity demonstrates the level of concern shown by international organizations towards the eradication of the Ebola virus from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, the unexpected emergence of the Ebola virus at a time when the government is pursuing a protracted transformation agenda following years of civil conflict has the potential to cause distractions but assured that the government of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf remains committed to eliminating the virus from the country with the support of all friendly governments and international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The containers are being loaded at the Felixstowe port outside of London and is expected to arrive in Liberia by the end of September.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the wide spread of the deadly Ebola virus in the city, residents of the By-pass community have reported the death of 18 persons in the community with at least 47 suspected cases of Ebola. Yesterday, hundreds of angry residents and community dwellers set up roadblock in protest to a suspected Ebola body which they said have been locked indoor for the past three days in the Rock Spring Community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents through their Chairman, Joseph S. Kannah and Madam Ernestine King said since the death of a boy identified as Alvin Nyanti commonly known as Chineseboy in the community they have made several calls to the Ebola Response Center but to no avail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kannah said about 16 persons were suspected of having the virus in the Rock Spring Community who have been continuously denied by the various treatment centers due to limited capacity to host them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kannah and Madam King said some of the victims went to the various treatment centers on their own but were denied as they were told that there was no space. As a result of the limited capacity according to them, Chineseboy met his untimely demise because he was refused treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the boy died on Tuesday, we have been calling the response team but no one is willing to come and pick up the body and take those suspected of having the virus,&quot; Miss King told this paper minutes following the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the community Chairman, Kannah disclosed that so far 18 persons have died from the Ebola virus and 47 more are suspected of contracting the virus in the entire community. They called on government to ensure that those affected be taken to a treatment center so that the entire community would not be affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Montserrado County Representative, Acarous Gray has described as provocative government's response to Ebola deaths. Rep. Gray said the delay in removing bodies from communities despite persistent calls by residents has the propensity to create chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Gray made the assertion yesterday when hundreds of angry residents set up roadblocks on the Capitol By-pass demanding the removal of the body of a youth who died in the community whose body has been in his residence since Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, hundreds of angry residents stormed the home of Montserrado County District#8 Representative, Acarous Gray for what they call the lawmaker's lack of concern of what is affecting them in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry residents mainly youths threw stones at the lawmaker's house demanding the immediate removal of the body. However, the situation was put under control with the immediate intervention of officers of the Liberia National Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following frantic efforts, police in Monrovia broke out the protest and removed the roadblock and dispersed the protesters after nearly two hours. But residents accused the police of beating peaceful citizens who were protesting for their right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body was later removed by the Ebola Response Unit yesterday following serious commotion and intervention of the police.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sr. Barbara said the ToT will focus on four main areas of concentration. &quot;The training will be an opportunity for participants to be aware of the best information available to date in dealing with the disease and will concentrate mainly on four key areas: support to those who have recovered from the disease, prevention and community outreach, reopening and care of Catholic health centers, and pastoral support at burial sites. She said the training will also reinforce the Church's desire to protect health care workers and staff. &quot;We already have in country PPE's including anti-Ebola gloves, masks, overalls, soap, bleach, thermometers and other items that are being immediately given out to staff members.&quot; She then disclosed that all staff and logistics of the MPCHS have been committed and deployed to the anti-Ebola response of the Church to support the government in fighting the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminar lead facilitator Dr. Timothy Flanigan said the training will be done within the framework and protocol of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare guidelines. &quot;The epidemic is still going up and will be hard to control because of the close living conditions in Monrovia&quot; and so this training is essential in empowering the people to work in their own parishes, communities, and families.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Failure to Contain Ebola - Whose Fault [column]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1817 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to the civil war that devastated this nation, Liberians have known no calamity of competing peril than the Ebola epidemic that is currently sweeping the nation with the death toll rising by the hour. Even those in the international community who had rushed to the nation's aid are now shaking their heads in disbelief - predicting only that the situation will worsen before it improves. But why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some say that is because the government has not been proactive and upfront in its approaches. Others think the country's health system is not up to the task. Defense Minister Brownie Jeffrey Samukai, Jr., agrees - partially. He believes the people - the cowering victims - are culpable, for they have been shooting themselves in the leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Analyst has been looking at his September 9, 2014 address to the UN Security Council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Minister Brownie J. Samukai says part of the reason the Ebola epidemic has been refractory to conventional medical and security response is that the Liberian people are heedless. The other reason, according to him, is that international response was initially inadequate and slow in coming. He was, however quick to note that that response has since gathered momentum and is becoming impactful through the efforts of the United Nations, Africa Union, and friendly governments and institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He implied that once well-targeted aid began flowing in sufficiently and on time and the beneficiaries of such efforts began heeding safety, quarantine, and other regulations, the epidemic would be on its way out of the country. The Liberian defense official made the observations when he addressed, on behalf of the Liberian government, the United Nations Security Council Meeting on the 28th Report of the Secretary-General on the activities of UNMIL on September 9, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question many are asking in relations to the Minister's UN remarks, is just how has the people's supposed heedlessness rendered uncontainable the raging Ebola epidemic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Samukai maintained that in spite of the Sirleaf Administration's targeted measures to contain the epidemic, the death toll continues to rise daily because the people were engaged in activities that directly impede progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In spite of all these measures, continue denial, traditional practices, religious rituals, fear and community resistance still constitute obstacles to progress,&quot; the Liberian defense boss told the UNSC meeting presided by the US Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Samantha Power. He gave no examples of the inimical denial, traditional practices, religious rituals, fear, and community resistance that still constituted obstacles to progress, but he disclosed that the administration was not resting on its oars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government is using all available means to overcome these obstacles and minimize the actions of mob violence and other infractions of peace and security,&quot; he said, again giving no details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to the moment, the Sirleaf Administration has committed so much resources and efforts to the fight against the Ebola epidemic, Minister Samukai told the UNSC meeting attended by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), Ms Karin Landgren. Also prominent amongst those in attendance was Swedish Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Marten Grunditz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rapid spread of this virus created a health crisis, requiring the President to institute measures aimed at containment,&quot; he said. The measures, according to him, included the creation of a National Task Force on Ebola headed by the President herself, the creation of an Incident Management Team headed by the Ministry of Health and the declaration of a 3-month state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Additional measures included one-month compulsory leave for non-essential government employees, now extended for a second month, to limit human to human contact. Communities with high incidence of infections were contained and, in specific cases, quarantined in order to limit movement. A nationwide curfew is currently in place,&quot; the defense boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said there was more: &quot;The Government of Liberia launched an awareness campaign with the full support of UNMIL, the Liberian media, civil society organizations, the business community, and other bilateral and international partners. &quot;The Government also, through the national Legislature, provided an initial allocation of $5 million dollars to support the national strategy against the spread of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A subsequent appeal was made to the international community to provide financial, logistical, and material support for the implementation of the national strategy which prioritized the following actions: Personal protection and safety of healthcare workers - providing better health care services for all Ebola virus disease cases (EVDs), and providing general health care for the population, among other measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister conceded in passing that the health infrastructure, which he described as &quot;weak&quot;, has been overwhelmed by the epidemic, which has gravely affected a number of doctors, nurses, and auxiliary health workers, leaving many dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded further, &quot;From the few cases in March 2014, the pandemic has mushroomed into a health emergency exceeding the Government's response capacity. As we speak, this deadly disease continues to spread and cause havoc in many communities. Nine of the fifteen counties in Liberia are currently affected. Liberia lacks the infrastructure, logistical capacity, professional expertise and financial resources to effectively address this disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however did not say how the &quot;weak health infrastructure&quot; - made worse by the creation of fear and panic within the health community - and the initial slow international response compared with the inimical community practices in obstructing the administration's progress in the fight against the spread of the virus. This leaves observers to wonder what in the administration's mind constitutes a major obstacle to the containment of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers, who contended during talks with our reporters that they could not see how fear and religious practices undermined the administration's so-called well-planned and executed measures, noted that the Minister needed to explain his assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the administration is convinced that it is not containing the epidemic using its well-planned measures because of something untoward the people are doing, then it must face the people squarely,&quot; said one observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued: &quot;Minister Samukai must tell us the 'all available means' exerted 'to overcome these obstacles and minimize the actions of mob violence and other infractions of peace and security'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was only if the government was forthcoming with what it determined to be obstacles to the containment of the virus that it would be able to enlist the services of relevant civil society organizations in reversing the inimical practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the administration will heed the call - and even if it did, it will get the relevant cooperation from the population - analysts say, remains part of the jigsaw puzzle of the rapid spread of the Ebola virus now covering nine of 15 counties and leaving untold casualties in its wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Minister Samukai said the international response that had initially been lackluster, has begun to show signs of significant impact on national efforts to contain the Ebola fight. But according to him the favorable outcome of these efforts would be determined only by the extent to which and the timeframe within which the virus would be contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be candid, the response by the international community to the appeal of our Government and partners, in particular WHO and Medecins Sans Frontiere (MSF) was initially less than robust,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister, however, thanked UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon &quot;for his leadership and initiatives in focusing global attention on this virus, including his appointment of a Special Coordinator for Ebola in the person of Dr. David Nabarro&quot;. Under Dr. Nabarro guidance, he said, the UN has initiated efforts to &quot;mobilize resources and coordinate the scaling up of interventions to bring surge capacity to bear in response to this tragic situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are equally appreciative of the action taken by the African Union in dispatching a technical team and making funding available to support national efforts. Even today, the African Union has issued a call to all its Member States to urgently lift all travel bans imposed on countries affected by the Ebola outbreak in Africa. We ask Council members to all use their good offices to support this call,&quot; Minister Samukai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the UNSC meeting that the Ebola epidemic was more than a health issue; and that therefore, unless the world took immediate action to help Liberia overcome it, it is likely to lead to complications of regional proportion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted, &quot;This health emergency is affecting every sector of our society. Our economy has been very seriously disrupted. Local economic activities such as domestic food production, mining, and transport services have been undermined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moreover, the slowdown in domestic food production, particularly in affected areas of the country, has negatively impacted food supply, thus triggering increasing demand for imported commodities, at higher prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hospitality industry has also been seriously affected by the epidemic. Today, only two international airlines, SN Brussels and Air Maroc are flying to and from Liberia. The suspension of flights has accentuated the difficulties we are facing and exacerbated the constraint of humanitarian delivery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the government of Liberia has thanked UNMIL-troop contributing countries and appealed for their solidarity by allowing their forces to continue their assignment in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government is aware that the stakes are high as troop and police contributing countries harbor concerns for the health and safety of their citizens,&quot; the Minister noted why disclosing that to date, no UNMIL staff has been infected by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN plan for scaling up the international response needs to benefit from the use of military assets as well. We thank those countries, which have provided these assets and encourage others to do the same,&quot; the defense Minister suggested. He then disclosed that the government of Liberia supported the UN secretary general's request for a technical rollover of UNMIL's mandate for the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our attention and focus need to be directed towards containing and eliminating the Ebola virus from Liberia and other countries. We encourage continued flexibility on the part of the Council in these very difficult circumstances for Liberia,&quot; he said with hope that further UNSC deliberation would take into account Liberia's dying economy and the humanitarian crisis it is likely to impose upon the subregion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors and healthcare workers at five hospitals in Monrovia have lauded the leadership role being played by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in the fight against the Ebola virus disease currently plaguing the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the healthcare practitioners made the assertions in separate remarks on Tuesday, September 9, when the Liberian leader visited by President Sirleaf visited the Ahmadiya, SDA Cooper, Benson, SOS and James Davis hospitals around Monrovia to ascertain first hand working condition at these facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking when President Sirleaf visited the Benson Hospital in Paynesville City outside Monrovia, the chief medical doctor, Dr. Jimmy Benson said the President's frequent visits to health care centers have further motivated them to do more in saving lives and promised to uphold their oath to duty even during this emergency period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Benson told the Liberian leader that though his facility is a private one, services to the people of Liberia are uninterrupted as regular illnesses including emergencies are being treated there. She thanked the Liberian government for the courage and commitment in the fight against the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Amhadiya Hospital, Dr. Abdulai Harleen Karim said his hospital was happy to serve the Liberian people and has already informed their headquarters in Pakistan about to need to bring in more anti-Ebola materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Karim said the Ahmadiya Hospital has always been open to the Liberian people with a high degree of care by his staff and sometimes have referred those patients showing signs and symptoms of the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Karim expressed the hope that with the personal involvement of President Sirleaf in motivating health workers and counter checking as to whether health facilities are receiving equipment and supply is motivational and expressed the hope that the enthusiasm regained by healthcare workers especially from his hospital will boost the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the SDA Hospital on the 12th Street, authorities there briefed the Liberian leader on the operations at its facilities including the challenge of maintaining constant electricity at the healthcare facility. However, they expressed appreciation to President Sirleaf for her intervention recently when she supplied a consignment of fuel oil to the hospital as government's support to healthcare facilities during this Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At each stop to the hospitals and health centers, President Sirleaf admonished healthcare workers to keep up the fight as government is doing everything to protect them against getting infected while treating other illnesses or the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital Dr Karim briefs President Sirleaf briefs President Sirleaf about their activities of the healthcare facility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed the health care practitioners that her visit to these hospitals was to abreast herself about the challenges and prospects during this emergency period and what all of them can do to further enhance the healthcare delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she has always done, she donated assorted food items to the hospitals and healthcare facilities and promised to review their respective list of needed items and respond quickly as a means of creating the enabling environment to carry out their duties as health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the James Davis Hospital, President Sirleaf again reiterated government's commitment to provide improved incentives for health care workers and this was on the verge of being concluded. She encouraged them to remain focused on providing healthcare to Liberians in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader was responding to the plea by Dr. James Kekeh that lack of incentives for health care workers was a serious constraint on the free of charge hospital and pleaded for the government's intervention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Club yesterday donated several bags of rice and other assorted items to the National Task Force as its own way of identifying with victims of the deadly epidemic that has engulfed the country with at least thirteen counties of Liberia's fifteen being affected by Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief chat minutes following the donation, Mr. Rupert C. Hoff, Sr. President of Royal Friends Club said his organization is very concerned about the rapid spread of the Ebola virus and the numbers of lives it continues to claim across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hoff said Royal Friends Club is a social and charitable organization void of politics, and that the virus has become a national issue that must claim the attention of all Liberians and then reminded Liberians that Ebola is real and has the propensity to destroy the entire nation and damage the economy of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Friends President added that predicated upon the rapid spread and the wave of death tolls as a result of the Ebola outbreak that all must get involved in the fight against the deadly pestilence to ensure that it is eradicated from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Royal Friends Club has seen the need to also join the fight with its little resources to intensify the fight against the virus. Some of the items donated to the Ebola Task Force by the Royal Friends Club include, fifteen bags of rice and other assorted items.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia Medicines &amp; Health Products Regulatory Authority (LMHRA) has confiscated several substandard drugs from Abeer Pharmacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LMHRA has at the same time, warned importers of fake drugs to desist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LMHRA Manager Director, David Sumo, made this statement yesterday at a press conference held at the LMHRA office in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MD. Sumo said the LMHRA has been invited to play a role in the Ebola outbreak in the country but however they being a government entity, the LMHRA will continue playing their role and keep engaging other institutions most especially the Ministry of Health to ensure that drugs that are coming into the country are secured for the benefit of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that LMHRA is tightly engaged with the private sectors because the private sectors are key components of the health care delivery system and that they are doing their work to ensure that drugs that are in the country are good so that citizens can be protected from harmful effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MD. Sumo stated that ensuring the quality of drugs being donated to the government in the fight against the Ebola virus is a key issue. &quot;In a situation like this someone can use this means to win and we become the victims,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned that since the Ebola outbreak many citizens have decided to buy their own drugs to have them treated due to fear because during that time hospitals and clinics would have been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MD. Sumo said there has been lots of awareness made since the Ebola outbreak but there are still more new cases which indicate that the virus is still spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that public awareness, using community leaders, head of homes, and community dwellers will better take the message to the people and it will really help in the eradication of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MD. Sumo said that those with fever, malaria amongst others should report themselves early for treatment and that pharmacy stores should not diagnose and treat anyone which is not their role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted yesterday, the Manager of the Pharmacy declined to comment, obnoxiously saying, &quot;I do not run my Pharmacy in the Press. You can publish anything you want to publish.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moreover, the slowdown in domestic food production, particularly in affected areas of the country, has negatively impacted food supply, thus triggering increasing demand for imported commodities, at higher prices, minister Samukai said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the UN plan for scaling up the international response needs to benefit from the use of military assets as well adding, &quot;We thank those countries which have provided these assets and encourage others to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, Minister Samukai assured the UN Security Council that the Government of Liberia fully supports the Secretary-General's request for a technical roll-over of UNMIL's mandate for the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our attention and focus need to be directed towards containing and eliminating the Ebola virus from Liberia and other countries.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statement by Hon. Brownie J. Samukai Minister of National Defense at the United Nations Security Council Meeting on the 28th Report of the Secretary-General on the activities of UNMIL, September 9, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SRSG Langren</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Marten Grunditz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and Gentlemen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a privilege for me to participate, for the second time, in a meeting of this Council on UNMIL activities in Liberia. Let me begin by expressing the profound gratitude of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Government and People of Liberia to the Council for its continued support of peace and stability in Liberia. We also want to congratulate you Madam President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are meeting at a time when Liberia is facing a serious threat to its national existence. The deadly Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the normal functioning of our State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease, which early this year was identified in the remote villages of our country,, has now reached urban centers, including the capital Monrovia. It is now spreading like wild fire, devouring everything in its path. The already weak health infrastructure of the country has been overwhelmed. Health workers, including doctors and nurses, who are at the frontline of the fight to control the disease have been highly affected, with several losing their lives, including some of the country's prominent doctors and nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rapid spread of this virus created a health crisis, requiring the President to institute measures aimed at containment. These measures included establishment of the National Task Force on Ebola, headed by the President herself; creation of an Incident Management Team, led by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and declaration of a State of Emergency for 90 days. Additional measures included one month compulsory leave for non-essential government employees, now extended for second month, to limit human to human contact. Communities with high incidence of infections were contained and, in specific cases, quarantined in order to limit movement. A nation-wide curfew is currently in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia launched an awareness campaign with the full support of UNMIL, the Liberian media, civil society organizations, the business community and other bilateral and international partners. The Government also, through the national Legislature, provided an initial allocation of $5 million dollars to support the national strategy against the spread of the deadly virus. A subsequent appeal was made to the international community to provide financial, logistical and material support for the implementation of the national strategy which prioritized the following actions: Personal protection and safety of healthcare workers - providing better health care services for all ebola virus disease cases (EVDs), and providing general health care for the population, among other measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of all these measures, continue denial, traditional practices, religious rituals, fear and community resistance still constitute obstacles to progress. Government is using all available means to overcome these obstacles and minimize actions of mob violence and other infractions of peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the few cases in March 2014, the pandemic has mushroomed into a health emergency exceeding the Government's response capacity. As we speak, this deadly disease continues to spread and cause havoc in many communities. Nine of the fifteen counties in Liberia are currently affected. Liberia lacks the infrastructure, logistical capacity,, professional expertise and financial resources to effectively address this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be candid, the response by the international community to the appeal of our Government and partners, in particular WHO and Medecins Sans Frontiere (MSF) was initially less than robust. However, we are thankful to the Secretary General for his leadership and initiatives in focusing global attention on this virus, including his appointment of a Special Coordinator for Ebola in the person of Dr. David Nabarro. We are very encouraged by current efforts of the UN to mobilize resources and coordinate the scaling up of interventions to bring surge capacity to bear in response to this tragic situation. We are equally appreciative of the action taken by the African Union in dispatching a technical team and making funding available to support national efforts. Even today, the African Union has issued a call to all its Members State to urgently lift all travel bans imposed on countries affected by the ebola outbreak in Africa. We ask Council members to all use their good offices to support this call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This health emergency is affecting every sector of our society. Our economy has been very seriously disrupted. Local economic activities such as domestic food production, mining, and transport services have been undermined. Moreover, the slowdown in domestic food production, particularly in affected areas of the country, has negatively impacted food supply, thus triggering increasing demand for imported commodities, at higher prices. The hospitality industry has also been seriously affected by the epidemic. Today, only two international airlines, SN Brussels and Air Maroc are flying to and from Liberia. The suspension of flights has accentuated the difficulties we are facing and exacerbated the constraint of humanitarian delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until today, there have been no reports of infections among UNMIL staff, both national and international. The Government is aware that the stakes are high as troop and police contributing countries habour concerns for the health and safety of their citizens. We extend our appreciation to these countries and appeal for their solidarity by allowing their forces to continue their assignment in Liberia. The UN plan for scaling up the international response needs to benefit from the use of military assets as well. We thank those countries which have provided these assets and encourage others to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia fully supports the Secretary-General's request for a technical roll-over of UNMIL's mandate for the next three months. Our attention and focus need to be directed towards containing and eliminating the ebola virus from Liberia and other countries. We encourage continued flexibility on the part of the Council in these very difficult circumstances for Liberia. We also hope that the deliberations will take into account the imperatives of protecting the investment and gains made in Liberia over the years for peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four UN agencies include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UN Women, UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNOPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation Wednesday at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the President of the UN Staff Association, Calixte Hessou said the gesture was the staff's way of helping the government and other partners in the ongoing Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hessou said the 136 pairs of heavy duty rain booths were purchased by the staff of the four UN agencies to assist the government. He put the cost of the donation at over US$1,000.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items, Deputy Health Minister for Administration Matthew Flomo expressed appreciation to the UN Staff Association for the donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Flomo said the continuous support from various UN agencies to the ongoing Ebola fight is laudable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the donation of the rain booths is timely as the Ministry will ensure that items are distributed to various hospitals to help in the Ebola response process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Minister called on employees of other institutions to follow the good examples of the UN Staff Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak considered as the world's worst outbreak has hit at least four countries in Africa and has killed nearly 2,000 people. Over 1,000 persons have reportedly died of the virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Civil Society Organization Taskforce on Ebola says the country is in desperate need of support from the international community to fight Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said the level in which the virus has reached is beyond the Liberian government's control and that the response of the international community is needed to save lives in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference Wednesday in Sinkor, the group's Chairman Oscar Bloh said in recent days a number of donor pledges have been made, but Liberian groups fear that it will take too long for government's promises to translate to hands-on help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloh believes that it is time that wealthy countries and international organizations like the United Nations to accelerate the deployment of much needed resources in dealing with the health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hospitals are over-run and under-staffed; fear and panic are sparking violence. Our borders are shut and ships are avoiding our ports - we are running out of food, supplies, everything,&quot; Mr. Bloh indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloh wants the United Nations, African Union and all donor countries to provide immediate support to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal, while working in a coordinated manner to support medical charities on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This support, he suggested, must come in the form of human, technical and medical resources, including infectious disease experts and disaster relief specialists, particularly to Liberia, which is suffering the most severe impacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of the Liberian CSO Taskforce on Ebola also wants donors to provide substantial resources to ensure that infected people are identified and isolated from the rest of the population to curtail the spread of the virus. Bloh said resources should be directed towards expanding testing centers and establishing treatment facilities closed to affected communities as well as providing ambulances to transport suspected cases. He appealed to the United Nations Mission in Liberia to increase its presence alongside the Liberian police to ensure that national security forces implement measures in a responsible manner..</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">407 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations special envoy to Liberia Karin Landgren has described the spread of Ebola in Liberia as &quot;merciless&quot; and warned that the reported cases and deaths in the country &quot;understate Ebola's true toll.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the UN Security Council that at least 160 Liberian health care workers had contracted the disease and half of them had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The speed and scale of the loss of lives, and the economic, social, political and security reverberations of the crisis are affecting Liberia profoundly,&quot; she said. &quot;Liberians are facing their gravest threat since war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two wars between 1989 and 2003 killed about 250,000 people and led to a complete collapse of Liberia. It was carved up by warlords who often used child soldiers and fought over control of diamond and timber concessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Liberia in 2003 and some 6,000 troops and police are currently there. The mission's mandate is due to be renewed by the Security Council this month and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has recommended a straightforward extension of three months, instead of one year, while the international community tackles Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Defense Minister Brownie Samukai, on a visit to the United States, has informed the United Nations Security Council that the existence of the country is &quot;seriously threatened&quot; by the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the disease is &quot;spreading like wild fire and devouring everything in its path&quot;. Minister Samukai informed the council that Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the normal functioning of the country, which has prompted the government to suspend the senatorial election scheduled for October, schools have been ordered closed indefinitely and sporting activities have been shut down, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed recently that Liberia is worst hit by West Africa's Ebola epidemic and will likely see additional fatalities and cases in coming weeks. Already, more than 1,089 people have died in Liberia from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberia is facing a serious threat to its national existence. The deadly Ebola virus has caused a disruption of the normal functioning of our state,&quot; Minister Samukai told the Security Council on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated that the virus is &quot;... now spreading like wild fire, devouring everything in its path. The already weak health infrastructure of the country has been overwhelmed,&quot; adding that the initial international response was &quot;less than robust.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a week after the Liberian government announced that it had exhausted the initial US$5 million of some US$20 million approved by the national legislature to help contain the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in the country, a member of the Senate says President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf must account for Ebola money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tough-talking Bomi County Senator Sando Johnson said the Liberian leader must provide proper accountability as to how the money was spent amid reports of demands for over 1,000 beds and other essential materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said most hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities are still in short supply of beds, PPEs and essential equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on a popular radio talk show (The Costa Show) recently, Senator Johnson emphasized that President Sirleaf must give account of how every penny was spent, especially when the Liberian people continue to die from Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that it was due to neglect on the part of the government for such a huge number of Liberians to die from Ebola. Senator Johnson also indicated that the government has neglected the condition of health workers who continue to advocate for their benefits, although government had promised them earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bomi County Senator said the condition of Liberians infected by Ebola was appalling and that the money provided for Ebola must make impact in the lives of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week ago, the Coordinator of the National Ebola Task Force, James Dorbor Jallah said the initial US$5 million bankrolled by the national government to help contain the deadly Ebola virus had already been exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jallah explained that the initial US$5 million was a portion of US$20 million approved by the national legislature to underwrite some of the costs associated with the nationwide battle against the infectious Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the Ministry of Health (MOH) alone utilized US$2.9 million of the US$5 million. However, Mr. Jallah did not explain how the balance of the US$2.1 was expended, but he noted that line ministries and other auxiliary groups associated with the Ebola campaign received money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Jallah, the agencies of government involved in the Ebola campaign include, the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Information, and Defense. Others are the Liberia National Police and the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jallah believes that US$2.9 million allocated for the MOH is infinitesimal to the ministry's original budget of US$23 million it had requested the national legislature to help contain the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

The incident was covered up by the Pentagon until the Seventies, but tragically it emerged that some of the Americans may have been killed by friendly fire. The truth about what exactly happened remains unclear. The film-makers attempt to pin it down.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley, the British nurse who survived the deadly Ebola virus, is planning to return to Sierra Leone to help fight the outbreak, a move his mother, who had hoped he would not go back, hesitantly concedes will make her &quot;very proud&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Guardian interview, Pooley, 29, the first known Briton to contract the virus, called on David Cameron, who sent him get well wishes while he was in hospital, and Barack Obama, to do more to mobilise the international community to get the epidemic, raging through west Africa since March, under control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a global problem and it needs global level leadership so Obama and Cameron . . . need to show some more leadership on this issue,&quot; says Pooley, while acknowledging his &quot;huge gratitude&quot; to the prime minister for his role in his repatriation and care. &quot;Sierra Leone needs lots of international healthcare workers working with big NGOs like MSF and Red Cross. All of that needs to be increased.&quot; Relaxing at home in Suffolk after being discharged, virus-free, from the Royal Free hospital, in London, a week ago, Pooley is happy to have survived his ordeal but also desperate to carry on helping. Some in the profession call it survivor's guilt. &quot;So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there. It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there . . . It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while. The more help they get the less chance there is they get sick. If they get sick they are just going to end up in a ward in Kenema with less chance than I had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley had not discussed his plans to return with his parents, but when asked how she would feel, his mother, Jackie, took a few sharp breaths. &quot;Well, it would be his choice. We would want him to go back, not as an individual but with an organisation of some kind so he's got the backing. Obviously in a way we don't want (him) to, but I can see I would feel very proud of him if he decided he was going to, because he knows what it is going to be like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly it would be different from the state-of-the-art medical treatment Pooley received at the Royal Free, where he was treated after his emergency repatriation. There, he lay inside a polythene &quot;patient isolator&quot; tent, tended by dozens of staff in a unit tailor made for &quot;category four&quot; infectious diseases. The tent alone cost &pound;25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was the first patient in the unit for two years. There were protocols for everything, covering food to removal of materials, including body waste through heat-sealed containers. The ward's floors were colour-coded for contamination and non-contamination sides, and there was a one-way flow of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Mepham, the infectious diseases and microbiology consultant who flew to Sierra Leone to accompany Pooley home when he was evacuated by the RAF 18 days ago, explained that the ward kept its air at negative pressure and that it was systematically replaced because of the possibility of &quot;aerosolisation&quot; of particles. Thousands of miles away in Kenema's government hospital there were few resources and little dignity existed for the dying and convalescing patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley says: &quot;Those wards A and B when I first started were pretty grim. Corpses, blood, the place was really dirty - people just dying in quite unpleasant ways. When I first started there were not enough materials, there was no running water, no sheets or towels to clean a patient with. They might be incontinent, they are often confused, so you can imagine, with diarrhoea and vomiting, patients get in horrible condition. &quot;When I first started there was not a thing that you could use to help them. You'd just have to improvise, find a way of cleaning them and try and find something to cover them with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death can be swift. He felt safe in his personal protective equipment (PPE) but frightened because the infection was liable to be anywhere. His first sign of illness was a sore throat. Overnight he developed aches, a headache and felt &quot;pretty rough&quot; but still went to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That afternoon he was tested and he went home to await the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to sleep then later when it was dark I woke to (see) Ian Crozier, a wonderful doctor who is working with the World Health Organisation. I woke to his voice and his voice was muf-fled, and when I saw he was wearing PPE I knew it was bad news. He was saying to me the kind of stuff I said to patients myself loads and only ever half believed. He was saying to me 'you are young, you are strong, you are going to be fine' - and it's amazing how that can reassure you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes Crozier and others worked on the evacuation. Two American doctors had already been airlifted out of the region. At 4 o'clock the following morning, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, talked. At 6am the evacuation was confirmed. By 10am Mepham was preparing for his trip to Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley still had not told his parents, delaying it until the evacuation was in progress. &quot;Telling mum and dad about having Ebola was just horrible. It was definitely the worst thing of it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, Robin, recalls the conversation. &quot;I think he said 'dad, I've got it'. I said 'you mean?' and he said 'Ebola' and there was a long pause after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley says: &quot;They had loads of support from the Foreign Office and things like that but it doesn't take away from the fact that I had just told them I had a 50% chance of not surviving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father coped by going into &quot;emotional lock down&quot;. His mother said she could not let herself feel pessimistic. Buoyed by the &quot;magnificent&quot; treatment at the Royal Free, they gained comfort from two doctors who had worked with their son in Kenema, and from Hunt who spent time with them at the Royal Free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley says he has been touched by the cards he has had from the public. A Sierra Leone family went to the hospital to give him children's drawings and thank him; another sent 50 red roses to his house, joking that he now needed to find a &quot;Salone&quot; (Sierra Leonean) wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Firestone Medical Center yesterday reintegrated five Ebola survivors into society declaring them free of the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the reintegration program held in Camp One, Harbel, Margibi County, the Medical Director of Firestone Health Services, Dr. Lyndon Mabande, said health workers are going beyond their borders to save lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that residents in various communities across Liberia must stop discouraging and frightening health workers but to support and encourage them to continue saving lives. Dr. Mabande is encouraging Liberians to restrict their movements and take the necessary preventive measures as prescribed by the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Mabande who presented Levi Zeobuegar and his late sister's three children to the community said no disease has ever scared health workers in Liberia like the Ebola virus. He said health workers are depending on community dwellers to call them whenever there is a suspected case in a community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said health workers are saving the lives of those suffering from the Ebola virus as a result of the many calls they usually receive from various communities. He assured the public that the five survivors are very well and there is no trace of the Ebola virus in them and called on the community to accept the five survivors calling on their families not to reject them as they need the support of their families and neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking on behalf of his immediate family, including his niece and nephews, one of the survivors,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levi Zeobuegar said he contacted the disease when he touched the bathing towel that was used by his sister who also died from the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zeobuegar praised the Almighty God for healing him and lauded the health workers at Firestone Medical Center for saving his life and his family. Zeobuegar said health workers in the country are risking their lives on a daily basis to save the lives of their fellow compatriots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Public Relation Manager of Firestone, Rufus Karmo during the ceremony presented a purse, a new furnished building and some assorted items to Mr. Zeobuegar to enable him and his family continue their normal life again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Gaye, 14, who also survived the Ebola virus, was turned over to her family and community by Dr. Mabande. He used the occasion to urge community dwellers to assist little Grace by showing her love and care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace was presented with a certificate declaring her free of the deadly disease along with a purse and other assorted items. Thanking God for saving his daughter's life, Mr. Samuel Gaye Sr. said he was astounded because he had already given up his daughter's survival.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference in Paynesville, outside Monrovia, officials of Medicine Sans Frontier (MSF) commented on the limited space at the ELWA Ebola Center which cannot contain the several cases brought to the center on a daily basis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurence Sailly, MSF-Liberia ELWA-3 Emergency Coordinator during the interview said, Liberia's case is different from the entire Mano River Union Basin. According to her, the ELWA-3 facility which was opened since Monday, August 18, 2014, has about 140 beds, 360 local Liberian staff members and 55 International staff members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were 489 patients to care for and 51 persons already recovered from the deadly Ebola virus and both the local and International staff members of the facilities are working overnight to see how best they can curb the virus in the country,&quot; Madam Sailly stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ELWA-3 facility Boss said, other projects in Monrovia are being exerted to help provide efficiency and increase the capacity of the center. Currently according to MSF-Liberia, about 400 Liberians have been trained and are carrying out door to door voluntary messages to help prevent the virus across Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Calver Mission Community, Mr. Anthony Kpan, has also alarmed over the limited space in accepting patients at the MSF ELWA-3 Center in ELWA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Kpan, recently, some suspected cases of patients believed to be having the Ebola virus were denied entry to the center due to what the Studio Junction Community Chairman called lack of enough space to host the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to newsmen, Mr. Kpan said, Community residents in the area expressed over what appeared like a complete drama when sick persons who were brought to the facility were denied only because there was no enough space at that facility to take them in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however lauded the International staff of MSF, including Representative Snowe and the Government of Liberia for little effort being put in place to curb the emergency cases that has been brought to the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kpan is meanwhile calling on both local and International NGO's to respond urgently to the calls of MSF-Liberia to save lives. Several persons living within the vicinity of the ELWA treatment center are also calling on the Government of Liberia to respond urgently to the call of MSF-Liberia to avoid the recurrence of the last week's episode which left the community vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this paper, the residents said, most of the sick persons that were turned down slept in the community and seriously imposed fear amongst community dwellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents are also calling on Hon. Edwin M. Snowe to at least provide them with those preventive materials like soap, bleaches, chlorine, clorox and buckets to help prevent the rapid spread of the Ebola virus in the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lutheran Church in Liberia (LCL) will this week deliver a truck-load of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and other medical supplies to Gbarpolu County as efforts to join the fight against the deadly Ebola virus that is taking toll on the country. The food items and other disinfectants according to the Lutheran Bishop will be gathered by all 51 LCL parishes around Liberia evidenced by the congregations' adherence to last Sunday, September 7 being declared as 'Stand against Ebola Day' in the Lutheran Church throughout the country where items were gathered for distribution in Ebola endemic areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lutheran Bishop in Liberia, D. Jensen Seyenkulo told scores of reporters yesterday in the administrative compound of the LCL that since the outbreak of the virus, the LCL has been supporting government in the areas of mediating the love and showing the care of God to Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Seyenkulo said contributions are coming from all of the parishes and that the items on hand as of the time of releasing the statement were from only three parishes for onward distribution as the LCL way of saying, &quot;We appeal to our partners; we do not want to just sit and wait; we are doing something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the church has been dealing with the urgency of doing something and that has begun with reaching out to hospitals, health care centers around the country with Ebola preventives and other medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts made so far by the LCL as initial support in dealing with the urgency are that Liberia has been receiving and delivering Ebola preventives and other medical supplies from Global Health Ministries, operation Blessing International and the Episcopal Relief and Development Organization through the Episcopal Church of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Seyenkulo said through the LCL-ZOE and Malaria Program, the LCL has provided Ebola preventive materials to 240 households of orphans and vulnerable children in Kakata, Margibi County while at the same time the LCL has streamlined Ebola into its programs including psycho-social counseling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the LCL said sickness and deaths have been part of the normal course of life since the fall of mankind and disagrees with those who characterize God in ways that run contrary to the biblical revelation of God in the wake of the Ebola outbreak especially in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Seyenkulo stated, &quot;God we know and serve neither timid nor weak and to suggest that God is punishing this poor little nation because of her sins is to say that God is too scared or weak to take on the more powerful nations that are just as sinful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God is not a God who kills because of sin. While it is true that He hates sin, He loves sinners. We are only plagued with this Ebola because of where we find ourselves. This is the gospel message that we believe and that is what we preach,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization has warned that Liberia is set to see a huge spike in infections from the Ebola epidemic ravaging West Africa, with thousands of new cases imminent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN agency on Monday said the country, worst-hit in the outbreak with almost 1,100 deaths, faced &quot;many thousands&quot; of new infections in the next three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WHO and its director-general will continue to advocate for more Ebola treatment beds in Liberia and elsewhere, and will hold the world accountable for responding to this dire emergency with its unprecedented dimensions of human suffering,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadliest Ebola epidemic the world has ever seen is spreading across West Africa, with Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, countries worst affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths, and &quot;the number of new cases is increasing exponentially&quot;, the WHO warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key development partners trying to help Liberia respond to the outbreak &quot;need to prepare to scale up their current efforts by three- to four-fold,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries bearing the brunt of the epidemic are among the world's poorest, with dilapidated medical infrastructures that have all but buckled under the strain of trying to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the outbreak, Liberia had only one doctor to treat every 100,000 patients in a total population of 4.4 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that 152 healthcare workers in the country have been infected and 79 have died, the WHO said the ratio had worsened significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN body described how taxis filled with entire families, including members suspected of having Ebola, criss-crossed Monrovia &quot;searching for a treatment bed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are none. As WHO staff in Liberia confirm, no free beds for Ebola treatment exist anywhere in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Ebola patients are turned away from treatment centres, &quot;they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes, where they inevitably infect others, perpetuating constantly higher flare-ups in the number of cases,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Montserrado County alone, which includes Monrovia, the agency said 1,000 beds were urgently needed to treat Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the scramble to halt the contagion, some affected countries have quarantined whole regions, while others so far free of the virus have halted flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chief of the African Union Commission, called Monday for travel bans imposed to stem the epidemic to be lifted, &quot;to open up economic activities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told a crisis meeting in Addis Ababa there was an urgent need to &quot;craft a united, comprehensive and collective African response&quot; to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she also warned that in the battle to stop the spread, &quot;We must be careful not to introduce measures that may have more... social and economic impact than the disease itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts have warned that economic losses caused by the restrictions were adding to the continent's woes, with some arguing that travel bans even slowed medical help getting to affected areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partnership has brought about 300 adolescent girls together for training on the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">471 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anytime Annie Hears the siren of the ambulance, memories about dead relatives and friends in her community leave her horrified. In one week, she and others who miraculously survived the scourge of the disease have literally seen scores of people struggled to death from the Ebola virus that is showing no sign of waning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everywhere In Liberia news about dead people resonates around the world which portrays a deteriorating state of affairs in the West African country. Health workers are seen in squalid communities, pathways and in homes taking bodies away for proper interment. It is difficult to determine whether the dead are victims of the Ebola virus since there's no testing center to verify Ebola victims from those victimized by other medical conditions. Liberia finds itself in a precarious situation, far above its capacity to cope with the unending calamity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Week, The World Health Organization (WHO) says a total of 2,000 people have died in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Liberia and over 4,000 cases have been reported in the sub-region of which Liberia registers more than 200 new cases per week, Sierra Leone, more than 150 per week and Guinea, 100. The UN agency reported that the total death toll in Liberia is over 1,000, and it warned further that the country is set to see a huge spike in infections cases from the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why This Indicator appears justified, considering the alarming number of Ebola victims, creating testing centers at strategic places and in communities around the country would help to mitigate the fear factor and enable Liberians to be scrupulous about their health. No doubt, we believe that WHO indicator is cogent because of the most recent figure which clearly shows more than 1,089 Ebola victims in the country. However, the challenge is what should we do as a nation and people to ensure that infectious cases wane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honestly, Our Government may have some good intentions, but it simply lacks the capacity and experience to deal with such a calamity that is far beyond its capabilities. Every day bodies are taken from homes, communities and pathways. People are infected without even knowing that they are carriers of the infectious disease. Therefore, the government must create more isolation centers and ensure that mattresses and other essential Ebola materials are delivered on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our People Are panicking, at the same time, others are engaged in the act of denial which continues to undercut our tenacity to remain unthreatened as a people and nation. However, while this is true, most Liberians have lost confidence in the government handling of the Ebola situation. They believe that the government isn't doing much to reverse the trend in the reported cases of infections and death. Therefore, the international community must help us find a way out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of the House of Representatives has warned Senators and Representatives engaged in criticizing the executive branch for failing to fight the Ebola virus in the country to desist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Edwin Snowe claimed that those bent on such venture are seeking irresponsible political relevance at the expense of the Ebola virus. Representative Snowe said comments by lawmakers some of whom are contesting in the pending Special Senatorial Election are reckless and do not in any way represent their status as government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe said it is appalling to see individuals who are needed most at this critical time in the country to join forces with other branches of government to shy away from their responsibilities and engage in a blame game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the Legislative Reporters Tuesday in Monrovia, Representative Snowe indicated that in recent times a number of lawmakers has been taking advantage of the Ebola crisis to seek political glory by portraying that the Executive Branch was playing lip-service in caring for its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Snowe said instead of criticizing, both the Legislative and Executive branches of government should join forces to put the degenerating effect of the virus under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My disappointment is coming from those of us in government that go on the air and make reckless statements against the executive as though there are three governments; our constitution provides for one government with three branches,&quot; Representative stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, frustration being expressed by the public and the media against the government for its apparent slow response to Ebola emergency are legitimate but not Representatives and Senators who are still signing for their fabulous salaries at the end of the month. The Montserrado County District #6 Representative also frowned on his colleagues who are vying for seats in the pending senatorial election by placing photos on buckets being provided to prevent the further spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Snowe: &quot;When I see people either a Representative or Senator or someone wanting to be Representative or senator or President going to print their pictures on buckets going to communities donating buckets and think that by criticizing the Executive Branch of Government make you more popular and that you are concerned about your people, I think it is irresponsible and is about time we put stop to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe in a rather offensive tune challenged his colleagues engaged in such irresponsible political relevance to use their access to the Presidency to advance workable strategy on how the fight against the virus is possible, and desist from taking the air waves to grandstand as if they love the people more than the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Union has called on its member states to urgently lift all travel bans imposed on countries affected by the Ebola outbreak in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AU has also called on member states to respect the principles of free movement and urged that any travel related measures should be in line with WHO and ICAO recommendations, which supports proper exit and entry screening procedures at airports, seaports and land crossings instead of travel bans and border closures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Foreign Ministry dispatch from Ethiopia, the AU at an emergency meeting of its Executive Council on the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak held in Addis Ababa, Tuesday, September 8, 2014, also decided to take all necessary steps for the rapid establishment of an African Center for Disease Control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AU encourages ongoing scientific researches on the use of serums and vaccines. The AU said it is also working closely with member states, international and national organizations, African partners with a view to mobilize adequate resources to respond to the EVD crisis in the spirit of African solidarity and approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by the AU Executive Council followed earlier presentations made by the Foreign Ministers of the three worst Ebola affected countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his presentation, Liberia's Foreign Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan told African Foreign Ministers and Ministers of Health at the meeting that the continent runs the risk of creating a legacy of blanket stigmatization and unnecessary restrictions based on the action of some member states against countries currently affected by the Ebola Virus Disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Ngafuan said the action by these member states, if not urgently reconsidered would be tantamount to &quot;unwittingly writing a dangerous prescription for how countries on our continent should be treated whenever they get afflicted with any public health challenge in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is this grim possibility that we all, as African nations, must avoid by revisiting all measures that are not consistent with expert advice but only fly in the face of African solidarity and integration,&quot; the Liberian Foreign Minister stressed amidst applause from the delegates at the well-attended meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on members of the Executive Council not to allow what he called hysteria and paranoia to underpin reactions to this Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is even more heart-rending and ironical is that no country in Europe, Asia, the Americas, or elsewhere has done to us what some of our fellow African countries have done to us&quot;, Foreign Minister Ngafuan passionately noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lifted praises to African countries and members of the international community including some African countries that have contributed cash and kind to assist our fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among African countries deserving special mention are the Federal Republic of Nigeria for committing US$500,000 to assist our fight; the Democratic Republic of Congo for recently deploying a six-member medical assessment team to Liberia in advance of the deployment of a larger group of medical experts to Liberia; the Republic of Ghana for committing to assist in airlifting critically needed humanitarian supplies to the worst affected countries; and the Kingdom of Morrocco for maintaining flights of its national carrier, the Royal Air Maroc, to and from Monrovia,&quot; he remarked in gratitude while also recognizing SN Brussels of Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking during the AU Executive Council meeting, the UN Under-Secretary General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission of Africa Carlos Lopes called on African countries putting in place draconian measures that are not medically justified against Ebola affected to think of themselves being under the same measures in a not so distant future as the virus have the potential to spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ebola can only be tackled through massive investment to address on an urgent basis the contributing factors to the outbreak. &quot;Countries in the epicenter are over-stretched and they need the whole of Africa to put a stop to misinformation and a call for action for a substantial funding of the outbreak control measures&quot;, Mr. Lopes stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma called on AU member nations to ensure Ebola does not spread to other countries, by implementing effective procedures to detect, isolate and treat those who may be infected and protect the rest of the populations from infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She at the same time called on member states to be careful not to introduce measures that place more averse social and economic impacts than the disease itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AU Chairperson said the commission welcomes the work of the WHO to speed up efforts on treatments and vaccines to halt the spread of Ebola while calling on the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies on the continent, in the Diaspora and elsewhere to work together, even in the absence of a business case for developing treatment and a vaccine for Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">623 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Citizens Alliance to Stop Ebola (CASE) - Liberia says the time is over for Liberian civil society actors to sit on the fence and see the government engaging the process of ridding the country of Ebola while the people continue to die from the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CASE-Liberia is a newly formed alliance of more than 20 civil society organizations, aimed ay helping in the fight against the deadly pestilence that has plagued the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly formed Alliance noted that Liberia which was the last to be attacked by the virus has become the country with and alarming infection and death records far above first countries such as Guinea and Sierra Leone were earlier affected by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the launching of the Alliance which took place in Soniwein, Monrovia, Atty. Alfred Brownell, who delivered the keynote address reiterated observation of the Alliance that the prevalence rate of the Ebola virus in the country has been at a very alarming pace of increase which constitutes the daily threats the country and its people suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, CASE-Liberia's coordinator Attorney-At-Law Alfred Brownell in announcing the launch of the Alliance over the weekend promised that CASE-Liberia will bring to the fight against Ebola new faces, including political actors, professionals and civil society groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also expected to bring to the fight are educators, marketers, youths and women's groupings, according to Atty. Brownell, saying that these united efforts will lead to a public awareness campaign in communities so as to make citizens regain trust in the government to accept the reality of the existing of the Ebola virus in the country and eschew denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because the failure of government to surmount the challenges posed by the virus demonstrates the government's inability to handle the outbreak alone unless every Liberian and partner rise to the challenge. Therefore, Brownell indicated that the organization was joining the fight against the deadly Ebola virus which he indicated has put Liberia under a serious threat that requires an &quot;all hands on desk&quot; action to actively respond to it from a united front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola pandemic in Liberia, Atty. Brownell said, has gone beyond government's capacity and that of those who have come to help the country, saying that such demonstrates that the government alone can no longer handle the plague which exposes Liberians and foreigners in the country to living in fear of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak in March, Atty. Brownell indicated, the government has made some tremendous efforts that has not heeded fruition, a situation which, according to the CASE-Liberia coordinator needs more engagements that would erase the difficulties and lead a positive responsive action that would bring the disease under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CASE-Liberia coordinator, said member organizations of the alliance were joining in the fight to strongly advocate against the spread of the disease and engaged in activities that will serve the useful interest of Liberia and its international partners who are themselves are engaged to eliminate the virus from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, he maintained, needs more assistance from the international community and friendly nations to help Liberia fight against the Ebola virus to save the country from the daily alarming death toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CASE-Liberia executive indicated that the organization will amongst other things demand of the international community the require funding the World Health Organization (WHO) is asking for to help respond to the Ebola virus in Liberia. CASE-Liberia, he further said, has already developed the new approach in providing public education for people to understand and accept the facts and the reality of the virus in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of the Bong County Legislative on Saturday, September 6, 2014 presented over sixty bags of rice, cooking utensils, buckets and several disinfectants, including chlorine and chloride to hard hit Ebola Communities in Salala and Jorquelleh districts. The communities include Balaketehla in Salala District, civil compound and Millionaire quarter in Gbarnga.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation, Senator Henry Yallah said his visit to the communities was intended to ascertain the general condition of the people since the Ebola virus outbreak. According to health authorities, Balaketehla in Salala District has recorded over thirty two suspected and confirmed Ebola deaths since the outbreak Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the visit, residents of the town told Senator Yallah though the county Ebola task force has been providing them some food items; they have no access to health services and there is no immediate response to pick up dead bodies from the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sixty five year, Oldman Singbeh Juah told the visiting delegation, since the outbreak, he has buried twenty one Ebola victims blaming his involvement in the failure of the Bong County Ebola Response Burial team to collect the dead body from the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people complained of rejection by health care providers in the district and appealed to government to establish a mobile health center in the town. The residents told Senator Henry Yallah and Salala District Representative Adam Bill Corneh, who was also part of the team to the town because of the situation, they had planned to break the quarantined and engage in demonstration to call government attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said since the town was quarantined pregnant women and children continue to die in the area. But Senator Yallah extended condolences to the residents and appealed to them to disengage their planned demonstration. He promised to take their concerns to the executive branch of government that is spearheading the fight against the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bong County Lawmaker said the legislature continues to provide financial and moral support to the executive to ensure the county task forces are prepared in response to the outbreak. Senator Yallah observed that the quarantined communities are above the capacity of the response mechanism and recommended that affected household be quarantined instead of the entire community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that if the task forces are not adequately prepared to cater to communities that are entirely declared quarantined, such action might undermine the fight to contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Yallah pleaded with the residents to remain calm as the county leadership was doing everything in its power to ensure that their concerns are adequately addressed and was swift to inform the town people that the donation was his own way of identifying with them amidst the health emergency in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montserrado County District #13 Representatives, Saah Joseph, says the government of Liberia through his office has purchased additional four ambulances, including one air Ambulance due to arrive very soon in the country. The Ambulances, the representative said, have been acquired to support the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawmaker made the disclosure during the weekend when he speaks with reporters at his district head office. He reveals that the only way to surmount challenges posed to the country by the outbreak of the deadly virus in the country is to provide more medical equipment and viable ambulance transportation services to render the response team more effective to respond to calls on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker disclosed that the air ambulance will be used for cases from Lofa and other parts of the country that are highly affected by the virus. Hon. Joseph said the Air ambulance will help to reduce the risk of traveling with people that has contracted the virus to treatment centers around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Air Ambulance will also be used in the leeward counties for pregnant women who will be unable to give birth easily and also to pick-up accident victim from accident scenes to the hospitals,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lawmaker then calls on the citizens to help buttress the efforts by the government in fighting this deadly virus by reporting cases in their communities as fast as possible before it spreads to other residents in that community. He also calls on well-meaning Liberians living in the USA and other part of the world to help the government in fighting the battle against the deadly pestilence that is characterized by uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Hon. Joseph also urged the Ebola Taskforce to respond to calls of citizens from various communities in order to help eradicate the deadly Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the disclosure at the regular task force meeting Monday, September 8, 2014, Bong County health officer Dr. Samson R. Arzuaquoi said, he has received assurances from Save the Children that all was now set to dedicate the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center, which is located 2 miles away from the Suakoko Leprosy Center has the capacity of fifty rooms and other facilities. According to Dr. Arzuaquoi, twenty two of the rooms are for suspected cases, while the remaining twenty eight will be used for confirming cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the children has put the estimated cost of the construction and materials, including beds among others at more than one hundred thousand US dollars.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday several members of the Redemption Hospital Workers' Association striked due to the nonchalant attitude towards their plight by the administration in lieu of the prevailing Ebola crisis that the country is now faced with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Hospital Workers' Association Vice President, Samuel F. Faley, said lots of health workers have died and are still dying from the deadly Ebola virus, and if they, front liners continue to die, definitely the virus will take over the entire country because there will be no one to fight it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Faley added that they are risking their lives but not benefiting anything in return and do not have fixed salary while some of them have worked for years but are not on government payroll. &quot;We are peaceful and professional people; we should be treated as we are and not the way you want,&quot; he asserted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that they have written several letters to the office of the Redemption Hospital General Administrator, Dominic Rennie, but there are still no positive steps being taken by the current administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Faley said, &quot;It is true that lots of donations are coming into the country to combat the Ebola virus but we at Redemption are not fully protected and the poor service of the administration has led to the death of some of our colleagues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that some insufficient protective gears and 50 bags of rice were given to the hospital for the workers but they (workers) have not received any of the rice. &quot;We were told that two persons should use one material which of course we all know the Ebola virus can be contacted by such means. Yet and still we have been told that two persons should use one boot&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Faley said that there has not been any risk benefit for them (workers) including what President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf said has not yet reached them. He said Redemption staffs are leaving the hospital to work with MSF because of not being paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned that some of the staff that left have been chased and threatened with dismissal. &quot;People working with MFS are fighting Ebola and they are treating Liberians to assist in making the country Ebola free so why should those that left be chased and threaten?&quot; the Rev. asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Faley said one of their colleagues named Joshua Peters died recently while trying to save lives and still the administration has not done anything about it. &quot;They are only up to stealing what was given for us. If we are satisfied we will not complain but if we are not satisfied we will complain,&quot; he intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, they want to know if the Redemption Hospital is a main Ebola center so they can know where and how to work, and there are new people from West Point that they do not know are working at the hospital and are paid but others who have been there for years are not paid,&quot; he concluded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the letter written by the administration dated September 1, 2014, &quot;management is equally of the opinion that people providing health services during these critical times need to be given special incentives. We will work diligently with the requisite authorities to ensure that President Sirleaf's special package is delivered as soon as possible. Protective gears and training are provided for all staff at Redemption during this critical period. In the case where a staff feels unsafe to carry out his/her duty, the staff should contact his/her supervisor who is directly responsible to liaise with Administration to ensure that Protective Equipment is available&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Money apportioned to a person or group of people depends on the role, responsibility or function of that group or person identified. We can assure you that management is cognizant of the basic policies and guidelines that warrant such decision,&quot; the letter stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also stated that &quot;We appreciate the Redemption Hospital Worker's Association assistance in every way. However we would like to remind you that all staffs are represented within the management structure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Government continues strives to contain the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in the County, C.H. Rennie Hospital in Margibi County is now reopened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reopening ceremony was held in the Conference Hall of the Hospital on Wednesday, September 3, 2014 in Kakata.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this paper during the reopening, the Medical Director of the Hospital, Dr. Magnus Asinya, acknowledged that in June 2014, the Hospital recorded the first Ebola case involving a student from the Kakata Rural Teachers Training Institute (KRTTI), something he said all nurses that attended to the patient were placed under 2-21 days Surveillance until declared negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Asinya lauded the county's Administration including the Margibi Legislative Caucus, for their concern and support to the county's Health Team, which has led to the reopening of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also making remarks, the Community Health Director, Mr. Joseph Korhene, placed the current death rate in the county since the outbreak in the county to 123, from June to September 3, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the county has recorded 192 cases with 38 confirmed, seventy-six suspected and seventy- nine probable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated further that out of the confirmed cases, 27 have died, forty-five have died out of the seventy-six suspected cases and fifty- one reported to have died out of the probable cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the Chairman of the Margibi Legislative Caucus, Rep. James Emmanuel Nuquqy, expressed disappointment over the alarming death rate in the county and maintained that the county's Legislative Caucus had been working with Health Authorities to ensure that the Ebola situation in the county is adequately addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Nuquay also used the occasion to extend condolences to the bereaved Families; especially families of health workers, something he disclosed that the County Administration was arranging special packages as motivation for health workers in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the ceremony, the Supt. of Margibi County and head of the Margibi Taskforce, Supt. John Z. Buway thanked the county Health Team for the level of performance over the past months against the fight of the deadly Ebola virus in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said with the reopening of the only Government referral hospital in the county, the spread of the virus will reduce and the high death toll will diminish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supt. Buway added that the local Administration is packaging a special token of appreciation for county Health Workers in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, a Physician Assistant at the C. H. Rennie Hospital and a survivor from the deadly Ebola virus, Mrs. Kyndy Kobbah, told the county Health Team and the county leadership that her infection, isolation and subsequent full recovery from the silent killer disease was not the end of the road in her medical service and that she will continue to work for the people of Margibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Kobbah in tears said though she had gone through all the pains, agony and isolation as the result of the disease, she will continue to provide service to the people even in these difficult times and will use her status as a survivor to educate those that are of the notion that the disease does not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile she has recommended to the Government of Liberia to at less have Ebola Treatment Centers in all of the counties in Liberia, something she said will help to stop the death rate in the county and the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Country Director of Plan Liberia, Mr. Oumarou Koala, said the donation was intended to buttress the effort of Government of Liberia in fighting the deadly Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Koala disclosed that since the Ebola outbreak in the country, Plan Liberia has been working with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and its decentralized entity in Lofa to fight Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have done various contributions including awareness on Ebola through community radio in Lofa County, and we donated megaphones, posters, brochures and washing facilities to many schools and health workers and volunteers training in Lofa and some support for communication and logistics in Lofa County. Plan Liberia has extended the Ebola response programs to Bomi and Montserrado in addition to Lofa and carried on some involvement in the fight of the deadly Ebola virus including giving logistics to the social mobilization team,&quot; Kolan stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, Plan International as child centered International Organization is committed to support children and their family health and welfare. &quot;We have developed and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Health and the MOU guides our interventions in the health domain making sure that our support is always embedded in the national priorities, policies and strategies,&quot; Mr. Koala explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Koala told journalists that items donated to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare were worth US$84,000.&quot;We hope that this support will particularly improve in three counties where the Ebola patients being transferred to the ETU and Ebola dead bodies will be removed for burial, those components being part of critical actions to undertake to break the chain of transmission that contains the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Deputy Minister for Administration at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Matthew T.K. Flomo, has lauded Plan Liberia for the significant contribution made to the Ministry and that the donation will be used for the intended purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">698 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Liberia in March 2014, the government and people have found themselves under attack from a strange disease that has been described as &quot;deadlier than the 15 years of civil war.&quot; Liberia is in effect at war with an &quot;enemy&quot; that spares no one in a war whose frontlines can be anywhere including homes, relatives, hospitals, and taxi cabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sean Devereux Children's Education and Agriculture Program (SDCEP) - a child/youth development organization based in Bomi and Montserrado Counties - realized that Ebola was spreading faster and affecting many including children and elderly. SDCEP staff and volunteers immediately decided to undertake awareness-raising exercises in communities to inform people about the dangers of the EVD and how it can be prevented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was very essential because the virus was spreading among people mainly due to denial, traditional burial rituals, caring for the sick, and other forms of contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a vigorous awareness effort in the Brewerville area was required to change minds and attitude. They organized themselves into a group called the &quot;Sean Devereux Brewerville Anti-Ebola Awareness Team (SDBEAT).&quot; They contacted the Driverseat Initiatives (a local group that supports/trains community people to become drivers of their own initiatives) to train the Sean Devereux team members. Headed by Mrs Thelma Dahn-Debra, this group works with the MoH and comprises people working in the UN, NGO, and private sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Driverseat Initiatives sent a team of trainers to the Sean Devereux school on August 7th and conducted a three hour intensive training in community entry, sensitization, and information-sharing techniques. They provided posters and flyers and the SDBEAT volunteers were strongly advised to stick to the messages on the posters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next day, SDBEAT met and divided themselves into six groups of people assigned in six communities within the Brewerville area. The communities included Jah Tondo, VOA Junction, Perry Town, Blamasee, Old Don Bosco Junction, Baby Ma Junction Right, Baby Ma Junction Left including Kpallah Town. They then adopted the door-to-door visit method. They were amazed at the overwhelming support from the community people including area chiefs/leaders who either volunteered or nominated people to join them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SDBEAT thereupon combined efforts with the local people and their Representative of Montserrado County District #17 William Dakel and succeeded in getting an ambulance to rescue five members of one family, including a grandmother, her son, and four grandchildren, to the ELWA isolation center, because they were sick and suspected of having Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Kpallah training session, SDBEAT was informed that a group of people of Duala wanted training assistance. Driverseat Initiatives agreed to come. That training in Duala was held August 15th, and it turned out to be the biggest gathering to date with nearly 200 people signing up, comprising about 80% women. One participant stood up and said: &quot;Ebola is a very smart and clever disease that wants to destroy us all. To do this, Ebola first kills those who are to protect us - the doctors and nurses - before turning on us. We must fight this disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With capacity building support of the Driverseat Initiave, SDBEAT has organized awareness-raising training in Brewerville, Duala (Sarnor Yard), Amadu/Folley Town in Bomi County, Battery Factory in Gardnersville, and Soul Clinic communities. Trained community people have gone from door to door to spread the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SDBEAT sees the fight against Ebola as a big national fight for all Liberians. SDCEP has received financial support from the Sean Devereux Children's Fund UK and Mrs. Susan Khan and family in USA. The good news is that many people in our target communities are responding well to campaign messages and using the hand washing kits, and spreading the messages, although Ebola is still very much around. SDBEAT says it continues to face poster, flyer, transportation, and financial constraints. Volunteers are up to the task and will continue to collaborate with all partners and government to ensure that Liberia is safe from Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent citizen of Bentol in Montserrado County, Richard R. Tolbert, has identified with the deadly Ebola virus by donating two Remote Sensing Thermometers and several buckets, including chlorine, bleaches and soap, to help curb the disease which has taken away several lives in the country so far.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tolbert expressed with heavy heart damages being caused by the Ebola virus and according to him, the effort of fighting the virus remains everyone's concern. He however called on the citizens to take seriously those preventive measures outlined by the Health Ministry and International partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further hailed the leadership of Bentol for at least embarking upon massive awareness to sensitize the citizenry on preventing the Ebola, the watching of hands, avoiding body contacts, and those issues that help increase the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items, Deacon Humphrey Van Pett of Bentol City lauded Mr. Tolbert for the donation and promised to convey the kind gesture to the many citizens of the area. According to him, this was one of the first time for a citizen of Bentol to think about them and donate those items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, during a visit to the Low Cost Village along the Todee Road recently where some deaths were reported to have occurred, the citizens, in a letter addressed to Hon. Tolbert noted seriously the urgent need for emergency supports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that meeting, the Town Chief, Jebbeh Mulbah informed the citizens that they were at least 3,500 residents in the community residing in 93 homes. According to him, in one of the housing units, a man identified as Kesselly, relocated to 15 Gate in Harbel, where he lived for few months and returned, leaving his daughter behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, his daughter returned but very ill, and the family immediately reported that the girl (his daughter) had &quot;jaundice&quot; and she was cared for in the house but when her condition worsened, they attempted transporting her to the Bentol Hospital when she died at the gate of the Hospital in Bentol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, ten days later, both the father and mother of the deceased grew very ill and also expired in their home and were later taken away after 26 days by health workers, leaving behind two male children, a 16-year old and a 4 year old who are currently surviving back home through fellow villagers. Fortunately, a medical Doctor Quayee made daily visits to the area to treat the two children, and carefully monitoring them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The village is currently self-quarantined by the villagers but the need for food and basic preventive measures still remain a serious problem. The materials were given with the assistance of Putu Mining Company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An oil company operating in the country has contributed US$150,000 grant to the Liberia National Red Cross Society to enable the society intensify the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, ExxonMobil provided the Liberian chapter of the International Red Cross the US$150,000 grant to fund Ebola public health efforts in Liberia. Ebola has so far engulfed thirteen of Liberia's fifteen counties with Montserrado and Bomi counties recording the highest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian National Red Cross Society is working with the Liberian Ministry of Health to fight the Ebola outbreak with programs that raise local awareness about how to prevent spreading the virus, provide contact tracing, support psycho-social counseling and distribute survival kits to Ebola victims' families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ExxonMobil is relatively new to Liberia, but we know how important public health is to every community,&quot; said Nathaniel Jallah, ExxonMobil's Public Affairs and Government Manager in Liberia. &quot;We support the Red Cross, other international aid organizations and the government in their efforts to eradicate Ebola in Liberia,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jallah disclosed that ExxonMobil also provided a $75,000 grant in April to Plan International to support local public health efforts soon after the Ebola virus was detected in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the US$150,000 check, the Secretary General of the Liberia National Red Cross, Fayiah Tamba lauded ExxonMobil for the grant describing it as a giant step in fighting the Ebola epidemic. Mr. Tamba said the Liberia National Red Cross is engaged in five most cardinal areas in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named the areas as social mobilization, creating awareness in the various counties where 875 volunteers have been deployed to carry on awareness campaign on Ebola. He also said the LNRC is providing support on contact tracing, helping to ensure that those suspected of having the Ebola virus are followed for twenty-one days, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tamba added that Red Cross is also providing psycho-social support and food distribution to various communities. He said with support from the World Food Program, they provided food items to 30,000 inhabitants to residents of West Point and Dolo's Town that were recently quarantined by Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, the National Task Force Coordinator, Dobor Jallah reminded organizations and groups receiving funding on the fight against Ebola that they will give account to government on how money and items received are expended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jallah said organizations receiving funding are under obligation to utilize the funds as they will be made to account for what is being received to government through the National Task Force and the General Auditing Commission (GAC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ExxonMobil holds 83 percent interest in Liberia Block 13 (LB-13), comprising more than 625,000 acres (2,500 square kilometers) offshore Liberia in water depths ranging from 250 to 10,000 feet (75 to 3,000 meters). ExxonMobil is the operator of LB-13.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to statement by Information Minister Lewis Brown that the Oniyama Specialist Hospital (known as Island Clinic) on the Bushrod Island would have become functional this week, information gathered shows that the facility is yet to be completed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clinic, when completed, according to Minister Brown will be used as Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU). The center is expected to ease the capacity constraints being faced at the ELWA and other Ebola treatment units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola patients, including those suspected and confirmed are being rejected at the ELWA and other treatment units due to the lack of space. The Island Clinic was among other centers assured by the government through the Information Minister to have been opened this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola Case Management Consultant, Dr. Atai Omoruto said the facility might be completed next week. Speaking to a team of LMC/IREX journalists during a tour of the hospital's facilities Monday, Dr. Omoruto said the center will need at least 200 health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruto also heads a team of Ugandan doctors who are expected to operate the Oniyama Specialist Hospital Ebola Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the completion of the 150 beds center and other facilities earmarked by the government and partners are expected to ease the problem of space for suspected and confirmed Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, the Chairman of the Island Clinic Community Jerry Williams welcomed the construction of the center in their area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said community members also reached an agreement with the government to help the community with electricity, reconditioning of the road leading to the clinic, employment of community members, among others. Writes, Sam Zota, Jr.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy has embarked on an Ebola awareness campaign to sensitize miners and citizens about the killer disease which has reportedly killed over 1,000 people in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a high power delegation from the Ministry led by Minister Patrick Sendolo visited Jungle James Mining Camp in Gbarpolu County to educate the people about the danger Ebola poses to their survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy is interested in the health and safety of people in the mining sector for which it decided to embark on the awareness campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Sendolo told the people that government appreciates their contributions to the development of Liberia, and called on the people to continue contributing toward the growth of their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is important for people in the mining sector to adhere to the preventive measures by health workers so as to avoid the outbreak of Ebola in the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Sendolo warned that if they do not adhere to the preventive measures, it will be catastrophic should the virus surfaces in the mining sector considering the over crowdedness of mining camps across Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the people in Jungle James Mining Camp to monitor the movement of people in order to prevent the virus in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Sendolo presented over 50 buckets, cartoons of chloral and other anti-Ebola materials to the people in the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister also donated personal protective equipment to the health team of Gbarpolu County and several buckets and chloral to citizens of Weamah Town in Gbarpolu County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the Mining Chairman of the camp Vasayou Sheriff lauded the Ministry for identifying with them during this national health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prior to the visit of the Minister and his team, they have been creating awareness about the killer disease. Mr. Sheriff assured that the donated materials would be used purposefully.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">475 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian government has welcomed President Barack Obama's pronouncement that the U.S. military will help in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Minister Brownie Samukai, who is currently visiting the United States, said his visit is part of his government's effort to bring to the attention of the international community the scale of the Ebola virus and to solicit their support.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press television program, President Obama said U.S. military assets are needed to set up isolation units and equipment and provide security for international health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had discussions at the Department of Defense on the issues of utilizing and requesting the full skill of United States capabilities, both on the soft side and on the side of providing logistics and technical expertise... And, we as a country are extremely pleased with the announcement that we have heard, and we look forward to that cooperation as expeditiously as we can,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the VOA, Samukai said his visit to Washington included meetings with officials in the defense department and leaders of Congress. He did not give details about his visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ebola has brought Liberia's entire economy to a standstill, and his country's ability to respond to the crisis has been limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samukai said Obama's announcement indicates the U.S. has heard and heeded President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's plea for help, as well as the appeals of the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samukai said he and Liberia's Ambassador to the United Nations will represent President Sirleaf Tuesday at the UN when the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Coordinator of UN Operations in Liberia will report to the Security Council on the mandate of the UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia, which expired last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say that, given the current health crisis brought on by Ebola, Special Representative Karin Landgren's report might focus on the Ebola crisis instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, President Sirleaf authorized the defense ministry to set up a board of inquiry to look into the Ebola-related rioting and deadly shooting in the West Point slum of the capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She gave the Defense Ministry 10 days to submit its findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had quarantined West Point as part of an effort to contain the deadly Ebola virus. Soldiers opened fire and used tear gas to break-up a protest who had opposed the quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person, a 16-year old boy, Sheki Kamara, died of bullet wounds. He was among four wounded during the clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Samukai had earlier told reporters that the 16-year-old boy was wounded as a result of barb wire. But protesters said the 16-year-old was shot. Following careful review of a video recording and photographs, Minister Samukai conceded that that lethal force was used.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama says the international community needs to respond to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, where he indicated that lack of public health infrastructure has led to the spread of a &quot;containable problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama told the American television network, NBC News that U.S. military assets are needed to set up isolation units and equipment and to provide security for international health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates, it becomes more easily transmittable,&quot; said Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to VOA news, President Obama believes that the United States needs to make dealing with the Ebola outbreak a national security priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the VOA reports that a new study show that an experimental Ebola vaccine, which is being tested on monkeys, can work for five weeks or up to 10 months if used in conjunction with a booster shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a study published Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) say the experimental vaccine regimen produced durable immunity against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers say a single dose of the vaccine protected all four test monkeys when exposed to Ebola five weeks later. They said half were protected when exposed to the virus 10 months after vaccination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in tests on a separate group of monkeys, scientists say a booster shot, given two months after the initial vaccination, extended protection for all vaccinated monkeys for up to 10 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccine tested by the NIH is similar to one being developed by drug maker GlaxoSmithKline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven companies operating in Liberia and other West African countries have welcomed the pronouncement by U.S. President Barack Obama that the U.S. military will help in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press television program, President Obama said the U.S. military assets are needed to set up isolation units and equipment and provide security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the companies said they are understandably concerned about the impact of the Ebola virus on affected countries' economies and the well-being of their people, which is being compounded by subsequent decisions and actions that affect travel to and trade with the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued Monday September 8, the companies said they have made long term commitments to these countries and their people and that they intend to honor these commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have strong ties to hundreds of local communities that depend on our operations. Despite the challenging environment, we are continuing where possible with normal operations, with the health and safety of our employees being the absolute priority at all times,&quot; the companies said in the statement signed by eleven CEOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEOs who signed the statement include African Mining Services John Kavanagh, General Manager for African Operations; ArcelorMittal Lakshmi Mittal, Chairman and CEO, Aureus Mining Inc David Reading, CEO Dawnus Group; Bob Jones, Managing Director Golden Veroleum Liberia; David Rothschild, Director Hummingbird Resources Plc, Dan Betts, CEO IAMGOLD Corporation, and Stephen J.J. Letwin, President and CEO London Mining Plc. Other are Graeme Hossie, CEO MonuRent; Tony Carr, CEO Newmont Mining Corporation; Gary Goldberg, President and CEO Randgold Mark Bristow, CEO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eleven companies urge the international community to pool its resources and lend support to help reverse the virus and enable these countries to recover as swiftly as possible from dealing with the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They indicated that Saturday's declaration by President Obama concerning US military support in the region is exactly the type of action that is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have enormous respect for the organizations and selfless individuals working to contain this outbreak and are committed to support them and the governments concerned to bring the epidemic to an end. As a group we are in regular dialogue with governments, NGOs and other task forces involved to support their work,&quot; the companies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies also acknowledge the larger coordinated global effort that is required to fight the ebola virus. They said that the global community has a strong track record in responding to natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes, emphasizing &quot;we need a similar strength of resolve to tackle an epidemic that has the potential to cause great harm to this region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We therefore urge the international community to pool its resources and lend support to help reverse the virus and enable these countries to recover as swiftly as possible from dealing with the epidemic. Yesterday's declaration by President Obama concerning US military support in the region is exactly the type of action that is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted that there is a risk the measures being taken to restrict travel to the countries most impacted by the virus will aggravate the growing humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is without doubt a horrific virus. But it is a virus that with the right understanding, precautions and processes in place should be avoidable and containable. That's why we are calling for the immediate opening of humanitarian and economic corridors to the affected countries and urge the international community to respect the ECOWAS call to lift any travel bans in accordance with the WHO recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two diseases intersect in the west African epidemic, whose frightening scale is only just beginning to be fully grasped. One is Ebola itself. The other is the wasting away of the very organisation tasked to fight such illnesses. While Ebola was incubating away in the animal population of the Guinea forest over the years, something akin to muscular dystrophy was eroding the tissue, bone and nervous systems of the main international body set up to lead the response to epidemics, the World Health Organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name evokes a picture of expert staff constantly conferring in Geneva on a stream of reports sent in by their people all over the world in order to identify epidemic threats at their inception, then despatching teams of doctors and other specialists, organising the shipment of drugs and equipment, providing resources when affected countries cannot cope on their own, and advising on the international precautions that ought to be adopted. That was true in the past, when WHO played a leading part in containing the Ebola outbreak in Zaire in 1976, and the Sars virus in east Asia in 2003, but it is sadly not true today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A devastating report in the New York Times shows that WHO has been savagely run down in recent years, with the most eviscerating cuts made in the very departments vital for the containment of epidemics. One department was closed down entirely, another key section had its staff cut by two-thirds, and staff in the field, especially in Africa, were similarly reduced. The reasons were both financial and ideological. Countries cut contributions to WHO after the financial crisis and, at the same time, the idea took hold that the organisation should concentrate its efforts on helping nations build their own capacity to respond to emergencies rather than providing that capacity itself in the first instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was theoretically reasonable, but did not happen in practice, especially in poorer parts of the world. The result was that WHO simply walked away from the lessons of its own successes, stripping itself of the means to act effectively when Ebola emerged again. Tellingly, the disease spread for three months before it was spotted, and it was an NGO, Medecins sans Frontieres, that first categorised it as a major outbreak. The head of MSF, Dr Joanne Liu, told the UN last week that the battle to contain Ebola was being lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weak health systems of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, she implied, have become centres for the spread of Ebola rather than its control, as carers fall ill and patients flee. Dr Liu called on wealthy countries to send military biohazard teams to west Africa, a measure worth immediate consideration. Beyond that, there must be a resolve never to let the WHO fall into such an eroded state again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes for an effective Ebola vaccine have been raised after trials of an experimental vaccine found that it gave monkeys long-term protection from the killer disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animals that received a first shot and a booster two months later were immune to the infection for 10 months, according to US government researchers. If further trials show that the vaccine works safely in humans, it could be used to protect health workers and contain future outbreaks by immunising villagers living next to affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings will encourage scientists in Britain and elsewhere who have just begun human trials of an Ebola vaccine in the hope of preventing another outbreak of the virus. The World Health Organisation said last week that the total death toll in African states could reach 20,000 before it is brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers led by Nancy Sullivan at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland tested two vaccines on macaques. The first was based on a harmless monkey virus which had been modified to carry a protein from the Zaire strain of Ebola. A single shot protected the animals for several weeks. The same vaccine, developed by the NIH and GlaxoSmithKline, has just gone into human clinical trials in Britain, Mali and the Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US researchers went on to test a second vaccine based on a modified cowpox virus. Monkeys that received the vaccine as a booster two months after the first vaccine were protected against lethal doses of Ebola for a full 10 months, according to a report in Nature Medicine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several persons in the Studio Junction in the ELWA Community have feared that the deadly Ebola Virus may spread in the area if no preventive measures are put in place to curtail what seems to be an embarrassing situation that erupted in the area over the weekend. The residents speaking to this paper said Thursday night explained how an ambulance conveying several persons suspected of the deadly Ebola virus dropped them right at the entrance of the ELWA Studio Junction isolation center and immediately left the scene, leaving the suspected persons, some of whom appeared sick and helpless to sleep in the open.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the residents, Sarah Browne, told this paper that some of the suspects managed to enter the community where they slept on other people's porches thereby creating panic for the residents adding, &quot;We are living in fear of this virus, from the onset; we told the government that the building of this center will create serious health problem for us and no one listened to us, now, here we are, facing this situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the residents are calling on the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to ensure their security or remove the center from the area to prevent health crisis in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Studio Junction Community is situated in District Six, with Representative Edwin M. Snowe as their lawmaker and is host to more than fifteen thousand residents, basically women, men and children. The vast majority of the residents live on a daily hustle, crushing rocks for daily sale to feed their families. The center has a maximum capacity for 50 persons at a time, but is now hosting more than the number due to the influx of patients flowing at the center to seek medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, at the World Health Organization's (WHO) isolation center at the John F. Kennedy Medical Hospital, 11 patients were released and certificated declaring them Ebola free on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patients who were suffering from the Ebola virus were given assorted items by WHO to enable them start at fresh. Relatives and friends were seen rejoicing for their family members who have survived the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, some individuals who are suspected of coming in contact with the Ebola virus were seen at the entrance of the WHO isolated center pleading with one of the doctors to be admitted. They were told that there was no space at the center, that all the beds in the center were occupied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors later agreed to admit the suspected Ebola patients in to the isolated center, but when the patients were about to enter the isolated center, they were prevented by health workers from entering the center because they (workers) have not received their wages for the month of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health workers who complained to WHO Representative said they have worked very hard to save lives and have not been paid but the WHO Representative pleaded with the workers and promised to intervene into the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) has written the Minister of Justice, Cllr. Christina Tah, raising issues of several attacks, harassments and intimidation against the Liberian media. In its letter, the PUL said, &quot;We are increasingly concerned about the rapid deterioration in fundamental freedoms in Liberia upon the action and or inaction of government actors. This runs contrary to the constitutional obligations to protect these rights.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Union said it recognizes the nature of the health emergency in our country and respects the number of measures that have been taken to address them, both by government, as well as local, civic and international development partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the union believes that &quot;nothing under the circumstances created by this emergency shall be used as an alibi to undermine the rights and freedoms of Liberians, especially and including journalists, lest to mention the obligation of the government to ensure that all Liberians have full guarantees of these rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strategically, the Press Union of Liberia has insisted upon its membership in the National Ebola Task Force, though the role of the Task Force has itself been merely a forum for the sharing of information from organs that are implementing activities. This participation continues to inspire journalists, media institutions and civil society organizations that this is a national obligation that should involve all persons,&quot; the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, the Union pointed out that its attention is specifically drawn to several circumstances that do not only restrain journalists in their obligation to seek out and share useful news and information with the public, but significantly threaten even media participation in the global fight against ebola. By all accounts, the media space in Liberia has been a significant partner in the fight to strengthen awareness in our society about the impact and challenges of the epidemic. Notwithstanding the loss of revenue due to the emergency nature of the epidemic and the effect on general life, the media has remained committed to this fight, &quot;the letter said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone, one of the countries worst hit by West Africa's Ebola outbreak - has announced a three-day lockdown to try to tackle the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 19 to 21 September people will not be allowed to leave their homes, a senior official said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the move is to allow health workers to isolate new cases to prevent the disease from spreading further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak has killed about 2,100 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Friday that health workers could be given vaccines as from November, when safety tests are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 health workers have lost their lives to the virus in Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone officials said more than 20,000 people would be deployed to make sure residents stayed indoors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SidieYahya Tunis, the health ministry's communications director, told the BBC: &quot;We don't expect them to refuse. You follow or else you'll be breaking the law. If you disobey then you are disobeying the president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC's West Africa correspondent, Thomas Fessy in Senegal, says the Sierra Leone population's willingness to obey will be key for the plan to succeed - a forcible implementation is likely to raise human rights issues and could potentially spark violent demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Liberia sealed off a large slum in the capital, Monrovia, for more than a week in an attempt to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Nigeria have meanwhile decided to reopen schools in the country from 22 September. They were closed as a precaution to prevent the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a US doctor infected with Ebola is being treated in a Nebraska hospital after evacuation from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Sacra, 51, was described as sick but stable. He is the third American aid worker infected. The other two recovered after treatment in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the WHO announced that the blood of patients who recovered from Ebola should be used to treat others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People produce antibodies in the blood in an attempt to fight off an Ebola infection. The antibodies may be able to help a sick patient's immune system if they are transferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, large scale data on the effectiveness of the therapy is lacking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1412 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is over two weeks since the government of Liberia shut down the National Chronicle Newspaper following the publication of a story of some Liberians in the Diaspora advocating for an interim government to replace the constitutional administration led by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The paper was closed down without any prior information about the government's intention to do so. However, it was gathered later that it was based on &quot;security reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In carrying out the action, the police officers who went to enforce the government's order caused unnecessary stir, as the situation spread to other areas of the suburbs of the city, especially Duala, New Kru Town and Redlight Market, indicating that there was shooting in Monrovia, apparently from the sound of the teargas that was reportedly used. That situation caused panic and apprehension, thus leading to the disruption of normal activities in those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly in the wake of concerns about the actual reasons for the government's action against this independent newspaper, the Deputy Minister of Information for Public Affairs, Atty Isaac Jackson, in an official communication to the Publisher and Managing Editor of the paper, Mr. Philipbert Browne, cited reasons why the paper was ordered closed down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his communication dated August 16, but released to the public last week, the Information Ministry said, &quot;The national security apparatus including the Liberia National Police has drawn the urgent attention of the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism to ongoing investigations necessitated by at least two publications of the National Chronicle Newspaper in which it is claimed that the democratic order and consolidation processes of the country are being torpedoed and reversed by means not provided for by the Liberian Constitution in the summary replacement of the administration of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf by a transitional administration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communication went on: &quot;The National Chronicle also claims that these unconstitutional maneuvers have the backing and support of a friendly government with which the Liberian government and people have long-standing and ongoing excellent relations. Subsequently, you have indicated on at least two radio stations including the national broadcaster and UNMIL Radio that you possess evidentiary support for these grave charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the Ministry said, &quot;Aware of the recent difficult history of our country, the security institutions are entreating these claims with the deserved level of seriousness, and have requested that the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism immediately suspend all further publications of the National Chronicle Newspaper to enable a thorough investigation. We feel compelled to oblige this request and to dutifully inform you that the publication of the National Chronicle Newspaper is hereby suspended pending the conclusion of these investigations which we have been assured will be conducted and concluded in the shortest possible time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its response to the ministry's communication through its Minister, Brown's communication, the Publisher and Managing Editor of the newspaper, Mr. Browne pointed out that recent publications in other media outlet on similar matter for which his newspaper has been closed and is facing investigation, has now vindicated his institution of any wrongdoing. Therefore, he has called on the Ministry to reopen the newspaper and also extend an apology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response among other things noted, &quot;Mr. Minister, now that the facts of the Chronicle's publications fill the pages of local dailies bi-and-tri-weekly, social media websites, and other international media vindicating the National Chronicle Newspaper of the charges contained in your letter, dated August 16, 2014, of any wrong-doing, the National Chronicle requests an open apology from the Government of Liberia for acting contrarily to the norms of a civilized state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expanding on his defense, Mr. Browne said, &quot;Mr. Minister, since the reason for the closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper is now a national debate with documentation filling the pages of the local media, social networks and international outlets, the National Chronicle Newspaper demands the immediate reopening of its office without precondition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Chronicle also demands that the Government of Liberia, under the leadership of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, addresses itself to the huge Constitutional violation of the National Chronicle as a corporate institution, registered under the laws of the Republic of Liberia; the mal-handling, flogging and incarceration of its Editorial Staff, who are all citizens, protected by the Constitution of the Republic of Liberia,&quot; the communication stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the paper, The National Chronicle is also requesting that an open apology be rendered by Atty. Isaac W. Jackson, Jr., Deputy Minister for Press and Public Affairs, for raining insults on both the publisher and the National Chronicle Newspaper on several local radio stations, terming the institution as a &quot;notorious extortionist&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, I take interest in this matter because it is over two weeks since the newspaper was shut down and its manager subject to investigation. Indisputably, it is now clear that the government's action was based on the publication of some Liberians in the Diaspora, calling for an interim government to be headed by Dr. James TeahTarpeh, as the story reported. Dr. Tarpeh, is Liberia's former Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after more than two weeks of investigation, the government by now should come out with its findings on the investigation, as the publisher and his lawyers have cooperated with the investigation team. Frankly, the continual delays on the part of the government to come out with its findings on the issue would definitely suggest something sinister, rather than for security reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My concern in recent times about issues relative to the media is based on the facts that one of the exploits of this administration is the level of press freedom and freedom of speech. And so to see a newspaper being closed in the wake of all of the accolades and encomiums that this government, as well as its leader, Madam Sirleaf, has received for these kinds of freedoms, then, there is reason for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should all know that freedom of speech and freedom of the press do not necessarily mean that we have to agree with all what people have to say, but we have to respect the constitutional rights to speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can be recalled that when Ebola started, one lawmaker said it was only intended to put money in some individuals' pockets, as there was no Ebola in Liberia. Likewise, another said that was a &quot;curse on the President.&quot; Also, there were calls to &quot;outsource the fight against the Ebola virus.&quot; I do not agree with these assertions, but I respect the rights of those individuals who said these at different intervals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, on the issue of freedom of the press one does not have to agree with all what is published or broadcast by the media, or all comments attributed to people; notwithstanding, the media must be allowed to function. This goes to say that one may not agree with the editorial judgment of a particular media institution on the selection of news stories on national issues, like in the case of some Liberians calling for interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the media is referred to as the marketplace for the exchange of ideas, it means that it serves as a platform to discuss issues, and so if some Liberians want to unconstitutionally breach or circumvent the rules regarding democratic governance, then a platform should equally be created for those who would not agree with this. This is cardinal in the promotion and protection of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately for this country, like many other countries, there is an Information Ministry that serves as the clearinghouse for government's information business and so if there is any publication or broadcast, he should be in the position to respond accordingly rather than taking such action as closing down a media institution, something that has a negative effect on the country regarding the freedom of the press and freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until this government realizes that much has been achieved regarding freedom of speech and freedom of the press that such action of closing down a newspaper is counter-productive. I REST MY CASE.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Women Development Association of Liberia (WODAL) over the weekend donated several Ebola materials to the ELWA government quarantine center. The donated materials include tissues, toothpastes, and tooth brushes for the affected people quarantine in the center.

She added that Ebola patients need to be well taken care of as to stop the spread of the virus in the country and encourage other philanthropic and patriot to assist in fight against this deadly disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jerry F. Brown received the items on behave of the hospital and lauded WODAL for their immense contribution. He added that many of the patients come in with absolutely nothing but, with your contribution at least those affected from the virus will feel at home while in quarantine center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINCE THE SECOND outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia, the country's health care system has suffered its greatest set-back in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS EVIDENCED of the facts that even the Government of Liberia (GOL) and its international partners have acknowledged that the Ebola crisis has overwhelmed the country's health care system. Indeed hospitals and health centers in the country, both private and public have been shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEEKS AFTER THE various hospitals were artificially shut down as a result of health workers abandoning their jobs for fear of being infected with the Ebola virus; the government started a good process by attempting to reopen the hospitals and health centers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE TIME, Information Minister Lewis G. Brown informed the public that Deputy Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Bernice Dahn was leading the campaign to have all hospitals and health centers reopen. He further said tons of medical supplies were distributed to all major hospitals and health centers throughout the country for the smooth operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOWEVER, SINCE DR. DAHN began that process and medicines and other medical supplies were said to be delivered to the various health centers and hospitals around the country, there still seems to be a problem with the Health Care system, as many persons are being continuously rejected at these hospitals or health centers without treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY leading to more deaths of persons suffering from other sicknesses such as malaria, and other common illnesses which sometimes lead to those ill persons giving up the ghost right in the presence of health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MORE ASTONISHING part of this is when the person dies, health workers are curious to examine them for Ebola, a situation which always takes days or hours to be completed only to the dismay of family members who feel that if medical attention was given their relative, they might have survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS DEVELOPMENT INDICATES that Health Care Workers(HCW) are still afraid of the deadly Ebola virus because they might get infected with the virus unknowingly while treating a patient as was the case with other health workers that had succumb to the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT THERE HAS been a solution to this problem evidenced of the numerous donations of disinfectants and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as well as other medical supplies from the United States, China and other partners in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUESTION NOW is where are these PPE and other medical supplies that were brought into the country. Were they distributed for the use of health workers or are they being supplied only to the Ebola treatment centers. Are we going to leave other illnesses untreated because of the fear of the Ebola virus?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THESE ARE THE unhealthy developments that are now leading us to advice that the PPE must be given to all Hospitals and Health Centers for the treatment of all. Since the health care worker does not know if a sick person is suffering from Ebola or not, these equipment must be supplied and used by the health workers to render some level of treatment that will indeed save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE GOVERNMENT AND her international partners must now see this epidemic as an opportunity to improve the country's health care system by building the capacity of the various hospitals and health centers as well as the well-being of health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDEED, BUILDING THE capacity of hospitals and health centers must now become a priority as this is cardinal to the fight against Ebola and the provision of good health system. By doing this, more lives will be saved and Ebola will soon be a history in Liberia's public health arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF THESE HOSPITALS and health centers are capacitated with the necessary medical supplies and PPE we can without delay eradicate Ebola, provide cure for other sicknesses and cut down the number of unprecedented deaths we have today.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid incessant national and international efforts to battle and crush world's latest daunting and deadly Ebola virus which has initially invaded three West African Countries, including Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and reportedly spreading across the Region, the Liberia Coca-Cola Bottling Company (LCCBC), has made an initial huge contribution in cash, water and anti-Ebola sanitizing materials, amongst others, as part of effort to eradicate the killer disease and help those who have already contracted the virus and undergoing treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LCCBC's Country Manager, Mr. Seth-Adu-Baah, said as corporate entity operating in Liberia, it was timely and absolutely necessary for the company to join the nation-wide campaign against the deadly virus in an effort to save precious lives which are under threat following the unprecedented outbreak of the virulent disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LCCBC which has made tremendous contribution to boost Liberia's health and education sectors and at the same time implementing a robust women economic empowerment program in conformity with its corporate social responsibility in Liberia, has refused to sit idle without making substantial attempt in the ongoing anti-Ebola campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in its initial attempt in the raging Ebola war, the Coca-Cola Industrial Plant has distributed 22,800 bottles of mineral water in some affected communities and health centers, including ELWA and JFK hospitals, Dolo Town, Margibi County, West Point, Montserrado County and Foya, Lofa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the company has provided 25 pieces of thermometers to few health centers and hospitals, including S.D Cooper Clinic, Benson Hospital, James Davis, Redemption, SOS and Dr. Swaray medical center in Paynesville, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others items distributed by the LCCBC include, 450 giant-size containers and buckets to help in the fight against the alarming deadly plague which has kept the nation in perpetual terror since its outbreak few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has also disclosed that it has already deposited US$2,000.00 cash into the anti-Ebola Trust Fund at the Central Bank of Liberia, adding that total amount spent in the entire process is put at over US$13,500.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, authorities of the Company have revealed that two containers of anti-Ebola materials donated by global Coca-Cola Company are expected to arrive in Liberia by the end of the Month, although the company vowed that it would not rest until the virus is totally defeated in the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General Daniel D. Ziankhan, Jr., Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), for the first time, led a high-power Joint Security Task Force (JTF) assessment tour to Rivercess, Margibi, Bomi and Grand Cape Mount Counties regarding the fight against the deadly Ebola virus, from Wednesday- Thursday, 3-4 September 2014, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The JTF was setup to provide support to health workers and civil authorities, quarantined affected areas and stop the mass movement of people to and from affected areas in order to prevent the spread of Ebola. The JTF operation entails all necessary security measures that are employed, such as containment of movements, ensuring of requisite health screening as various entry and exit points, security checks, etc., to curb the spread of the debilitating Ebola pandemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the two-day tour was to inspect/ assess the operation status of the JTF assigned in the four counties and to get firsthand Ebola updates from county's authorities, health workers and locals. Some other senior members of the assessment tour included Colonel Prince C. Johnson, III, Brigade Commander of the AFL; Commissioner Robert Budy, Deputy Commissioner for Operations, Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN); Deputy Senior Inspector for Leeward, Alexander Seye, Liberia National Police (LNP); Colonel Abubakkar, ECOWAS Mentor to the AFL; Colonel Hugh Evans, British Mentor to the AFL and U.S. Mentor to the AFL Colonel David Bunn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intent of your deployment in these areas is to help the locals, but not to hurt them,&quot; General Ziankhan reminded members of the JTF deployed at the Temor Bridge in Rivercess County, Dolo Town, Margibi County, Klay Checkpoint and Tubmanburg, Bomi County; and Boo Waterside, Grand Cape Mount County; respectively. He admonished members of the JTF to always cooperate and coordinate their security efforts and operate from a joint perspective to have a holistic effect in achieving the goal of the Commander-in-Chief, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in this Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Ziankhan further clarified that the AFL is not in charge, but is part of the JTF to enhance the work of the LNP, BIN, DEA, NFS and NSA by providing backup when these institutions are overwhelmed. He further cautioned the troops to be cognizant of the fact that they are working for the population and not for themselves and should avoid doing things that will embarrass the counties in which they are assigned, their respective institutions and the Country at large. &quot;Be mindful of the cascading effects of your individual and collective actions on your leaders and the Government of Liberia,&quot; the Army Chief warned personnel of the JTF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then admonished the JTF personnel to build good relationship with the locals that will go a very long way. &quot;Everything you do here brings your career on the line. No matter the institution you represent under this operation, think before you act because whatever you do, you are just filling in your own evaluation paper. The people you see here are just everyday people; you may see them in Monrovia or anywhere in the future, so build a lasting relationship with the locals and continue your good work,&quot; General Ziankhan tipped members of the JTF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Deputy Commissioner Robert Budy encouraged members of the JTF to keep up the good work and continue to remain ambassadors in the areas assigned, indicating that the best way to deal with the Ebola virus is to disseminate the facts concerning Ebola to the locals when and where ever possible. He lauded personnel of the JTF for all the positive reports received about them from Counties authorities, health workers and the locals and advised them to maintain coordination, collaboration and cooperation at the county, community and security levels to eradicate the deadly Ebola virus from Liberia, emphasizing that they are in a joint effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also told members of the JTF to make good use of the logistics at their disposal in this time of health contingency. &quot;This is a national call to duty; most of you are going to be complaining about so many challenges, but I don't want you to see the challenges as a barrier; see it as strength because the Government is stretched and that is what we are called to do in such times like these. The Government is also relying on international partners in this crisis,&quot; Deputy Commissioner Budy cautioned JTF personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Yakpah Town, Rivercess County, the delegation met with senior county authorities, including the Superintendent, County Police Commander, Chief Medical Officer of Rivercess, Dr. Wilmot Smith and UNMIL Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Smith, before the arrival of the JTF, the County Task Force dealt with the total of 7 Ebola- related deaths and had 47 Ebola contacts, but since the deployment of the JTF on August 23, 2014 and form the quick response from the AFL, the health situation in Rivercess concerning the Ebola virus has considerably improved. There has been no new Ebola case has reported of recently, and the number of contacts has dropped from 47 to 20. The JTF has helped strengthen the county health surveillance system and reduced the workload of health practitioners in Rivercess because of the prompt response from the JTF team, especially the AFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the UNMIL Boss in Rivercess recommended to the delegation that the JTF presence be maintained and strength be beefed up until the situation of Ebola contacts which fluctuates becomes zero because of the good work being done by the security personnel assigned in Rivercess. He further iterated that the security situation of the County is good. Besides, the delegation, in a town-hall meeting, met with the Superintendent of Rivercess County and his team of local leaders and discussed the general security situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to MoD/AFL Public Affairs personnel, Honorable Henries Marcus Pearl, District Superintendent, Mboo Statutory District, Margibi County, said that his overall impression of the JTF operation in Dolo Town is that the JTF is performing exceptionally well. &quot;The security personnel assigned here are brave and intelligent and have been conducting themselves like trained and disciplined people,&quot; Honorable Pearl stated. He further rained praises on the JTF saying &quot;We are happy that you could contribute such brilliant, intelligent and well-organized force to quarantine this area. We are gratified and we appreciate the contribution of the AFL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Pearl informed the delegation that since Dolo Town was quarantined, there has been a cordial relationship between the Joint Security and the citizens of Dolo Town. &quot;We have never had a situation in which I was called to intervene; this gives us the impression that the configuration of the JTF is the daybreak of a new dawn in the civilization of Liberia,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, Superintendent Pearl thanked the President of Liberia, Madam Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, for her rapid response to the humanitarian crisis of Dolo Town, indicating that things are getting almost on course. &quot;The health and humanitarian situation has quite improved; tracing by surveillance team is on course, but we need a robust response from the Ministry of Health so as to keep Ebola not only out of Dolo Town but also out of Liberia,&quot; he emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Mount County, the delegation was briefed by the Acting Immigration Commander and Joint Security Chairman at Boo Waterside, Colonel Stephen Melba. He informed the delegation of the most recent Ebola death in Dambala of a young man, identified as Konah, who left his resident in Monrovia, specifically the Kuwait Area in Duala for Cape Mount after receiving information that his girlfriend and mother-in-law have both died from Ebola. Upon arrival in Cape Mount, Konah was met and welcomed by a huge crowd of youth based on his popularity in Dambala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 27 persons came in direct contacts with Konah before he died. From the 27 persons, 25 have been quarantined. In Robertsport, 30 persons were quarantined and one person died just upon completing her 21-day expiration. 19 persons were to graduate on September 4, 2014, but the remaining 10 persons will be quarantined for another 21 days because they had contacts with the dead person. Besides, Madam Kebbeh Morris, Representative of the Ministry of Health, informed the delegation that health condition at the Boo Waterside concerning Ebola is OK. The hand washing sensitization process is ongoing and people are complying with the JTF instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival in Tubmanburg, Youth Representative, Alieu Nyei, wholeheartedly welcomed the Chief of Staff and his delegation on behalf of the people of Bomi. &quot;The AFL as part of the JTF has projected a very new and dynamic image which has brought about the restoration of confidence in your men. Working in collaboration with the people of Bomi, the AFL has created a peaceful atmosphere through which the people go about their everyday businesses,&quot; Mr. Nyen informed the high-power JTF delegation. He also indicated that the people of Bomi are adhering very much to the Ebola preventive measures as advised by the Ministry of Health and every other person fighting Ebola and then invited the delegation members to a drum containing Clorox and soap water to wash their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the delegation had a stop at the Klay Checkpoint, Bomi and then returned to Monrovia. The purpose of the two-day tour was to assess the operation status of the JTF assigned in the four counties and to get firsthand Ebola updates from county's authorities, health workers and locals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Okech Ojony Joa said there is always a resurgence of the Ebola virus after being brought under control in the affected country, adding, &quot;it has attacked my country (Uganda) about six different times and can strike anywhere in that country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Joa made the statement at the compound of the Charles Henry Rennie Memorial Hospital in Kakata Wednesday during the reopening of the hospital, the Liberia News Agency reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Joa said the Ebola virus for the first time attacked his country Uganda in early 2000 and was followed by five others, plus three additional attacks of other infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Joa, a consultant at the World Health Organization (WHO), said the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia was making some significant gains, but added that the country needs to act faster to be ahead of future outbreaks in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, responding to community members' calls for help in talking to health facilities suspected or confirmed family members was very important to their survival as the care and attention given strengthens them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then commended the Liberian government for allowing Ugandan doctors to come and share their experiences with their Liberian counterparts and people in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assured the government and people of Liberia that they will work closely with them to ensure that the virus is contained and subsequently eradicated from Liberia. LINA</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has met with the leaders and representatives of registered political parties on the current Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia. The Liberian leader invited the political party leaders to brief and update them on the ravaging Ebola outbreak in the country as well as to solicit their input in sustaining national efforts to contain the further spread of the disease in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the meeting, which was held in the C. Cecil Dennis Auditorium on Friday, September 5, brought together several registered political parties/coalitions, including the National Patriotic Party (NPP), Congress for Democratic Change (CDC), Alternative National Congress (ANC), Alliance for Peace and Democracy (APD), National Democratic Coalition (NDC), All Liberia Coalition Party, Liberty Party, among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf welcomed the political party leaders and provided updates on the different plans and interventions made by the government since the latest outbreak of the Ebola virus disease. She underscored the critical importance of the involvement of all Liberians including leaders of political parties and their membership in efforts to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She introduced Health and Social Welfare Minister, Dr. Walter Gwenegalie; Assistant Minister of Health for Preventive Services, Mr. Tolbert Nyenswah, who coordinates the Incidence Management System; and the Coordinator of the National Ebola Resource Center, Mr. Dorbor Jallah, who briefed the political parties leaders about their work and pleaded with them to get fully involved in the fight against the further spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Gwenigale urged the political leaders to join the prevention and health promotion aspect of the fight to ensure behavioral change among the population. &quot;Once that is achieved,&quot; Dr. Gwenigale indicated, &quot;much more progress will be made in containing the further spread of the virus.&quot; He appealed to the political parties and coalitions to play their part in defeating the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister Nyenswah explained the different stages and programs under the Incidence Management System to include Prevention &amp; Health Promotion, Treatment, Testing, Surveillance &amp; Contact Tracing, Safe Burial, and Psychosocial Support. He admitted challenges with the treatment component of the program due to limited treatment centers, but informed the political leaders that five additional treatment centers will shortly be operational in addition to the John F. Kennedy and ELWA treatment centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of the five situated at Island Clinic near St. Paul Bridge on Bushrod Island expected to be operational next week while the others will be concluded soon. Testing and removal of the dead for burial are also being improved, Minister Nyenswah assured. He called for unity among all Liberians in the fight against the deadly virus. nternal Affairs Minister Morris Dukuly and Coordinator of the National Ebola Resource Center Dorbor Jallah also briefed the leaders of political parties about their work which include resource mobilization, logistics and safe burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making interventions, the leaders of political parties agreed generally that the Ebola crisis should not be politicized and recommended a bottom to top approach in containing the spread of the disease. They also recommended that the political parties be considered and treated like components of the local government structures in supporting the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also spoke on issues such as the State of Emergency, curfew, Senatorial midterm elections, and the full participation of all sectors of the Liberian society in the fight. The political parties/coalitions further expressed their commitment to sincerely join the national fight to ensure the containment of the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called for proactive actions to mitigate the potential economic crisis that may evolve during the post-Ebola era and urged government to work to ensure the resumption of full services at health facilities across the country. The parties also called on the government to pay particular attention to healthcare workers who are the front liners in the national fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to some of the concerns expressed by the political parties, President Sirleaf pointed out that the government has already concluded a mitigation plan that will address the post-Ebola challenges and is holding discussions with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, the U.S. Government, among others about the plan. She also told the parties that the situation of healthcare workers across the country and not just those involved with the Ebola fight have been looked into and decisions reached on the provision of incentives beyond the regular salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, President Sirleaf on Saturday visited the Township of West Point to access the current situation there, identify with victims of the recent conflict and to acquaint herself with the families of some of the students she has supported in school who are residents of West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families of the victims thanked President Sirleaf for keeping her promise to return and asked her to continuously stand by them in their difficult times. &quot;I will continue to follow-up on the status of those who still require medical follow-up and attention to ensure that the recovery process in conclusive,&quot; President Sirleaf assured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY GLEN OWEN AND JONATHAN PETRE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">486 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A LEADING academic has warned that university students could be at risk from the deadly ebola virus - because 21,000 students from countries in the affected region are about to arrive in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Glees, Professor of Politics at Buckingham University, called for West African students to be held in their home countries until they have been declared clear of ebola and the 21-day incubation period has passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments came as Sierra Leone announced that it was introducing a four-day  lockdown  to try to prevent the out-of-control epidemic from spreading further. People in the West African country will not be allowed to leave their homes from September 18 to 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease spreads through contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or contaminated environments and has killed more than 2,100 in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symptoms include fever, bleeding and damage to the central nervous system, and the current outbreak has a mortality rate of 55 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Glees accused the Government and universities of  extreme complacency  over the issue.  This plague is on the rampage,  he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What no one seems to realise is that we are potentially at grave risk from any one of the 21,000 students from West African states who are going to arrive in the UK over the next fortnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Students from affected countries could develop symptoms up to three weeks after arrival. Even where they have been screened before departing they may be sick. We should consider preventing them coming to the UK for 21 days so we can be sure they are not sick. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that  cash-strapped  universities regarding overseas students as  a vital source of income  were turning a blind eye to the risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Universities UK, the governing authority for the country s 136 universities, issued advice to campuses saying that the risk of infection was  very low .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a suspected case emerged, the patient should be immediately isolated - and looked after by staff equipped with  surgical gloves, plastic aprons, plastic visors and surgical facemasks .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Professor Glees said:  No university has this kind of kit to hand unless they have medical schools. Many universities are in smaller towns and do not have the facilities of larger cities such as London. Students are not only obliged to share toilet and shower facilities, but exchanging bodily fluids is something they do with great frequency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am appalled by the total lack of practical advice, training or equipment for those working in universities who may come into contact with infected students. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, last night Dr Ben Neuman, a virology expert at Reading University who teaches students from West Africa, said:  The screening system at airports means that the numbers of infected patients potentially reaching the UK is tiny. Universities who think they have a case on their hands would refer it immediately to hospital. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITV, 9.00PM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) and Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) are back for a fourth series of the hugely popular detective drama. At the end of series three, we saw the Manchester murder investigation duo putting aside some big differences in order to save the life of their kidnapped boss DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore). Tonight, though, they're in competition with one another for a promotion that would make one of them the other's line manager. Will their fractured friendship survive it? The answer to that question lies at the heart of the new series, which begins with a tangled investigation into the disappearance of a vulnerable teenager.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time, ace writer Sally Wainwright (who wrote 19 of the 22 previous episodes) has no involvement, the success of Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley drawing her talents elsewhere. But Bullmore doubles up her role as super-efficient DCI Murray with writing four of this series' eight episodes and on the evidence of this engrossing opener (and previous contributions) she is more than up to the job, setting up some deliciously fraught storylines to play out over the rest of the season. (She does have form as a writer, having also written for This Life and Big Train). As ever Sharp and Jones get the chemistry just right, especially when it's veering towards the brittle, and the arrival of major new influences in their lives should guarantee their relationship stays as tricky as fans clearly like it to be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny McKinstry could be doing it a more straightforward way. He could still be where he had expected to be: in the United States, scaling the ladder from working with New York Red Bulls' Academy. Perhaps some kind of role around a senior team would have come up by now and, even if not, a coach in his twenties should not need to fixate upon the sands of time too attentively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McKinstry, 29, is nearly five years out of New York and this afternoon he will cajole from the touchline as his Sierra Leone team face Ivory Coast in Abidjan. A positive result would set them off and running in a fiendish Africa Cup of Nations qualifying group that also includes Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not the extent of the challenge: Ivory Coast's government agreed to host the game on Tuesday, fears over the spread of the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone having severely compromised their preparations. Organised football games are banned in Sierra Leone as efforts to contain the virus continue, and it is unlikely they will host any of their three home fixtures. For a young Northern Irish coach whose own journey has been notable enough, there is unimaginable extra significance in representing the country. &quot;One of the things I've said to the players, and we're all in complete agreement, is that we will be - not just want to be, will be - the good news story for Sierra Leone,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's happening is a nightmare. I've seen so much development in my four and a half years here, so much good work in improving the infrastructure, so much progress, and now the whole country is taking a hit. But we've committed to bringing something positive, and there's no doubt the national team's success can have a direct impact on the psyche. If we can take Sierra Leone to the Africa Cup of Nations, then hopefully people will see the positives in the country again and, once the situation has been taken hold of, we can help attract them back here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinstry, from Lisburn, arrived in 2010 to work at the Craig Bellamy Foundation, an academy set up by the now-retired Welshman within a few hundred metres of the Freetown Peninsula's extraordinary beaches. Those sands are layered above, but can never completely mask, the scars of the brutal civil war of the 1990s. Football continues to play its part in Sierra Leone's rehabilitation and McKinstry - still the academy manager - has done more than most. Last year, after the departure of the Swedish coach Lars-Olof Mattsson, he put himself forward to take over. &quot;I was very focused on my work with the academy, but I expected that an opportunity might come up at some stage,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it did arise, there were only three World Cup qualifiers left and I guessed they would probably appoint a locally based coach. I thought, 'If I can just get myself in the room with the decision-makers then it won't be a decision for them - it will be obvious.' I made a presentation about how I saw the team's present and future, and got the phone call a few days later. Without sounding arrogant, I believed I was the best man for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures do not lie. The six matches on McKinstry's watch have been World Cup or Cup of Nations qualifiers. They have lost one; a win in his first match in charge, against Tunisia, would have put them in the hunt for Brazil and was only denied them by an injury-time goalkeeping error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The team I look at now is a completely different animal to the one of 15 months ago,&quot; he says. &quot;The average age is now around 23 or 24. It was 29 or 30 when I came in. There is a lot more speed about the team. We're trying to play a more attacking brand of football, and the players have all come on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An overseas-based squad - largely based in Scandinavia and the US but including the ex-Middlesbrough forward Kei Kamara and the Tranmere Rovers winger Abdulai Bell-Baggie - will play in Abidjan and then, on Wednesday, against DR Congo in a home fixture that must now be played in the Congolese city Lubumbashi. They are well schooled in fraught away trips, at least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the first round of the qualifiers we travelled to Swaziland, and you'll always expect some kind of bump in the road on a journey like that,&quot; says McKinstry. &quot;But you don't expect your team and delegation to be refused entry to a plane to Johannesburg in Nigeria through not having South African visas that they didn't even need. My physio and I had to make the journey ahead of everyone else to greet the 10 players who were coming from overseas. On the flight we were sat there sketching out how we'd start and finish a match with 10 men, at high altitude. We had to make a serious plan for it. But they caught us up in the end, just, and most importantly we got the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was further drama in the round before the group stage, when Seychelles - 2-0 down from the first leg - decided to forfeit their home fixture on account of the developing Ebola situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were in Nairobi and, again, about to step on to the aeroplane to the Seychelles. We were going along the skywalk into the plane, when someone shouted back at us: 'Sierra Leone team, Sierra Leone team.' A few phone calls later and we knew that if the game didn't go ahead we would qualify, but it wasn't the most relaxing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinstry has a mantra for young players at the academy: &quot;You've got to be comfortable living outside your comfort zone.&quot; He would know. &quot;I've always been someone to take the challenging option,&quot; he says. &quot;So there's definitely no apprehension going into these games. We believe we can take points off these big names and unseat one of them, which we'll have to do if we want to take our place in the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're desperate to do our bit - to give Sierra Leone the good news it hasn't had. It is a tough time, but the people here have remarkable fortitude. This country will come through the crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's happening is a nightmare. I've seen so much development in my four and a half years here, so much good work in improving the infrastructure, so much progress, and now the whole country is taking a hit. But we've committed to bringing something positive, and there's no doubt the national team's success can have a direct impact on the psyche. If we can take Sierra Leone to the Africa Cup of Nations, then hopefully people will see the positives in the country again and, once the situation has been taken hold of, we can help attract them back here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinstry, from Lisburn, arrived in 2010 to work at the Craig Bellamy Foundation, an academy set up by the now-retired Welshman within a few hundred metres of the Freetown Peninsula's extraordinary beaches. Those sands are layered above, but can never completely mask, the scars of the brutal civil war of the 1990s. Football continues to play its part in Sierra Leone's rehabilitation and McKinstry - still the academy manager - has done more than most. Last year, after the departure of the Swedish coach Lars-Olof Mattsson, he put himself forward to take over. &quot;I was very focused on my work with the academy, but I expected that an opportunity might come up at some stage,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it did arise, there were only three World Cup qualifiers left and I guessed they would probably appoint a locally based coach. I thought, 'If I can just get myself in the room with the decision-makers then it won't be a decision for them - it will be obvious.' I made a presentation about how I saw the team's present and future, and got the phone call a few days later. Without sounding arrogant, I believed I was the best man for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures do not lie. The six matches on McKinstry's watch have been World Cup or Cup of Nations qualifiers. They have lost one; a win in his first match in charge, against Tunisia, would have put them in the hunt for Brazil and was only denied them by an injury-time goalkeeping error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The team I look at now is a completely different animal to the one of 15 months ago,&quot; he says. &quot;The average age is now around 23 or 24. It was 29 or 30 when I came in. There is a lot more speed about the team. We're trying to play a more attacking brand of football, and the players have all come on board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An overseas-based squad - largely based in Scandinavia and the US but including the ex-Middlesbrough forward Kei Kamara and the Tranmere Rovers winger Abdulai Bell-Baggie - will play in Abidjan and then, on Wednesday, against DR Congo in a home fixture that must now be played in the Congolese city Lubumbashi. They are well schooled in fraught away trips, at least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the first round of the qualifiers we travelled to Swaziland, and you'll always expect some kind of bump in the road on a journey like that,&quot; says McKinstry. &quot;But you don't expect your team and delegation to be refused entry to a plane to Johannesburg in Nigeria through not having South African visas that they didn't even need. My physio and I had to make the journey ahead of everyone else to greet the 10 players who were coming from overseas. On the flight we were sat there sketching out how we'd start and finish a match with 10 men, at high altitude. We had to make a serious plan for it. But they caught us up in the end, just, and most importantly we got the job done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was further drama in the round before the group stage, when Seychelles - 2-0 down from the first leg - decided to forfeit their home fixture on account of the developing Ebola situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were in Nairobi and, again, about to step on to the aeroplane to the Seychelles. We were going along the skywalk into the plane, when someone shouted back at us: 'Sierra Leone team, Sierra Leone team.' A few phone calls later and we knew that if the game didn't go ahead we would qualify, but it wasn't the most relaxing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinstry has a mantra for young players at the academy: &quot;You've got to be comfortable living outside your comfort zone.&quot; He would know. &quot;I've always been someone to take the challenging option,&quot; he says. &quot;So there's definitely no apprehension going into these games. We believe we can take points off these big names and unseat one of them, which we'll have to do if we want to take our place in the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we're desperate to do our bit - to give Sierra Leone the good news it hasn't had. It is a tough time, but the people here have remarkable fortitude. This country will come through the crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in west African nation barred from leaving their homes on 18-21 September to 'deal with Ebola once and for all'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone will impose a four-day nationwide &quot;lockdown&quot; this month in a bid to contain the spread of the biggest ever outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 18 to 21 September people across the west African nation will not be allowed to leave their homes, a senior official in the president's office said on Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is intended to allow health workers to identify and isolate new cases to prevent the disease from spreading further, said Ibrahim Ben Kargbo, a presidential adviser on the country's Ebola task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The aggressive approach is necessary to deal with the spread of Ebola once and for all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, more than 3,000 people have been infected in west Africa, with almost 2,100 deaths from the virus recorded in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria since March, according to UN figures. As of Friday, Sierra Leone has recorded 491 deaths. Last week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that there could be another 20,000 cases before the Ebola outbreak is stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO announced on Friday that health workers could be given vaccines from November, when safety tests are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 infected health workershave died in Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kargbo said 21,000 people would be recruited to enforce the lockdown. Thousands of police officers and soldiers have already been deployed to enforce the quarantining of towns in Sierra Leone's worst-hit regions, near the border with Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations from across the world are rushing funds and equipment to west Africa, but Ebola is spreading faster than ever and experts say the lack of trained staff in weak health systems is a major obstacle to the response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week the director general of the WHO, Dr Margaret Chan, called for a massive global response to the outbreak and suggested it would take longer to control than has been assumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Washington, she said it would take at least six to nine months to halt the virus and cost more than $600m (&pound;365m).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chan said the west Africa outbreak was &quot;the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen&quot; and spreading at a pace that outstrips effort to control it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest affected area is Port Harcourt in Nigeria, where it is likely that the virus will have been transmitted to many people from an infected doctor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.On Monday, September 1, 2014, the Press Union of Liberia got a call that personnel from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), accompanied by Police Officers had called at the premises of the FrontPageAfrica Newspaper to enforce an action to stop the paper from using their generator on environmental grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUL/01/09-2/14</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 4, 2014</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Honorable Christiana Tah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister, Ministry of Justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia, Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear MinisterTah:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We present the compliments of the Press Union of Liberia, and wish to apprise you of the following developments within the Liberian media space that have become of increasing concern to us. We are increasingly concerned about the rapid deterioration in fundamental freedoms in Liberia upon the action and or inaction of government actors. This runs contrary to the constitutional obligations to protect these rights. The Press Union of Liberia recognizes the nature of the health emergency in our country and respects the number of measures that have been taken to address them, both by government, as well as local, civic and international development partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We, however, believe that nothing under the circumstances created by this emergency shall be used as an alibi to undermine the rights and freedoms of Liberians, especially and including journalists, lest to mention the obligation of the government to ensure that all Liberians have full guarantees of these rights. Strategically, the Press Union of Liberia has insisted upon its membership in the National Ebola Task Force, though the role of the Task Force has itself been merely a forum for the sharing of information from organs that are implementing activities. This participation continues to inspire journalists, media institutions and civil society organizations that this is a national obligation that should involve all persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Tah,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia's attention is specifically drawn to several circumstances that do not only restrain journalists in their obligation to seek out and share useful news and information with the public, but significantly threaten even media participation in the global fight against Ebola. By all accounts, the media space in Liberia has been a significant partner in the fight to strengthen awareness in our society about the impact and challenges of the epidemic. Notwithstanding the loss of revenue due to the emergency nature of the epidemic and the effect on general life, the media has remained committed to this fight. Unfortunately, several actions against media by government actors, especially during these times, have simply given room to growing skepticism about the disease, and further exacerbating the denials within the community. We think this is unfair and improper. We especially wish to draw your attention to the following episodes which note the severity with which disregard for the freedom of media is becoming:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Closure of The National Chronicle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) has protested the Thursday, August 14, 2014 forced and illegal closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper, as well as the arrest of several staff, including News Editor Emmanuel Mensah and IT Officer Emmanuel Logan, and the manhandling of Philibert S. Browne, Jr. Since then, the paper's publisher Philipbert Browne has been subjected to nearly daily questioning at the Liberia National Police Headquarters. The Press Union sees these actions as a further expression of intolerance, an unwarranted attack on the free press and a failure by the government to utilize due process. We seriously believe this action strengthens the distrust between the government and the media, undermines the rule of law and lays to waste the fruitful collaboration that has existed between the media and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Ignoring Media in Imposition of Curfew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 19, 2014 President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced the imposition of a 9-hour curfew, effective as of August 20, 2014. Early, on August 20, 2014, we engaged the government about the curfew, indicating the necessity to have a reprieve for journalists. Later that very day, an exemption list was issued, absolutely ignoring the media. We had to take further action to get the exemption for journalists clarified. This does not speak to the partnership that both the government and the Press Union of Liberia have repeatedly spoken about on various occasions. The truth is - no journalist or anyone for that matter would want to be outdoors, when all of their associates are indoors. Our insistence upon a curfew exemption was not as a matter of having an undeserved privilege, but rather to ensure that the work of gathering and disseminating news and information is not obstructed at any point. You will agree with us that any disruption of the free flow of news and information, whether anticipated or not, will project a scenario of doom and accelerate falsehood, which does not make the crisis any easier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Harassment of Women Voices Publisher</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of Friday, August 29, 2014, the Press Union of Liberia received a call from the Management of the Women Voices Newspaper that they were being invited to the Police. We intervened and said we will accompany them with a lawyer. When it became obvious that a lawyer would not be available because of the time, we reached an understanding with the Police for a rescheduling at noon on Saturday, August 30. At the police station, Ms Nah was informed that she was under investigation for a newspaper story, which had alleged corruption in the police. Before we knew anything, the police had demanded a mugshot and fingerprints. This surprised us, given that this was simply an invitation that had turned into an investigation, and now we see aspects of criminal procedures being applied. In our resistance, we were advised by our counsel to accept their ploy and seek remedy through law. By all means, had this been a criminal matter, mugshots and fingerprints would have been seen as normal. But introducing these in a matter that is yet so civil, and being enforced under the threats of imprisonment is bad faith, harassment of a peaceful citizen, a further action to humiliate journalists and prevent them from the lawful discharge of their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. FrontPageAfrica Generator Blockade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, September 1, 2014, the Press Union of Liberia got a call that personnel from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), accompanied by Police Officers had called at the premises of the FrontPageAfrica Newspaper to enforce an action to stop the paper from using their generator on environmental grounds. When we tried to enquire the action, the officers left. Again on the evening of September 3, we learnt that the team returned, but this time with a forklift to remove the generator. While the generator was eventually not moved, due to community resistance, our issue here is why would government officers get involved in enforcing an action in the absence of due process of law? This takes away from the greater responsibilities that they have to do, given the current circumstances in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Tah,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequential order of these actions is telling us a story different from the public statements that have been made at various levels of government about some commitment to a free press and a democratic society. We see these as deliberate actions to limit the role of the media in the national discourse, under the guise of a state of emergency. Fortunately for us, the authors of our current constitutions were very mindful of sad episodes in our previous history, and were determined not to leave any loopholes for infringements of rights. As a result, they made lots of safeguards to prevent those who would eventually assume national leadership positions from abusing the rights of citizens, and as such the current state of emergency does not give any room for arbitrary actions that would limit individual freedoms, insofar as rights and obligations are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions enumerated here - whether in the case of The National Chronicle, The Women Voices and The FrontPageAfrica - have tacitly threatened and limited these organizations in enjoying these fundamental freedoms. By no means have these media opted to limit the role of the government or other partners in addressing the purpose of the current emergency in our country. We therefore request that you denounce these actions by the Police and, especially in the case of the FrontPageAfrica - the Environmental Protection Agency, as foolhardy and unlawful. We also request that you take appropriate actions to remedy the harassment and intimidation of the journalists, by simply reaffirming their rights to enjoy their freedom of expression, as guaranteed by our constitution. We further request that you take appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions to curb future unlawful actions by those involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awaiting your kind regards in the premises, we remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best regard,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sincerely yours,</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Government says cumulative suspected, probable and confirmed Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases in the country now stand at 1,763 for the period May 29 to September 1, 2014. Giving an Ebola update at the Ministry of Information daily briefing Wednesday, Information Minister Lewis G. Brown said total confirmed cases now stand at 406, while probable and suspected cases are 845 and 512 respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also puts the total number of cumulative EVD patients being held in quarantine at 286, with 220 in Montserrado and 66 are in Lofa counties. The Liberia News Agency quotes Minister Brown as saying the total number of patients discharged as of September 1 remains at 25. According to the report, the total deaths in confirmed, probable and suspected cases were 1,004, with 390 confirmed, 379 probable and 235 as suspected. The Information Minister put the cumulative deaths among health workers at 150, with 74 confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Liberia's case fatality rate in confirmed and probable EVD incidence stands at 61.5 percent. Case fatality rate is the proportion of deaths within a designated population of cases over the course of a prevailing disease. The report said Montserrado County has shown significant improvement in contact tracing at 877 people, which constitutes 97 percent of 905 contacts under follow-up were identified and seen by the health team.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL) has contributed US$150, 000.00 (one-hundred &amp; fifty-thousand dollars) to the Ebola Trust Fund to assist government in its effort to fight the spread of the Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation Thursday, Sept 4, at the company's head office in Monrovia, the President and Chief Executive Officer of NOCAL, Dr. Randolph AKW McClain, said the donation was intended to support government's initiatives to curb the spread of the virus. Dr. McClain spoke about the immeasurable human toll of the virus on families, its crippling effect on the economy and the additional burden of the government's efforts to provide the basic needed services for its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NOCAL President, on behalf of the company's Board of Directors, management and staff, extended sympathy to families who have lost loved ones to the virus and thanked health workers and other individuals and institutions for contributing to the effort to fight the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NOCAL Chief Executive Officer urged citizens and other residents to play their part by contributing as well and adhering to the measures put in place by the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare and the National Ebola Task Force to help contain the spread of Ebola and save more lives, adding, &quot;this fight will only succeed if we all join hands and work together to contain Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the Deputy Minister of Finance for Fiscal Affairs, Dr. James F. Kollie, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, thanked the NOCAL family for the gesture, which he said represented the single largest contribution by any public or private local entity. He assured NOCAL that the funds would be used exclusively towards the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kollie said while the government is seeking more funding and contributions are being made, each citizen and resident must take personal responsibility to ensure that the transmission of the virus is broken and brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The September 4th contribution represents the latest significant contribution NOCAL has made towards the national effort to contain the spread of the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. Last week, NOCAL presented Personal Protective Equipment to the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare, valued at more than US$84,000.00 (eighty-four thousand dollars). The company also presented several materials to a local Non-Governmental Organization, 'Feed the Future' in its effort to support the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace Ambassador George Manneh Weah has been moving the first huge consignment of assorted anti Ebola materials to the ELWA Hospital in Paynesville City, the main holding and treatment center of Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a mobile phone conversation with the Liberia's Peace Ambassador's Office on Thursday, Mr. Quiwu Yekeh, an aid to Ambassador Weah, confirmed that the peace ambassador has brought into the country several materials that, some of which assorted items he has donated to the ELWA Hospital which is being the first to receive the anti-Ebola consignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Yekeh, who said the items would be districted amongst other Senators did not provide more detail about what are contained in the consignment donate to the premier Ebola treatment center that is to be presented to the management of the ELWA Hospital but said that the materials would be very helpful to Liberians in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the materials would be presented to the hospital today, Mr. Yekeh noted the Liberian Peace Ambassador will use the occasion of the presentation of the items to provide detail information about the materials. Before them, critics have said that the Peace Ambassador and the leader of the opposition Congress for Democratic Change CDC has been doing nothing to contribute to fight against the outbreak of the virus in Liberia despite the massive political support he enjoys from the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the criticism, the CDC's National Executive Committee announced the composition of a 26 -man task force that will lead activities in CDC respond or fight against the Ebola virus in the 15 counties of Liberia, although it is not known which of his institutions would make the expected donation today. According to Mr. Yekeh, Ambassador Weah is committed to see Liberia and Liberians being redeemed from the ongoing Ebola nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weah, who will be donating his first consignment ever of the anti -Ebola materials to the hospital will continue the distributions to other Ebola treatment centers in and around Liberia, according to Yekeh from his peace-building office. The senior officer in the Liberia Peace Ambassador office also said Ambassador Weah disclosed that he has developed an uncompromising desire to requesting goodwill individuals and friendly nations to assist Liberia in the fight against the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ELWA Hospital is the first big center set aside for the holding and testing of suspected and Ebola patients in the response to the outbreak of the disease in the country, making it the main focus for local and international partners involved in the battle against the virus from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the outbreak, it was said that Liberia's Peace Ambassador George Weah was in Europe, rallying support from the nations he has high influence with as well as friends and goodwill individuals to embark on initiatives leading to the his participation in the fight against the pestilence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Management of Sak Souk Shopping Center located at the Barnersville junction donated several items to the Liberian National Police (LNP) yesterday. The Management said the donation of the items to the LNP is its way of buttressing the efforts of the government in helping to fight the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The items which include 50 sac of mineral water, seven cartons of hand sanitizer, 8 cartoon of energy biscuit, four cartoons of detergent soap, eight cartons of juice, one carton of dettol and 5 crates of soft drink were turned over to police Assistance Chief of traffic, Supt. Franklin D. Howard, who will then deliver the items to the Deputy Inspector General, Director William K. Mulbah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The items, the management noted, are intended to render full support of police officers who are working around the clock to ensure that basic services are delivered, while maintaining law and order. &quot;As a long standing partner with the people of Liberia who is thriving with them through their darkest years of conflict,&quot; the Management of Sak Souk noted, &quot;[we have observed]that the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has created some economic setback which had led to the slowest pace in business activities in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management further noted that with the little contribution made towards the fight against the Ebola virus, it is the hope of the management that more efforts from other business people can be directed towards this effort so as to help the government achieve its target. The management added that people should adhere to measures put in place by national health authorities and partners, saying that driving Ebola from the country should be a matter of concern to every Liberian resident including citizens and members of the business communities amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Police's Deputy Inspector General Mr. William K. Mulbah, on behalf of the law enforcers, thanked the management of Sak Souk for its contribution towards the fight against the deadly Ebola virus. Director Mulbah said the items donated to the police will be distributed amongst officers of the police who have been quarantined at the police barrack on Camp Johnson Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He applauded the efforts of Police Asst. Chief of Traffic for operations, Superintendent Franklin D. Howard for having been able to lobby for such assistance in identifying with the police. He urged fellow police officers and other well-meaning Liberians to follow the example of their colleagues and join in the fight of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is unfolding here today indicates that the police are truly committed to eradicating the virus, and this should not be seen as a mere bluff&quot;, he said. According to him, &quot;It is important to note that in our fight against the Ebola disease, the police is always prepared to carry out its function as required by our mandate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents of Montserrado County District #16 have finally launched its task force against the deadly Ebola virus disease in the country. The event which took place Wednesday brought together all the leaders of the 21 communities in the District, including all of the reputable groupings, motorcyclists, religious leaders, and some eminent citizens. Speaking at the launching ceremony in New Kru town, the group said that it is ready to battle the virus in line with the government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the task force, Mr. Barcus Karpeh, said the government has agreed to give the D. Twe High School in New Krutown to be used as observation center and the island hospital in St. Paul Bridge for treatment center. Mr. Karpeh further disclosed that three jeeps made available by Hon. Dixon Seeboe, Bishop P. Mannesah Conto and Mr. Harrison Togba of the Borough of New Krutown to be used by the task force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the president of the Federation of Borough Youth (FOBY), Mr. Sonsala C. Parson told The Analyst that a list of people that are affected with the virus has been presented to government through the health ministry to ensure that those carriers of the virus will be treated to ensure the containment of the disease. He said the contact-tracing team has already started its operation while the follow-up, spraying and burial teams are waiting for the opening of the center and training from the government to start operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Parsons said the youth are in gear to eradicate the Ebola virus from the borough which will indeed help the government to control the rapid spread of the epidemic. He added that every effort to drive Ebola out of the district has been made by the residents and is awaiting the intervention of government to back up the local work. Parson then added that the leaders and citizens are happy to work with the task force in the fight against the deadly and incurable disease in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'Come Unto Me' Children Ministry International, a local church ministry based in the West Point Community has sealed up a weeklong fast and prayer to invoke God's divine intervention in the fight against the Ebola virus in Liberia. The weeklong fast and prayer service, according to the founder of the ministry, Elder Daniel Sarfo-Gakpetor, will provide the opportunity for that children ministry to stand in the gab to seek the blessings of the Almighty to have mercy and eradicate the virus from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sarfo-Gakpetor said it was time that the church embarks on intercession for the country in a continuous prayer time with God in the wake of the outbreak of the virus if God is to pull down His blessings on the people of Liberia to wipe it away. He said the virus has claimed more lives and was still determined in claiming more lives, but could be prevented by the grace of God through regular prayer services in every church and community across Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weeklong fast and prayer which is drawn from the text Psalm 8:2 with the theme 'Out of the mouth of babies and infants God's designate power&quot; had in attendance children from five to twelve years seeking the power of God to fight against the virus. The fast and prayer will end with the children carrying placards with inscriptions such as 'What can take away Ebola from Liberia? Jesus! Liberia is covered with the Blood of Jesus among others, to climax the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of intense ongoing efforts by the Government of Liberia to curb the Ebola virus, an additional dosage of the experimental homeopathic drug for the virus has arrived in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Foreign Ministry release says a 3 kg package of experimental remedy containing sufficient doses for 30 infected persons in the treatment of Ebola arrived in the country from the International Emergency Management Organization (IEMO) in Italy. The arrival of the drug followed about two weeks of telephone conversational exchanges between Liberia's Foreign Minister, Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan and the Rome-based office of IEMO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the IEMO, this remedy is an aqueous alternative medicine that promotes homeopathic cure with no side effect. Dr. Alessandro Manini, President of IEMO in a phone conversation last Friday with Foreign Minister Ngafuan intimated that once the effectiveness of the remedy is confirmed by the Ministry of Health, his organization will supply additional drugs at no cost to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. Manini lauded the Liberian Leader, Her Excellency, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and her Government for the efforts thus far to curb the Ebola virus, and pledged the full support of the IEMO and his personal commitment to the people of Liberia during this difficult period in arresting the spread of the Ebola Virus. The Chief Executive of IEMO then expressed sympathy to families affected by the virus and promised his organization's unflinching support to contain the outbreak. In furtherance of IEMO's support to Liberia, Dr. Manini said he is planning a solidarity and assessment mission to Liberia in October this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Foreign Minister Ngafuan on behalf of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Government and People of Liberia, thanked Dr. Manini and the International Emergency Management Organization, for the timely intervention by the provision of the experimental remedy and the attention shown Liberia at this crucial time. He affirmed Liberia's support to the work of the IEMO and welcomed the decision of Dr. Manini to visit Liberia in October, intimating that the people of Liberia will be very happy to receive him, considering the assistance of his organization at this critical time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven boxes of assorted medical items donated by Dr. Sana Rashed Al Fadala, Chairman and CEO of Taiba Hospital and IMS arrived in the country on September 2, 2014 to bolster Government's effort in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus. The items were donated at the initiative of Liberian Ambassador accredited to Kuwait, H.E. Konah K. Blackett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These medical items include, Non Woven Surgical Face Mask-Ear loops, Non Woven Surgical Face Mask-Ties, Disposable N 95 Face Masks, Medical Gloves powdered, Medical Gloves powdered X-, Medical Gloves powder free X-small and Alcohol swab pad. According to a dispatch from the Liberian Embassy in Kuwait, His Excellency Ambassador Konah K. Blackett also stated that more supplies negotiated with him are to follow soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, the Government of Kuwait has made a contribution of US$5M to the World Health Organization (WHO) to assist the West Africa sub-region in the fight against the deadly Ebola epidemic, stated the dispatch. The Liberian Embassy near Kuwait City, expressed gratitude to the Kuwaiti donors of these essential items.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night after Alfred Jusson buried his first Ebola victim, he had a nightmare: the corpse sat on the edge of his bed, blood dripping from her nostrils. When he got up to run away, she chased him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months ago, Jusson had never heard of Ebola, one of the world's most lethal viruses. Now he volunteers to collect corpses, a job that puts him at the frontline of battle, as the disease is spread by contact with bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes when I think of it at home when I'm alone, I become scared. It's not easy to just (handle) a dead body like that,&quot; the 22-year-old said one evening after carrying out four burials in Kailahun, the remote, forested district at the heart of Sierra Leone's Ebola outbreak. Malaria, cholera and tuberculosis - endemic diseases that fell tens of thousands annually in Sierra Leone - used to be the illnesses that filled Jusson's days as he worked in his parents' tiny, dusty pharmacy and dreamed of one day becoming a doctor. In his spare time, he worked on the family's farm, saving and studying every day, until he was able to sit pre-university exams in December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in March, weeks before his results were due, Ebola erupted in neighbouring Guinea. It arrived in Liberia in April, and in Sierra Leone the next month. Unlike previous outbreaks, the disease has mushroomed in the capitals of all three countries, killing more than 1,900 people. Nigeria and Senegal have also recorded cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The outbreaks are racing ahead of the control efforts in these countries,&quot; said World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Margaret Chan. The WHO says more than 20,000 could eventually be infected in an outbreak that in the best-case scenario will continue for six more months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything from surgical gloves to ambulances is in short supply, but Ebola's real lethality may lie in the fear and isolation it spawns. One morning, residents in Kailahun woke up to find their only bank closed. Those with cars fled. Life picked up again, but a state of emergency in July shut down schools. Soldiers poured in to quarantine entire communities and, in these lush farming hills, trade slowed to a trickle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In desperation, 20 young men signed up for the burial teams, each paid $100 (&pound;61) a month for the task. They work to rigorous standards enforced by the Red Cross, but pay a heavy price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I'm passing, people I know say, 'Don't come near me',&quot; Jusson said. He looked skyward for a moment before continuing: &quot;I try to explain to them. If we don't volunteer to do this, there'll be nobody to bury the dead bodies because all of us will be infected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The burial team's battle for acceptance is a reflection of a wider struggle. Amid fear, confusion and conflicting public health messages surrounding west Africa's first recorded encounter with Ebola, Kailahun and its surrounding chiefdoms must make decisions that will be vindicated by time or become tragic missteps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What would people do if they had 10 people in their neighbourhood dying every day?&quot; said Barry Hewlett, a medical anthropologist who has worked in the midst of three outbreaks in central Africa. &quot;Would they trust the government? Which news station would they trust? Would they try to flee their neighbourhood?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some communities have encircled themselves with denial and trenches, violently blocking outsiders from coming in; others have overturned long-ingrained traditions to accommodate bewildering advice on identifying and isolating infected people that can result in victims facing a lonely death in a clinic far from home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola kills!&quot; was the initial motto of a belated nationwide campaign, a stark tone that may have dissuaded some sick people from coming forward to face that truth. The scramble for containment meant counselling was sidelined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of knowledge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, empathy is the place to start with Ebola. You're asking people to accept they're probably going to die in a few days' time. (You're) telling families to say goodbye to relatives they are never going to have human contact with again,&quot; said Raphael Frankfurter, director of the Wellbody Alliance, a medical charity based in Kono, where Sierra Leone's first case was recorded. &quot;There's a misconception that when people don't comply with public health messages, it's because they're ignorant or lacking knowledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters haven't been helped by years of mistrust as successive governments failed to deliver health services. Kailahun has just four ambulances for almost half a million residents. Yet the outbreak, which has killed more than all 26 previous episodes combined, need never have spiralled out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not rocket science,&quot; said David Heymann, who was part of the team that first identified the virus near the Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola river in 1976. &quot;If I'd been told then it would become a global public health emergency, my reaction would have been, 'That's very unfortunate, because we know exactly how to stop outbreaks in rural areas.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those methods are being implemented on a scrubby hill in Kailahun, the site of Medecins Sans Frontieres' biggest ever field hospital. But the 80 beds aren't enough, and the organisation says expanding without more boots on the ground will endanger staff and patients. Fear is also hobbling efforts. Survival rates hover at around 50% if early treatment is sought, but of the 1,038 Ebola patients seen by MSF across three countries, only 241 have survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they scour villages deep in the tropical forests, the burial team rely on spaceman-like suits for protection. If a bag of flour were poured over them, the suits should prevent even one grain touching their skin. But once the job is done, these very suits become a danger - they have to be removed without a grain of that flour getting on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is, no one in (the capital) Freetown wanted to come here and do this job,&quot; said Daniel James, the Red Cross team leader in Kailahun, as he prepared to lead the burial team one morning. &quot;Eventually my colleagues said, 'You're from Kailahun, you go.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second time in his life, James found himself burying corpses in Kailahun. The first had been when the district was at the heart of the 11-year civil war that ended in 2002. &quot;The boys are brave, but I can see they're scared sometimes,&quot; he said, pointing to the diggers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jusson arrived late, held back by the daily lecture from his mother as he set off for work. &quot;Forget about this job,&quot; she had pleaded. &quot;Qualified doctors and nurses have been dying. So who are you that you think you're not going to die if you're doing this?&quot; More than 240 frontliners have been infected during this outbreak, the highest rate ever. When Jusson tried to reassure his mother, she switched tactics. Even if he didn't care about dying, she said, the pharmacy's trade had dwindled because customers were scared when he approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell her you've been trained, it's a job now,&quot; Nickson Haruna, an 18-year-old colleague, advised Jusson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youngest of the so-called burial boys is 17-year-old Andrew Neyuma. &quot;I want to kick Ebola out of this country,&quot; he said, to nods from the others. &quot;Our population is already very small and Ebola wants to reduce it? No way!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the streets, many believe that Ebola was spread by local politicians to decimate the Kissi population ahead of elections, or that foreigners are using it as a way to harvest body parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, the rumours are fuelled by the fact that relatives rarely see those who succumb in hospitals as their bodies are doused in bleach, sealed in anonymous plastic bags and hurriedly buried to halt further contagion. After several attacks, the burial boys began chlorinating the bodies then opening windows, if possible, so that loved ones could watch what was happening inside. All the team members dread one day being called to a burial in their own villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In theory, one of the three burial teams is always on standby. In practice, there aren't enough cars or manpower to deal with the number of cases. Today one team is dispatched to the treatment centre, where there is a backlog of corpses waiting to be buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other team has to decide between two alerts in the community. Dia village is 15 miles away - which translates into nearly two hours' drive through the potholed forest roads. The second village is further, and they want to go there first to avoid returning well after midnight. But residents in Dia have been known to bury corpses if the burial team don't arrive quickly, a practice that periodically reignites new chains of infection. The team chooses Dia. Their two 4x4s slither up muddy banks overgrown with elephant grass on either side. A wall of forest green, broken only by tiny red flowers, orange cocoa leaves and sudden clearings of rice paddies unfurls for miles eastward into Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamba Morris, 28, the skinny local health co-ordinator, wearing black rubber gloves, greets the team with a look of relief. The first death in Dia was a month ago. He waited two days until angry villagers besieged his house. &quot;The body was rotting in this heat - the smell was too much. So I called together some youths, and we did our best to do a safe burial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in Dia believes that Mami Lamy - the woman they have come to bury - had Ebola, says Tamba Yussufu, a village elder wearing a faded T-shirt. &quot;But we're not medical practitioners, so when those who are tell us this is the way to do it, we accept it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yussufu forbade Lamy's grieving family from washing her body, as is customary. But three men approach nervously as the team gets ready. If they can't do burials the traditional way, can they at least stand at a distance and say a prayer over the body?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many specialists believe unrecorded rural outbreaks - both before and after the virus was identified in 1976 - may have burned themselves out as people adapted naturally after centuries of living in hostile environments. When medical anthropologist Hewlett reviewed the first recorded outbreak in DRC, he found that locals had isolated those with the illness, monitored traffic into their village and modified their burial practices. Still, for many, long-trusted herbalists offer a better choice than strangers in a hospital miles from home. &quot;Nobody wants to be viewed as disease carriers rather than human beings,&quot; said Frankfurter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International teams have started training local volunteers in how to keep safe. The volunteers then return to their own communities. But in a climate of fear, simple miscommunications have had unexpected results. Residents in one village were told not to shake hands in greeting as it could spread the illness. They took on board the advice, but for weeks machete-wielding youths inexplicably barred health workers from coming into the village. &quot;I'd go and I'd wave, just to try to break the ice, and they'd throw stones at me,&quot; said one international health worker. A team of locals were eventually uncovered the problem: the community considered waving a form of greeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dripping sweat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this climate, the burial teams never know what reception awaits them in each village. Today they get dressed under the silent gaze of encircling residents. All are dripping sweat inside their suits by the time they've finished. Two dogs doze in afternoon heat. Shaded by a tree in front of Mami Lamy's house, women sifting rice in palm frond baskets scuttle out of the way as the team approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to finish this in 30 minutes because of the heat,&quot; James says, his voice muffled through the layers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the dim light of her tiny home, Lamy looks like one of the rice-sifters taking a short nap. She wears a pink flowered shirt, and white head wrap. The team begin spraying a concentrated chlorine solution. They spray before each step. They spray the window, and open it. They turn her body. One arm is lifted, sprayed. Then the other. The red flowered blanket covering her is pulled down, sprayed as each inch is rolled down. The smell of chlorine fills the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In slow motion, James leans over the woman's body and takes a swab from her mouth. Holding the sample with two fingers, he drops it into a bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visibly exhausted, goggles fogging up with each breath, the team lift the body, place it in a body bag, spray, seal the bag, spray again, and repeat the whole process. At last they emerge carrying the body. A wail shatters the silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crying descends into angry confrontation at the freshly dug grave site on the village outskirts. The locals who have dug the grave refuse to pour in the mould. If the job is so unsafe, one man shouts, gesturing at the workers now stripped down to blue aprons, why haven't they been paid too?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes some 45 minutes to resolve the dispute, and that's a success. Two days ago, villagers stood on the side of the road calling out, &quot;Don't bring Ebola here!&quot; and hurled stones at the team. Once, the worst day Jusson recalls of countless burials, they lugged a bagged corpse for two miles through the forest to a grave site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10pm that night, James was back in the fluorescent glow of his office. On his to-do list: ordering more supplies, getting a broken car repaired, and scheduling a visit to the police station. One of the boys had just called to say his flatmates had kicked him out, a discrimination now punishable by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was good news elsewhere. A friend who had avoided Jusson for weeks called to say he was starting to &quot;believe&quot; his work now. Could they meet sometime so he could explain how to avoid falling sick?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola epidemic can be stopped in its tracks, but it will take at least six to nine months and cost more than $600m (&pound;366m), according to the director general of the World Health Organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Washington, senior WHO leaders, including director general Dr Margaret Chan, called for a massive global response to the outbreak, suggesting it would take longer to control than has been assumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak, said Chan, is &quot;the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen&quot;, and spreading at a pace that outstrips efforts to control it. Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone have between them reported about 3,500 cases and 1,900 deaths. The latest spread is to Port Harcourt in Nigeria, where it is likely that the virus will have been transmitted to many people from an infected doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr David Nabarro, UN coordinator for the Ebola response, said the UN system is working on 12 steps for the global response, which he estimated will cost at least $600m and require &quot;several thousand people to scale up our response by three to four times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urgent needs include communications and messaging, care for the infected and proper burials, health services for other conditions, transport and supplies, cash to pay health workers, air and sea access, and strong coordination to avert economic downturns, says WHO.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Bartuah</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1578 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is formulated in a normal situation, or in an emergency setting, the object of any public policy emanating from a democratic governing structure ought to be pragmatic. That is, such policy ought to ultimately be for the maximum benefit of the maximum number of people in a given society. Because the security, wellbeing and happiness of the people are paramount in a democracy, policy makers are urged to be circumspect in formulating whatever policy, with the view that any policy framework set into motion must be seemed to help rather than harm the people whose welfare such a policy seeks to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the positive features of a democracy-driven policy formulation is that it has never been sacrosanct; policy makers often strive to leave no stone unturned by going through the conventional policy circles in order to ensure that such a policy resonates with the people, who are the targeted beneficiaries. When a typical policy is being implemented, a concomitant monitoring process is also initiated to assess how such policy is impacting the lives of the very people for whom such a policy was intended. If an assessment indicates that a particular policy is not yielding the desired outcome, policy makers must humbly exercise flexibility by readjusting such policy, in order to benefit the largest number of people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the pitfalls of policy implementation involves policy makers arrogantly perceiving their policy as a sort of gospel that is not susceptible to any form of adjustment. In such scenario, the pragmatic acumen of public policy tends to be eroded, because the object of such policy ceases to be about the promoting the interests of the people; instead, it becomes perverted to the extent that promoting policy makers' ego becomes the centerpiece. Such policy distortions tend to be prevalent in elitist, vertical policy formulation as compared to pluralistic or horizontal approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas a policy formulated in a normal environment might afford the luxury of long-term implementation before evaluation, it is imperative that emergency public policies be frequently evaluated for needed readjustments so that an unintended harm is not inadvertently inflicted on the targeted beneficiaries for whom a policy is designed. A frequent evaluation is necessary because emergency decisions tend to be made in a rash fashion; at times decision makers are carried away by their emotion and they tend to give less thought to certain decisions they are taking. Besides that, even with the best of intention, at times the proverbial devil is in the details. That is, the primary objective of a policy might be starkly pragmatic, but the manner in which such policy is being implemented, coupled with the capability, orientations and best practice dynamics as far the implementing agents' expertise and approaches are concerned might lead to such a policy yielding adversarial consequences or undesirable results. The environment in which a policy is being implemented also plays a key role in its success or failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically in Liberia, we have had some clumsy vertical rather than horizontal approaches to policy formulation and implementation; we have an overly-centralized vertical approach, which might be a formidable impediment to implementing a fast-track policy such as the on-going Ebola awareness and prevention campaign. For example, if Monrovia had a democratic governing structure whereby the city mayor and city councilors are duly elected in a vibrant democracy, each city councilor would have taken the lead in mobilizing his or her constituency. This means that the national government would have easily interacted with the people through the Monrovia city government and the various local governments throughout the country. Had such democratic structure been in place, perhaps the terrifying incident in West Point several days ago in which in another precious life was lost wouldn't have happened; the militarization seems to be generating fear, as indicated by false &quot;attack&quot; alarm that sent Ganta amok a couple of weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As already indicated, those who set the agenda in policy formulation must themselves have a better grasp of the prevailing situation. With all due respect to our security forces, the current crisis in Liberia is primarily a health crisis; our country is not under invasion by enemy forces from outside. It is therefore obviously prudent that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare takes the lead in the national anti-Ebola campaign rather than other agencies that know little or nothing about healthcare delivery. Since the situation has reached a crisis point, mobilizing the entire government machinery to tackle the problem head on is commendable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such mobilization should not be at the expense of dedicated health workers who actually deserve tremendous motivation for their heroic courage. Other ministries such as the Defense, Justice and Internal Affairs should play auxiliary roles to the Health Ministry, instead of leading the charge, which seems to be an ineffective policy at this point in time. Most Liberians still have vivid memories of the devastating war years when we were subjected to all forms of horror. Having been traumatized during the war years, people are most likely to be apprehensive about any form of militarization, or any episode of martial antics. Moreover, historically, Liberian security forces--whether the police or the army--have most often not been known for displaying people-friendly characteristics, or cultivating exemplary community policing orientations. Such fundamental law enforcement deficiencies at times manifest themselves in the form of unnecessary hostilities against unarmed civilians or excessive use of force. Even in instances where force is not being physically applied, the public demeanor of our security forces most often tend to inspire fear and intimidation in the people rather than giving them a sense of safety and assurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against such dismal backdrop, a massive deployment of stern-faced security forces in the wake of a menacing epidemic is likely to further escalate societal trauma and drive the people into desperation and despondence. One of the negative effects of such militarization policy is that when a people are driven to despair, some of them might resort to irrational actions which might ultimately be inimical to the interest of society. Since security officers are themselves not conversant with the basics of healthcare delivery, the rigidity of their enforcement mechanism might inadvertently turn out to be counter-productive to the objective of the very policy of containment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though ours is not a sophisticated society to have grief and motivation counselors deployed, almost all health workers know some basics of psychology. Based on their training, orientations and experiences over the years, health workers are most likely to adopt a people-friendly, reassuring approach in their communication with a population already traumatized by mounting calamity as compared to security officers, some of whom might be unnecessarily panicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Ebola crisis escalated, a flurry of goodwill and empathy seem to be streaming from all over the world towards Liberia and the other two Mano River Union countries severely impacted by this epidemic. Liberian communities in many parts of the world have been mobilizing material and financial resources to help stamp out this deadly virus. For example, even when some Liberian government officials were still publicly doubting the existence of Ebola, the Nigerian Government, through President Goodluck Jonathan, reportedly noted $500,000 towards the anti-Ebola campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these financial and material resources, which are primarily intended to ensure the health and wellbeing of the poor masses, must be prudently utilized for the betterment of the Liberian society. Sincere and honest effort must be made this time around to ensure that this menacing health crisis is again not being used by unscrupulous elements in our midst to enrich themselves at the expense of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, healthcare workers deserve some financial and material incentives such as food items for their families in addition to the steady supply of protective gear; such motivational incentives are needed to enable healthcare workers redouble their efforts in saving more lives. Local and expatriate health workers must be given the opportunity to set the policy agenda under the auspices of the Health Ministry rather than security forces setting the agenda for pecuniary gains. More quarantine centers should be set up throughout the country and such centers should be constantly supplied with sufficient food items in order to attract potential Ebola patients. It is morally reprehensible to tell a man to sit and wait for a 21-day monitoring process without providing his basic needs. Finally, since Liberia does not have a democratically-elected local governing structure, community leaders, opinion leaders and leaders of civil society organizations must be involved in the prevention effort. In the end, civil approach will gradually de-escalate or mitigate the fear factor in the Ebola prevention campaign rather than a policy of militarization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In continuation of its financial support to the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the country, the Liberia Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI) Thursday made two separate cash donations of US$11,500 to the Ebla Trust Fund and Montserrado County Representative Saah H. Joseph respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US$10,000 of the money was given to the Ebola Trust Fund recently established by the government of Liberia to coordinate financial contributions from internal and external sources to fight the virus, while US$1,500 was given to Representative Joseph to enhance the running of his ambulances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LBDI President John B.S. Davies, III, said the US$11,500 is part of the bank's way in buttressing government's and Rep. Joseph's efforts in fighting the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davies said LBDI is obligated to buttressing efforts required to ensure the survivability of the country and its citizens in such a difficult time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LBDI President said the bank was moved to identify with Rep Joseph due to his humanitarian services in using his private ambulances to attend to emergency Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Montserrado County Representative had shown a high degree of humanity by voluntarily transporting suspected Ebola patients to treatment centers as well as suspected Ebola dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LBDI President hopes that although meager, the money will help to continue fuelling his ambulances and take care of some of the logistical needs while offering humanitarian services toward the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davies further said the US$10,000 donation to the Ebola Trust Fund is in addition to the US$9,000 recently donated by LBDI on behalf of the Bankers Association of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LBDI President said to further buttressing government's effort to combat the Ebola virus, the bank has given the Ministry of Health free service charge on all Ebola accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the money, Deputy Finance and Development Planning Minister for Fiscal Affairs, Dr. James Kollie thanked LBDI for the donation and noted that it will help government fight the virus which continues to kill Liberians and foreign nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister Kollie said the donation demonstrates that the bank has been a true partner to the Liberian government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter who witnessed the exercise at the police headquarters said the testing took effect Thursday, September 4, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As our reporter passed on the grounds of the police headquarters Thursday on his way to his assignment at the Temple of Justice, an officer of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) instructed that no one passes through the gates without washing hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, as the reporter completed the washing of his hands, this is what a second officer told him: &quot;old man, don't go, we have not finished with you yet, come under the booth for testing whether or not you are infected with the Ebola virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the reporter moved toward the booth, the police officer brought a white temperature testing instrument. Others individuals who were passing by way of the LNP headquarters to get at their respective locations also underwent the Ebola screening process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officers were asked what they will do if anyone is positive, he replied: that person will be quarantined and sent to the Ebola Treatment Center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of West Point Ebola Awareness team has described the Township as the 'heartbeat' of all commercial activities in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. William Dennis said his assertion is proven by the resumption of normal commercial activities in the populated Waterside Market and the reopening of stores in Monrovia and parts adjacent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We play important role when it comes to business in Central Monrovia... West Point is an economic terrain, so if cutoff from Monrovia, not only the people here will suffer; some people in central Monrovia will feel the pinch as well... &quot; Mr. Dennis said Wednesday when he spoke to a team of LMC/IREX embedded journalists in the Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dennis said during the period of the ten days quarantining of the township, stores and other business activities were completely paralyzed in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that following the lifting of the restriction, prices of basic commodities that were hiked in the Township are gradually dropping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis disclosed that fishermen have now commenced their regular fishing expedition to supply the market with fish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a pile of pepper that was sold for LD$50.00 during the quarantine period is now sold for L$25.00, while the prices of water, fish and other basic commodities are gradually being reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman informed members of the press that residents of the township have come to the realization that Ebola is real, even though no case of the virus has been found in the area thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the period of the quarantine, commercial activities in Waterside, one of the busy commercial districts in Monrovia, were seen completely paralyzed with most stores and other business centers in parts of Monrovia closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, John Nbayoh, a tracing officer in the Township, stated that even though the residents are collaborating with the government through the National Ebola Taskforce, the response process still remains slow and challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petty trader in the township, Lidy Tallawford informed journalists that some people still doubt the existence of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only solution is to prevent themselves, whether they believe or not, let they prevent themselves... &quot; Madam Tallawford said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents, including men, women and children were seen in various queues to receive food and other rations from the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and other donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Martu, a resident of the township said the process was ongoing smoothly with no form of violence, unlike when the process first started.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">483 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberia-based Pan-African Initiative has been launched in Monrovia with a mandate to help make Africa a safe continent from the ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group was launched early this week by opposition politician Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh. The initiative, called Servants of Africa Fighting Ebola (SAFE), has a principal objective of making Africa safe from ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of SAFE gives highest priority to Liberia because, according to Dr. Tipoteh, Liberia is globally considered as being the country that is now experiencing the most dangerous ebola attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his launching statement, Dr. Tipoteh said that present phase of the ebola attack started in Guinea in March of this year and ebola has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo within Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ebola spread has attacked countries outside of Africa, as in Saudi Arabia and Sweden with threat to spread to more countries. Dr. Tipoteh pointed out that this ebola spread has to be stopped immediately, as it has now become a threat to national and international security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh indicated that the organizers/Advisory Board Members come from various parts of Africa with over forty years of experiences in the planning and implementation of People-to-People activities throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that these experiences are most important because SAFE is a People's Organization, to be working to stop ebola by using the people-to-people approach where the people take ownership of the activities of SAFE in making non-physical contacts through village and town criers, the mass media and the social media of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2011 presidential candidate stressed that the guarantee for the campaign to stop ebola is the participation of the people in decision-making and their attendant ownership of the anti-ebola activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAFE is based in Liberia with the following persons, mentioned by Dr. Tipoteh, as being the headquarters Organizers/Advisory Board Members: Dr. Mary Nema Brownell, Founding Chairperson, the Liberia Women Initiative and Founding Member of the Mano River Women Peace Network; Rev. Dr. Arthur Flomo Kulah, Bishop (retired) of the United Methodist Church who served as Bishop in Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone; Sheikh Kafumba Konneh, President of the Inter-Religious Council of Liberia and Chairman of the National Muslim Council of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are Frances Greaves, National Chairperson of the National Civil Society Council of Liberia; and Prof. Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh, Founding Leader of the Movement for Justice in Africa (MOJA) and Founding Chairperson of the Erstwhile Interest Groups of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In closing Statement, Dr. Tipoteh expressed condolences to the families of all of the people who have died from ebola and called upon all Africans and friends of Africa to work together to stop ebola so that the deaths of the victims of ebola would not have been in vain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac has dispelled rumors about the cancellation of the issuance of American visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been filtering rumors that the United States Government cut off the issuance of American visa due to the Ebola outbreak. Addressing a roundtable media interaction Tuesday in Monrovia, Ambassador Malac explained that the information is incorrect because cancellation of visa and restriction of travels are not the best ways in fighting the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), which is now considered as the worse outbreak in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac said contrary to such rumors, the United States Embassy is opened and fully operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. envoy noted that the Embassy is fully staffed in assisting the Liberian government and citizens to collectively contain the spread of the virus which continues to kill people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there are still Liberians, Guineans and Sierra Leoneans who are going to the United States during this Ebola period and nobody has been stopped from traveling. According to her, the only measure put in place by the Embassy in collaboration with airport authorities is the screening of individuals for fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac told the media gathering that besides the usual visa requirements which applicants are to meet, the process has not been cut-off because there is no medical reason for that. &quot;There is no reason to close borders; there is no reason to prevent travelers from other countries,&quot; she indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac further said the U.S. Embassy remains active in the country and continues to play its usual role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She disclosed that the United States has committed more than US$21 million to combat the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa since its outbreak was first reported in March 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the latest funding of $1.7 million will be used for the provision of direct food assistance to Ebola patients in Liberia through World Food Program (WFP).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a month after two American doctors were treated in the United States with the experimental drugs ZMapp, there are reports that another American doctor has contracted the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post Newspaper reported that an American physician working in Liberia has been tested positive for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper quoted the missionary organization SIM USA as saying that the unidentified doctor was treating obstetrics patients at the ELWA hospital when he contracted the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A release quotes the missionary organization SIM USA as saying that the doctor was not working with Ebola patients in the hospital's isolation center unit when he got infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization said the American doctor isolated himself soon after it was shown that he was developing symptoms. He has been transferred to the Ebola isolation unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the third American doctor to get infected with the deadly virus in Liberia. In August, two American doctors, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were flown to the United States, where they were given the experimental drug at Emory University Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Brantly and Writebol have fully recovered after the drug was shown to be 100% effective. In Liberia, three medical practitioners were also treated with the ZMapp drug and recovered as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the deadly Ebola virus which is ravaging member states of the Mano River Union (MRU) and now Nigeria, a group of concerned leading healthcare practitioners from the medical campus of the University of Massachusetts (UMass) in Worcester and the Boston's Children Hospital are collaborating with Liberian community organizations in Massachusetts to dispatch a huge consignment of needed protective gear to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRU, a sub-regional economic grouping, comprises Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. As for Nigeria, its known contact with Ebola was due to treating an infected Liberian, Patrick Sawyer, who had traveled to that country for an ECOWAS--Economic Community of West African States--summit. So far, three deaths have been reported from Nigeria and all victims were health workers who apparently had direct contact with Mr. Sawyer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a mass meeting on August 10th with members of the Liberian community of Metro Boston at the 12th Baptist Church on 160 Warren Street in Roxbury, Dr. Patricia McQuilkin, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at UMass-Worcester named surgical gloves, gowns and masks as some of the protective gear needed by healthcare workers in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She disclosed that as a result of an existing partnership involving her medical school, Boston Children's Hospital, other medical institutions and the Health Education and Relief through Teaching (HEARTT), a U.S.-based non-governmental organization, they had in the past six years, made two shipments to the Health Ministry in Liberia, to help medical institutions in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said because they had already been involved in helping Liberian health workers and they already have storage facilities in place, so with the Ebola crisis, they decided to collaborate with Liberian organizations in Massachusetts in order to help their colleagues in Liberia, adding, &quot;We have received 2,000 pounds of donation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. McQuilkin said while her partnership grouping is still soliciting protective materials, it is equally urging Liberians and friends of Liberia to make financial contributions that will help underwrite the cost of additional shipment, which will be made at the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. McQuilkin, who is also a Visiting Professor of Pediatrics at the A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine at the University of Liberia, lamented that many healthcare workers in Liberia are being exposed to the deadly virus, partly due to the lack of, or insufficiency of those essential protective materials. As a Visiting Professor, Dr. McQuilkin normally shuttles between Worcester and Monrovia at least twice a year, based on a partnership agreement between UMass-Worcester and the University of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking further, the leading pediatrician said the Liberian Government, through the Health Ministry, has also sent out SOS--save-our-souls--appeals for disposable aprons, body bags, goggles, rubber boots and sanitizer. Other items the Health Ministry in Monrovia is in dire need of as it fiercely combats Ebola include chlorine pellets, adhesive tapes, antibiotics, IV fluids and no-touch thermometers, Dr. McQuilkin emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are affiliated with a hospital or health care organization, many of the companies that supply surgical gloves, gowns, masks, etc to your hospital may want to make a donation of supplies for Liberia&quot;, the American medic told members of the Liberian community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also urged Liberians to use the social media--Facebook, Twitter, etc--in creating public awareness among their brethren back home about the need to heed precautionary advisory from health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. McQuilkin has identified three web addresses belonging to Medicine Sans Frontier and HEARTT for financial donation, with a caveat that reference be made to Save-Liberian-Healthcare Lives Workers Campaign. The web addresses are as follows: http://igg.ne/at/savinghealthcareworkerslives, www.doctorswithoutborders.org and http://hearttfoundation.org.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Support Unit (PSU) officer (named withheld) whose wife reportedly died from the deadly Ebola virus has been transferred to the Ebola Treatment Center at ELWA Hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Officer was taken to the treatment center Tuesday, September 2, 2014, days after his wife died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports that following the death of the officer's wife, their son began to show signs of the virus and was taken at the treatment center where he later died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told this paper Wednesday that their elder daughter also contracted the virus from the son. The sources said the daughter was asked to tote her brother from the Barracks on board a vehicle to the treatment center in the presence of the Ebola Response Team, something which may have caused the girl to contract the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girl, who was earlier taken to the Ebola Treatment Center at ELWA Hospital is said to be undergoing treatment along with her father (police officer).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The building which hosted the PSU officer and his family is still being quarantined. The building accommodates about 17 officers of the Police Support Unit (PSU) along with their respective families. The wife of the Ebola suspected PSU officer was a health worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest report gathered by the NEWS Tuesday indicates that the Ebola suspected building has been separated from the rest of the other buildings with barbe wire as occupants have been told not to leave the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) who visited the Police Barracks Monday, advised LNP authorities to keep surveillance on the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source hinted that the CDC further advised that no treatment should be administered until signs and symptoms of Ebola are shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-Ebola materials have been sent to the quarantined officers as LNP administration put in place measures to provide 24 hour electricity to the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, LNP has intensified its anti-Ebola campaign. Temperature testing equipment is placed at the entrance of the Police headquarters where officers, support staffers and visitors are screened before entering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the second in a series of outreach programs being executed by the LNP. Two weeks ago, Police Director Chris Massaquoi visited West Point to spread messages of hope as well as provide tips on how to prevent the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">678 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rapidity at which the Ebola virus is spreading across the West African sub-region has attracted the attention of the global community with the United Nations echoing that the disease is &quot;critically serious and deeply worrying&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said the fear factor plays a strong role in the crisis. He urged member states of the UN, businesses and individuals to take decisions based on scientific evidence, not on fear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that misinformation about Ebola can only exacerbate an already dire or fragile situation in the impacted countries and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson made the statement on Tuesday, September 3, 2014 at a meeting with member states on Ebola at the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Eliasson said although only a few countries have been affected, three of them severely, other countries are increasingly concerned, rightly so, about the possibility of further spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that the health systems in the affected countries (Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) are overwhelmed by the magnitude and complexity of the problems, noting that the affected nations are finding it extremely difficult to cope with the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, the international community, must now step up our efforts and boost the capacity of the affected countries and their systems and provide all support needed,&quot; Deputy Secretary General Eliasson appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He informed the world body that considering the number of infections and deaths, the outbreak is more than a health crisis and that it has already taken a disproportionate toll on economies and affected the daily life and the very fabric of families and societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as the United Nations is concerned, this is one of the most serious health challenges we have ever faced. The reality on the ground is no different from those caused by natural calamities and conflicts of great magnitude -- and in some ways even more difficult with dire consequences in several other areas of society. At the country level, an enormous amount of work is already being done by the United Nations Missions, peacekeeping operations and United Nations country teams,&quot; the Deputy Secretary stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said the UN cannot do it alone, that it needs effective strategies, partnerships and capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we cannot do it alone. We need effective strategies, partnerships, and capacities. There cannot be any weak links in this operational chain. We also need to think in unconventional terms and demonstrate speed and flexibility in defining and executing our strategies. We are faced with severe strains on our own staff working in these difficult conditions. We may need to involve Member States in this coordination task. I recall the tsunami in South-East Asia and the Haiti earthquake when we had a more active role of Member States in those operations,&quot; Mr. Eliasson pleaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the Secretary-General has established a United Nations System on Ebola virus disease coordination mechanism to ensure that it offer integrated support to affected countries, while helping to prevent spread to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This coordination mechanism, he added, will be guided by the leadership provided by WHO and by its Ebola Response Roadmap. Dr. David Nabarro, who has just returned from visiting the affected countries, will, as Senior United Nations Coordinator, ensures effective United Nations system-wide response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eliasson: &quot;There have been strong responses by Governments, multilateral and regional organisations, United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and other partners. I thank them for their support but encourage them to do more and to do so rapidly. I particularly want to commend MSF for their quick and solid response. I would also like to particularly thank the Governments of those affected countries for their political will and determination to come to grips with the problem. Financial resources and a unique mix of capacities to come into those countries are needed immediately so that the spread of the disease can be contained rapidly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight against the eradication of the deadly Ebola virus in the country continues to gain massive support from construction companies, agencies, international partners as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) since its outbreak early this year in Lofa County, northern Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease, since its outbreak, has claimed the lives of several hundreds of Liberians leaving sorrow in their homes. Family members, whose love ones have been taken away by the infection, continue to mourn in memory of them as efforts are being made at all fronts to eradicate the disease in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the companies and organizations involved with the fight against the eradication of the deadly infection in the country are SSF Entrepreneur Incorporated and MSF, an aid and medical organization. These two organizations are collaborating to build the ELWA quarantine center outside Monrovia which is designated by the government to place suspected Ebola patients under observation for the period of 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SSF management told newsmen early this week that it is not involved with the establishment of the ELWA quarantine center for political reason or recognition, but it said it is involved with such work owing to the fact that Liberia is being faced with a pandemic, making investment and development activities to come to abnormal stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, the company said, was worrisome and troubling adding, there is a need for every Liberian, institution, company and agency to join the fight against eradication of the infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are doing this work because it is necessary for us to do such given the situation we are nationally faced with. This is our own way of helping the government and our people,&quot; Joseph Fallah, an engineer from SSF, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's management further stated that being a Liberian business and while it carries out its operations in the country, it is traditionally binding on it to swiftly respond to the outbreak of any natural disaster threatening the lives of the people. &quot;Such forms part of our corporate social responsibility,&quot; management added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A medical officer from MSF, who preferred anonymity, said his organization is in Liberia to help with the fight against the eradication of Ebola. He told newsmen that MSF is mainly concerned about saving the lives of Liberians, saying that in this direction it would do all that is possible to make the country free from the spread of the infection and that its people gain confidence in public health, while they return to normal way of life in a reasonable period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He revealed that strategies are being primed to adequately respond to the epidemic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PricewaterhouseCoopers, (PWC) Liberia, an international auditing firm with a branch in Liberia has made a cash contribution of one thousand United States dollars to the Town Center Community located in the Township of New Georgia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation, which was made on Friday, August 29, 2014 when community and the collection of youth organizations under the banner Association of Youth Organization launched anti-Ebola awareness, is in support of efforts being exerted by the National Taskforce, businesses, private and public financial institutions, international and local non-governmental organizations to contain the Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) that is ravaging Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the contribution on behalf of PWC, Mr. Tweh Tommy said it was the company's way of helping the community during this period of national emergency where everyone is endeavoring to stand up to the fatal Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PWC official thanked the Council of Elders and the Youth Association of the community for the farsightedness in undertaking such anti-Ebola initiative, adding &quot;the battle against Ebola can only be won collectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called on others to emulate the example of his institution by making financial and material contributions to the National Taskforce or communities that are aiding the efforts of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to PWC-Liberia's gesture, Rev. James Togba who spoke on behalf of the community thanked the entity for coming to the aid of the community dwellers as they buttress the efforts of the government through the National Taskforce to beat back Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they do not have any confirmed or suspected Ebola cases in their areas, Rev. Togba said it was necessary to take preventive measures, and added that &quot;the success of the anti-Ebola campaign was based on the contribution made by the PWC and individuals in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are overwhelmed and very appreciative that PWC, regardless of the short notice, was able to reach us, enabling us to take the messages and preventive measures to our people,&quot; Rev. Togba said. &quot;The amount will be used for the intended purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, called on the Government of Liberia, the business communities, local and international partners to take the Ebola fight to community level, and noted that proactive actions at the community levels will ensure success against the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 3,069 persons have been infected with the virus with 1,552 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria as of August 26, 2014, the World Health Organization says in its latest report on the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight out of Liberia's 15 registered political parties have called on President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to outsource the functions of the National Ebola Task Force to private institutions that are knowledgeable and experienced in disease control and prevention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties believe that if this is done, it would ensure effectiveness. In a joint communiqu&eacute;, the political parties said there are indications that challenges to eradicate the Ebola virus disease from the country have outweighed the National Task Force headed by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The eight political parties said instead of the President heading the Task Force, the government should be receiving report from these private institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties include Union of Liberian Democrat (ULD), Alliance for Peace and Democracy (APD), National Patriotic Party (NPP), Grassroots Democratic Party of Liberia (GDPL), Movement for Progressive Change (MPC), Victory Change (VCP), Liberia Transformation Party (LTP) and People's Unification Party (PUP). With regards to the state of emergency and curfew, the eight collaborating political parties resolved that it remains in enforced, but called for an adjustment in the curfew time from 11 pm - 6 am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties also agreed with government's stance on restricting people's movement, describing it as a workable tool in containing the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the state of emergency and curfew, the parties want the government to provide increased technical and logistical support to the Liberia National Police to beef up their presence in the communities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the scare of Ebola and the subsequent quarantining of the Dolo Town Community, the Police Community outreach team on Tuesday, September 2 visited Dolo Town near Harbel to provide reassurance to the people that all efforts will be made by the government to cater to their needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the second in a series of outreach programs being executed by Police authorities after a successful launch in West Point two weeks ago to spread the message of hope and to provide tips to residents on how to prevent contracting the deadly Ebola Virus. The Police convoy was greeted by jubilant residents who lined the routes to the Market center to welcome the Inspector General and delegation as well as listen to the message.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a brief ceremony, Police Inspector-General, C. Clarence Massaquoi, who led an array of senior officers, and accompanied by the Head of the United Nations Mission Police in Liberia (UNPOL) Commissioner Gregory Hinds said the government was concerned about their plight and would do anything to provide the much needed humanitarian assistance while they are being quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector General Massaquoi said the Police was delighted to visit the area as part of its community outreach programme to engage in public awareness on the prevention and spread of the deadly Ebola Virus that has caused the community to be quarantined by the Liberian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our presence is to show that we love you and will not abandon you&quot;, Police Inspector General Massaquoi told the enthusiastic crowd as he distributed Ebola and Crime Prevention materials to the community of Dolo Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Boss used the occasion to remind that they have a responsibility to ensure that the community is free of the deadly virus by listening to advice of Health Workers and engaging in activities that would curtail the further spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government and its International Partners are doing all in their power to fight this deadly Ebola Virus, but it is also incumbent upon you, the residents of Dolo's Town to also make sure that you cooperate in the fight&quot;. We all have to fight to kick Ebola out of Liberia&quot; drawing the crowd to chant in support. He said the Police will remain engaged with the various communities in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police presented thermometers, safety gloves, and dozens of T-shirts with inscriptions of Ebola messages, symptoms and preventative measures. In Special remark, the UNPOL Commissioner of Police spoke the UMNIL commitment to assist the Liberian Government in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the UN Police is working collaboratively with their Liberian National Police in ensuring that the mandate of the Police was implemented without hindrance. UNPOL recently donated six Nissan 4x4 Jeeps to the LNP for deployment in communities severely affected by the Ebola scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Margibi County Statutory District # 2 Superintendent Henric Marcus Speare welcomed The Police Hierarchy to the township and expressed gratitude that the Inspector General Massaquoi and his team of Senior Officers had come to the town to identify with the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in a show of support for the Inspector Massaquoi and the Police efforts, a local charity, Crowd '50 donated an assortment of food items valued at over two thousand United States Dollars to the Dolo's Town residents. The items included 50 bags of 25kg of rice, 20 three-gallon of vegetable oil, four bags of 50kg of sugar, two bags of flour and 150 sacks of mineral water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of Crowd '50, Samuel Wonwi Thompson said his organization support to the residents was a way of identifying with their plight and to boost Police efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in addition to their official mandate of protecting life and property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowd '50 was founded in the 1980's by Liberian men born in the 1950's from various professional backgrounds to cater the needs to Liberians nationwide. Responding, various speakers representing the religious, youth and other groups hailed the Police for the gesture and their continuing protection. They described the Police as a friend of the community who was also ready and willing to render assistance to them when called upon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberian-based Pan-African Initiative to stop Ebola was launched this week by Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh. The initiative is called Servants of Africa Fighting Ebola (SAFE). The principal objective of SAFE is to make Africa safe from Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of SAFE gives highest priority to Liberia because, according to Dr. Tipoteh, Liberia is globally considered as being the Country that is now experiencing the most dangerous Ebola attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Launching Statement, Dr. Tipoteh said that the present phase of the Ebola attack started in Guinea in March of this year and Ebola has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo within Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola spread has attacked countries outside of Africa, as in Saudi Arabia and Sweden with threat to spread to more countries. Dr. Tipoteh pointed out that this Ebola spread has to be stopped immediately, as it has now become a threat to national and international security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh indicated that the Organizers/Advisory Board Members come from various parts of Africa with over forty years of experiences in the planning and implementation of People-to-People activities throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that these experiences are most important because SAFE is a People's Organization, to be working to stop Ebola by using the people-to-people approach where the people take ownership of the activities of SAFE in making non-physical contacts through the village and town criers, the mass media and the social media of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh, in his Launching Statement, stressed that the guarantee for the campaign to stop Ebola is the participation of the people in decision-making and their attendant ownership of the anti-Ebola activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward B. Palmer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">504 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Kru County Legislative Caucus over the weekend made a donation of several assorted food items to inhabitants of the West Point Community. The food items included 50 (25kg) bags of rice, 40 gallons of vegetable oil, two bags of flour, 100 sacs of mineral water, a cartoon of sardines among other assorted items were donated by the caucus' Chairperson, Senator Cletus C. Wotorson on behalf of the lawmakers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Senator Wotorson, the donation of the items to the people of West Point is the caucus' way of buttressing the government's efforts at fighting the deadly Ebola virus out of the country. Senator Wotorson asserted that the outbreak of the Ebola virus, which led to the subsequent quarantining of the community, is a strange happening that people do not understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Kru County Senator recalled that the outbreak of the Ebola virus since early March this year has caused the deaths of several doctors and nurses and expressed fears that this had caused the profession to be abandoned. For this reason, the Grand Kru lawmaker and his colleagues have mustered the courage to make its own contribution to the people of West Point as a sign of identifying with the community during its time of quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cautioned Liberians to adhere to measures put in place by health workers in order to eradicate the existence of the virus in as much as the outbreak of Ebola is a strange phenomenon in the country. As he regretted the quarantining of the West Point Community, urging community dwellers everywhere in the country to be patient and allow to this period of Liberia's trying time to expire so that life can return to normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making further comment on the donation was the caucus' Vice Chair, Sen. Peter Coleman, who expressed happiness over identifying with his people. Sen. Coleman said their visit in the community was overdue, but added that there could have been no better time to do it than the time of their visit. He explained that the outbreak of the virus was Liberians' fault, saying that the outbreak is a sign of warning from God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admittedly, Sen. Coleman noted that the Ebola virus is killing more people and assumed that more people are yet to die from the virus. According to Sen. Coleman, what is happening in West Point shows that the government is robust in trying to illuminate the prevalence of the virus, adding that what is happening in a suspected outbreak area can happen anywhere once there is a suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is obtaining here shows that government is not alone in its fight,&quot; the Grand Kru Senator and former Minister of Health &amp; Social Welfare said, adding that there are other partners who have the community at heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the virus is not in Grand Kru, Coleman, also a medical practitioner said massive awareness is being carried out so as to prepare the citizens for any potential outbreak He then concluded by urging the citizens of West Point to remain calm, noting that their community is not the only community that is being quarantined as a result of Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism, Lewis G. Brown, II, has praised the government and people of the United states for the numerous contributions that country has made in Liberia in assisting in the fight against the deadly Ebola viral disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extolling the United States for its assistance towards Liberia's anti-Ebola efforts, Minister Brown said that the U.S. Military has trained 230 Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) Personnel on the proper use of the personal protective equipment (PPE), the safe handling of patients, securing health sites, escorting humanitarian and medical personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing journalists at the ministry's regular Ebola update briefings, Minister Brown said the training is part of &quot;U.S. Onward Liberty&quot;, a five-year program run by the U.S. Department of State and Defense to support and strengthen the Armed Forces of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown said the Government and people of Liberia are grateful to the United States for the supports, noting that Liberia is equally appreciative to friendly governments, including the Government of Sweden, which recently donated several tons of disinfectants and other medical supplies to the government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MICAT boss further lauded the Government of the People's Republic of China, which the minister noted was the first country to have responded to the Ebola situation in Liberia and for their generous contributions of over US$1.7 million worth of consignment to Liberia towards the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown said the Ebola Treatment Response Agency (ETRA) of the Defense Department in charge of countering weapons of mass destruction provided PPE to the Liberian Government, including a surgical gown, protective overalls and gloves as well as decontamination hand sprayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the fight against Ebola in Liberia, the MICAT boss recounted that the United States Government has already committed more than US$21 million to combat the disease in West Africa. Mr. Brown indicated that since the outbreak, the U.S has lifted funding amounting to US$1.7 Million that is being used to provide direct food assistance to Ebola patients in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 26-man disaster response team (DRT) is already present in the country, Sierra Leone and Guinea to oversee the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola crisis, the Information Minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Minister Brown, the Atlanta-based Control for Disease Prevention has sent more than 70 disease control experts to West Africa that are providing technical expertise to national public health institutions and agencies to help protect and prevent the spread of the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that the CDC in partnership with the Global Alert Network Response Team and the U.S. National Institute of Health has already established the second Ebola Testing Laboratory in Liberia, which he added, is a mobile testing laboratory at the ELWA Campus to short end the response time of test for patients at the largest facilities currently in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1143 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely a day after United States President Barrack Obama announced the U.S. Government's preparedness to work with West African Ebola inflicted countries, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has again assured Liberia and other afflicted countries of a comprehensive approach that would lead to the containment of the deadly Ebola viral disease from West Africa; reports The Analyst's Edwood N. Dennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since this year, three West African countries, including Guinea, Liberia and Sierra have been plagued with the Ebola pestilence, a situation which has triggered supports from international agencies and friendly nations to Liberia and other neighboring countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria lately joined the fight against Ebola adding to afflicted countries that are now getting international attention for the containment of the virus in the region. The CDC said it was stepping up its partnership to get Liberia and the rest of the sub-region out of the health nightmare, but emphasized the need for more community treatment centers and the training and engagement of local medical practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a teleconference with journalists in America and in other parts of the world, including Liberia on Wednesday, the Director for the CDC's Center for Global Health (CGH), Dr. Thomas Kenyon, has expressed confidence that the virus will be contained in Liberia and the sub-region with the present engagements of the governments and the involvement of the international partners including the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States' top disease control expert and head of the CDC further told journalists during the teleconference that Ebola outbreak in the capital cities of the affected countries was unprecedented and shocking to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that the nations of the world need to learn from the response process by both effected country's governments and the international partners. The virus, he said, is spreading rapidly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone with Liberia being the worst in the response action and approach to controlling the disease. If nothing is done, the situation would go to an alarming ratio within the borders of countries currently experiencing the outbreak, Dr. Kenyon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola disease, Dr. Kenyon explained, is preventable; &quot;I wondered how come that the virus become prevalent in capital cities of the countries.&quot; In Monrovia, Ebola has become the nightmare for the residents, ruining the social-cultural behavior of the people. Liberians' gesture of greeting has been handshake with the snap of the fingers, but this gesture has to abruptly stop due to health restrictions occasioned by the outbreak of Ebola in the country, especially in metropolitan cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billboards, fliers, broadcasts, newspaper pages and jingles are running messages, including &quot;No Touching, No Handshake... &quot; amongst others to the people, a reason for which residents become to eschew each other in the fear of transmission of the virus amongst the populace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, most Liberian dishes usually have dried meant as cherished ingredients, which is now restricted from the time of the outbreak of the Ebola virus, while they care for and mourning for relatives and love ones in time of death has also been restricted as measures against the spread of the Ebola virus which can also be contracted from monkeys and other bush meats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the teleconference, Dr. Kenyon said people should stop ignoring the facts about the danger of the virus; rather he counseled that residents should apply every serous health tip available to them in preventing the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned staying away from already sick and dead people who have shown every sign of the Ebola virus, noting that by that, the possibility of controlling the disease from spreading is achievable. He, however noted that people contacting the disease were not far from the possibility of being cured when the necessary antibiotic medication are provided and served them at the treatment centers that would be set up around the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who are treated at the treatment sites and returning in communities need to undergo a psycho-social program conducted by those with the professional qualification in psycho-source works from these nations that are under the threat of the virus,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention further noted that it was impossible for Ebola survivors to regain consciousness of living with other people without psychosocial counseling, considering the hope lost as a result of dejection experienced during their time of difficulties while suffering the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On isolation of Ebola stricken countries, Dr. Kenyon indicated that one of the best ways of preventing the virus rather than isolating nations by closing airports to travelers was proper screening and regular temperature testing of people coming and exiting the various airports and borders for other destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kenyon stressed the need for the construction of more Ebola treatment facilities in communities around the countries affected, including Liberia, as a measure of containing the virus so as to ease the problem of overcrowding of established centers provided for responding to people contacting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facilities constructed, he stressed, should always remain open and proactive to ably respond to the outbreak if Liberia (or other countries affected) and the international community are to achieve a positive mark in fighting against the Ebola virus, which according to him has now become a global threat. He accentuated that upon constructing and making operational more Ebola treatment Centers the next thing is the recruitment and training of more nurses and health workers in Liberia and other affected countries by international health organizations combating the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the fight against the Ebola virus do not really need the involvement of a large number of expatriates to do the job; the local health workers instead are suitable for taking up the responsibility and challenge when they are recruited and properly trained in handling Ebola cases and patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kenyon then concluded that it is abundantly clear that the threats the virus has posed to Liberia and the already affected countries is serious to the extent that it has made it impossible for anyone of these nations to stand alone in fighting the virus, adding that the objective of containing the virus is hardly achievable without the direct participation of the USA and other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking during the teleconference, the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director at the National Security Council, Madam Gayle Smith emphasized the USA government's commitment through bilateral engagements to work with governments in supporting the require efforts that would lead to the elimination of the virus in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British nurse infected with ebola walked out of a London hospital yesterday - free of the disease he feared would kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And William Pooley, 29, who caught the lethal virus while helping sufferers in Sierra Leone, said that to the delight of his mother, he can't return there - because his passport was incinerated amid fears it was contaminated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley, who said he felt wonderfully lucky' to have made a full recovery, talked about his ordeal in a Press conference at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been treated in an isolated tent in a sealed-off special unit since being flown to Britain by the RAF 11 days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chillingly, he first learnt he had the disease when, after falling asleep, he was awoken by a World Health Organisation doctor who did not even have to speak - because the anti-infection suit and face mask he was wearing said it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley said: I'd had a blood test in the early afternoon, then went to bed. I was woken that evening by one of the WHO doctors in full PPE [personal protection equipment], so I knew it was bad news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was worried I was going to die, I was worried about my family, I was scared.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he was going to return to West Africa, Mr Pooley said: They incinerated my passport, so my mum will be pleased to know I can't go anywhere. I'm going back to Suffolk this afternoon and I'm most looking forward to seeing people in the village, and just relaxing in the nice countryside.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse - who spent last night at his parents' home in Eyke, near Woodbridge - was modest about his decision in July to volunteer at an ebola clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: When ebola started, everyone was frightened and concerned. It was something engulfing the country, so it was just natural. I was in a place to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wouldn't change my decision. To look after people when they're really suffering - that's what being a nurse is all about.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WILLIAM POOLEY, the British nurse who contracted Ebola in West Africa, was at home with his family in Suffolk last night after recovering from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley, 29, who became infected while treating patients in Sierra Leone, said he had no plans to return to the country and joked that his mother would be pleased that his passport had been incinerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was evacuated 12 days ago by the Royal Air Force and underwent treatment in an isolation tent at the Royal Free Hospital in London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday he was discharged by doctors who said he was clear of the virus and no longer contagious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley said he had feared he would die and felt &quot;wonderfully lucky&quot; to have survived the disease, which has killed 57 per cent of sufferers in the outbreak sweeping West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am most looking forward to seeing all the rest of my family, seeing friends, seeing people in the village and just relaxing for a few days, and spending some nice time in the Suffolk countryside,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They incinerated my passport. My mum will be pleased to know that I am not going anywhere at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hasn't affected how I feel about my career. My work in Sierra Leone is a real privilege; to go to look after people when they are suffering. That's what being a nurse is all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no regrets. But I need some time. I don't know exactly what the medium term holds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,500 people have died from the disease in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria and double that number have been infected. The World Health Organisation has warned that there could be 20,000 victims before the outbreak is brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley described how he was tested for the disease after feeling sick and was woken by a doctor from the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in PPE (personal protective equipment) - I knew it was bad news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lowest point was immediately after I was told really. It suddenly hit me that I would have to tell my parents. That was the hardest thing. I was worried that I was going to die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse was flown back to Britain on August 24 and treated with the experimental drug ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suffered high temperatures and some stomach problems but avoided the worst symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised the &quot;world-class care&quot; he received at the Royal Free Hospital and thanked the Government and the RAF for getting him home so quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I was very lucky in several ways: firstly in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in West Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease - people I have seen dying horrible deaths. I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of care and the level of skilled professionalism and compassion that I received is not the same in West Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling his time in Sierra Leone, he said: &quot;I have mixed memories, some great memories and some horrible memories - lots of people dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But also some wonderful memories of people going home, people showing massive spirit and cheer, despite the horrible conditions, the truly heroic people that I worked with, people that went on to get sick, so it is a massive mix of memories.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than a week in an isolation chamber, Mr Pooley appeared in public for the first time yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the experience of being isolated, he said: &quot;It was really busy, especially for the first few days - there was lots going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was constantly doing my obs (observations). I was having fluids and blood tests, things like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I was really busy actually and I didn't have a lot of time to really ponder the full potential of the illness.&quot; He said that coming out of the isolation tent had been a &quot;special moment&quot; and expressed his gratitude to health staff who found supplies of ZMapp, which is running out across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Michael Jacobs, the infectious diseases consultant who treated Mr Pooley, said the nurse posed no contagion risk to members of the public. However, the doctor said not enough was known about the disease for him to be able to say whether Mr Pooley was now immune. He said it was likely he could still be infected by a different strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Jacobs added: &quot;The virus is clear from the body and there is no risk to the wider community in any way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley's case provides more evidence that ZMapp may be a cure for the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a study showed that the drug cured 100 per cent of monkeys who were infected with the illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley's recovery adds weight to claims that the experimental drug ZMapp can cure Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drug is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two US doctors who were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia recovered after being given the drug. The treatment reversed symptoms including excessive bleeding, rashes and liver damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or simply got lucky. About 47 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. Previous epidemics have killed more than 90 per cent of those infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley's disease was caught early and he was treated before symptoms could take hold. At least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research published last week in the journal Nature suggested that 18 rhesus monkeys infected with Ebola all made a complete recovery after being given ZMapp. Three untreated animals died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola kills by overwhelming the immune system and sending the body into shock as blood pressure drops to dangerous levels. Where ZMapp has been unavailable, management of the Ebola outbreak in Africa has been confined to palliative care and preventing transmission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first British Ebola patient, Will Pooley, said yesterday he felt &quot;wonderfully lucky&quot; to be alive after he was given the all-clear by doctors at a north London hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteer nurse was discharged yesterday morning from the isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, days after being given the experimental drug ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he feared for his life after catching the disease two weeks ago while working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was worried I was going to die,&quot; Pooley, 29, said at a press conference. &quot;I was worried about my family. I was scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he felt a &quot;kind of reprieve&quot; that others could not get in west Africa, where the Ebola epidemic has claimed more than 1,500 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking gaunt but happy, he praised the &quot;world-class&quot; treatment he had received at the hospital after being evacuated by the RAF. Asked how he felt to have pulled through from a disease that can kill within four days of symptoms showing, he replied: &quot;Wonderfully lucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Michael Jacobs, the infectious diseases consultant who led a care team of dozens, declared Pooley totally free of the virus and of no risk to others. &quot;The great thing is once someone has recovered from Ebola as Will has, (he) is no longer infectious to anyone else . . . There is no risk to the public in any way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley planned to return to his family home in Eyke, Suffolk and said he was not averse to returning to Sierra Leone where he helped treat Ebola patients. The only problem was his passport had been incinerated, something that pleased his mother, Pooley joked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was airlifted to the hospital 10 days ago, and was treated inside a plastic tent designed to isolate his care team from any contact with the virus. Pooley said the moment doctors told him &quot;the viral load had come down&quot; he knew he was over the worst. &quot;Coming out of the tent was a special moment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was fortunate his illness did not progress to the potentially deadly phase typical of Ebola including vomiting and internal bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had some unpleasant symptoms but not the worst. I never had vomiting for example,&quot; he said. &quot;I had some pretty high temperatures at times . . . I had some chills. I had some gastrointestinal symptoms as well, but nothing as bad as in west Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the lowest point of his ordeal, the nurse said it was the thought of breaking the news to loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no point when I thought 'God, I am going to die', but the thought of telling my parents - that was the worst thing. No one wants to upset their parents in that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley had been given the experimental drug ZMapp last week and said he felt this may have helped his recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a long intravenous infusion. It ran over 12 hours. We don't know - there's no real way of telling what impact it had. But a day or so after having it I was feeling a lot better,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The numbers in terms of my viral load were much improved. We don't know whether that was down to ZMapp or whether that would happen anyway,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMapp was also used on the two US doctors who recovered from Ebola but at least two others who received it as part of their treatment have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs sounded a note of caution about any plans Pooley may have to return to Sierra Leone. &quot;Will will have immunity, but I don't think we understand enough about it to say to Will that he is completely protected from Ebola in the future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley had been working in a hospital in the city of Kenema, the main centre of the Ebola outbreak, when he tested positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't change my decision to go out there, I have no regrets. I am more committed than ever to nursing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the moment he was told he had Ebola, he said he had been feeling unwell and gone home after getting a blood test. He knew the worst had happened when he was woken by a World Health Organisation nurse dressed in full protective clothing. &quot;It was a bit disturbing to get that diagnosis. I suppose I was half expecting it because I was feeling ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And immediately I was surrounded by a team of people that all they wanted to do was look out for my best interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I spoke to the high commissioner in Sierra Leone and doctors, and immediately I knew there were lots of people looking out for me and that was a massive comfort.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading tropical disease experts have called on the government to free up NHS staff to help fight Ebola, which is continuing to spread across west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof David Moor, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and two of his senior colleagues say it is incumbent on the UK to share the burden that is crippling the already weak health systems in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - the three countries worst affected by the deadly virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that in order to support the UK's response, the NHS must allow staff temporary leave of absence from their post to contribute to the global response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consultant physicians, specialty trainees, and specialist nurses in specialties including infectious diseases, microbiology, virology, public health, intensive care and infection control are well placed to offer assistance and should be supported,&quot; Moore said in a letter to the Lancet. It is co-signed by Catherine Houlihan, a senior research fellow and Dr Ron Behrens, a clinician at the college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they had anecdotal evidence of NHS doctors, nurses and other health professionals who had been refused unpaid leave or permission to go to west Africa in holiday time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really have to think much bigger than the day to day. The best way to control our health is control the health of those around us. Studies have proven that. In the US, cost-benefit analyses showed that the best way to control TB was to assist the South American countries in controlling TB,&quot; said Behrens. &quot;It is much more cost effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a global community and as a society we depend on others. We have to take global support more seriously,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their intervention comes two days after the first British patient, Will Pooley, was declared completely clear of the disease after being treated at the Royal Free hospital in north London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the King's Fund, which had volunteers in Sierra Leone, were all &quot;desperate&quot; to get skilled staff there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NHS staff are trained in both risk assessment and use of personal protective equipment but they also have specialisms critical to the fight against the spread of Ebola including expertise in virology, microbiology and infection control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their experience and new skills would enhance the NHS pool of expertise for similar events in the future,&quot; they said in their letter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola epidemic can be stopped in its tracks, but it will take at least six to nine months and cost more than $600m (&pound;365m), according to the director general of the World Health Organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Washington, senior WHO leaders including director general Dr Margaret Chan, called for a massive global response to the outbreak and suggested it would take longer to control than has yet been assumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak is &quot;the largest, most complex and most severe we've ever seen&quot;, said Chan and spreading at a pace that outstrips effort to control it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone have between them reported about 3,500 cases and 1,900 deaths. The latest spread is to Port Harcourt in Nigeria, where it is likely that the virus will have been transmitted to many people from an infected doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, which says its volunteer doctors on the frontline are overwhelmed, has called on UN member states to send in teams of military and civilian biohazard experts. WHO's assistant director general for global health security, Keiji Fukuda, just back from west Africa, acknowledged that there are not enough people with the necessary skills and training to deal with all the cases in the affected region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We don't have enough health workers, doctors, nurses, drivers and contact tracers. Most of the infections are happening in the community, and many people are unwilling to identify themselves as ill. And if they do, we don't have enough ambulances to transport them or beds to treat them yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families are forced to care for patients at home, putting them and their contacts at risk of infection because of the shortage of health workers and facilities, he said. Mobilising international financial support and additional health personnel is a top priority for scaling up the international response, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airline routes to affected countries also urgently need to be re-opened. Closures &quot;have a huge impact,&quot; Fukuda said, impeding the flow of experts and supplies into Africa, and the outbreak itself is having a negative impact on the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. &quot;People need medical supplies, food, fuel, charcoal, and other provisions. We have to get it to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fukuda pointed out that WHO had not recommended any travel restrictions, &quot;except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with Ebola virus disease or where individuals have had contact with cases of Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr David Nabarro, UN coordinator for the Ebola response, said the UN system is working together on 12 detailed steps for the global response, which he estimated will cost at least $600m and require &quot;several thousand people to scale up our response by three to four times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urgent needs in the affected countries include communications and messaging, care for the infected and proper burials, diagnosis and contact tracing, health services for other conditions, transport and supplies, cash to pay health workers, medical services for responders, air and sea access, and strong coordination to avert economic downturns, says WHO.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the scare of Ebola and the subsequent quarantining of the community, the police Community outreach team on Tuesday, September 2 visited Dolo Town near Harbel to provide reassurance to the people that all efforts will be made by the government to cater to their needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the second in a series of outreach programs being executed by police authorities after a successful launch in West Point two weeks ago to spread the message of hope and to provide tips to residents on how to prevent contracting the deadly Ebola Virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police convoy was greeted by jubilant residents who lined the routes to the Market center to welcome the Inspector General and delegation as well as listen to the message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a brief ceremony, Police Inspector-General, C. Clarence Massaquoi who led an array of senior officers, and accompanied by the Head of the United Nations Mission Police in Liberia (UNPOL) Commissioner Gregory Hinds said government was concerned about their plight and would do anything to provide the much needed humanitarian assistance while they are being quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector General Massaquoi said the Police was delighted to visit the area as part of its community outreach programme to engage in public awareness on the prevention and spread of the deadly Ebola Virus that has caused the community to be quarantined by the Liberian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our presence is to show that we love you and will not abandon you&quot;, Police Inspector General Massaquoi told the enthusiastic crowd as he distributed Ebola and Crime Prevention materials to the community of Dolo Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Boss used the occasion to remind that they have a responsibility to ensure that the community is free of the deadly virus by listening to advice of Health Workers and engaging in activities that would curtail the further spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government and its International Partners are doing all in their power to fight this deadly Ebola Virus, but it is also incumbent upon you the residents of Dolo Town to also make sure that you cooperate in the fight&quot;. We all have to fight to kick Ebola out of Liberia&quot; drawing the crowd to chant in support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the police will remain engaged with the various communities in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police presented thermometers, safety gloves, and dozens of T-shirts with inscriptions of Ebola messages, symptoms and preventative measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Special remark, the UNPOL Commissioner of Police spoke the UMNIL commitment to assist the Liberian Government in the fight against Ebola. He said the UN Police was working collaboratively with their Liberian National Police in ensuring that the mandate of the police was implemented without hindrance. UNPOL recently donated six Nissan 4&times;4 Jeeps to the LNP for deployment in communities severely affected by the Ebola scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Margibi County Statutory District # 2 Superintendent Henric Marcus Speare welcomed The Police Hierarchy to the township and expressed gratitude that the Inspector General Massaquoi and his team of Senior Officers had come to the town to identify with the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in a show of support for the Inspector Massaquoi and the police efforts, a local charity, Crowd '50 donated an assortment of food items valued at over two thousand United States Dollars to the Dolo's Town residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The items included 50 bags of 25kg of rice, 20 three-gallon of vegetable oil, four bags of 50kg of sugar, two bags of flour and 150 sacks of mineral water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of Crowd '50, Samuel Wonwi Thompson said his organization support to the residents was a way of identifying with their plight and to boost police efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in addition to their official mandate of protecting life and property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowd '50 was founded in the 1980's by Liberian men born in the 1950's from various professional backgrounds to cater the needs to Liberians nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, various speakers representing the religious, youth and other groups hailed the police for the gesture and their continuing protection. They described the police as a friend of the community who was also ready and willing to render assistance to them when called upon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montserrado County Representative Edwin M. Snowe has frowned on individuals calling for the configuration of an interim regime, using the country's current Ebola crisis as justification. He made the statement Tuesday when he served as guest panelist on the ELBC 99.9 Super Morning Show.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Snowe said the Ebola outbreak should not be used a political tool, and regretted that some people are using the recent decision to quarantine West Point and Dolo Town as if the government is punishing its own citizens. Rep. Snowe noted: &quot;We can help our people without using the (Ebola) situation for political gains or without attaching a price tag to our assistance to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe, who is Montserrado District #6 Representative, pointed out: &quot;Some people claiming to be Liberians are sitting out of the country, not knowing the ongoing situation and are calling for a change of government; they don't love this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that the current fight against the deadly Ebola disease has plunged the country's economy into a state of regression that needs to be speedily recovered in order to guarantee the attainment of the country's development agenda. The lawmaker challenged Liberians to assist the government in recovering the country's economy as engaging in negative political undertakings will only hamper government's effort to strengthen the growth of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Snowe has said the statement that Liberia's situation will get worse before it gets better as observed by a visiting American official should not be taken lightly, noting that every Liberian must now begin to redirect their efforts in assisting the government in the fight against the Ebola virus. &quot;Liberians are a resilient people who are strong and we can fight this disease and eradicate it from this country together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WESTERN countries should send military medical teams to Africa to avoid &quot;losing the battle&quot; against the Ebola outbreak, the head of a leading aid agency said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola has swept through four countries in West Africa, claiming at least 1,552 lives in the worst epidemic on record. Local health systems are overwhelmed, particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and doctors and nurses have often been infected. There is a desperate shortage of intensive care beds for people with the virus - and of testing facilities for those showing symptoms. As a result, people who could be infected often feel they have little reason to come forward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Joanne Liu, the international president of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res, told the United Nations that every government was &quot;failing to come to grips with this transnational threat&quot; and the &quot;world is losing the battle to contain it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis had reached such proportions that &quot;riots&quot; were breaking out in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, while in Sierra Leone &quot;infectious bodies are rotting in the streets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;treatment centres&quot; established for people with Ebola had become &quot;places where people go to die alone, where little more than palliative care is offered&quot;, added Dr Liu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, the number of recorded Ebola cases stands at 3,069 in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the World Health Organisation predicts that another 20,000 people will be infected in the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Liu urged Western countries to escalate their response and dispatch military medical teams. &quot;We have been losing for the past six months: we must win over the next three,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To curb the epidemic, it is imperative that states immediately deploy civilian and military assets with expertise in biohazard containment. I call upon you to dispatch your disaster response teams, backed by the full weight of your logistical capabilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Britain's case, this might involve deploying an Army field hospital - or providing airlift or logistical support for others to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During previous Ebola outbreaks, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res has used specialist treatment centres with 30 beds. The aid agency's facility in Monrovia currently has 200 beds - and it needs about 1,000 to cope with the number of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Liu called for a &quot;regional network of field hospitals&quot; to be established in West Africa, supported by &quot;dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She added: &quot;Without this deployment, we will never get the epidemic under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The panic caused by the spread of Ebola was illustrated by a scene in Monrovia yesterday. Video footage, which has not been independently verified, apparently shows an Ebola patient walking through a market in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man had supposedly escaped from a treatment centre. The video shows him being caught by four medical personnel wearing yellow protective suits. He struggles and tries to escape, before being bundled into a waiting vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military teams should be sent to west Africa immediately if there is to be any hope of controlling the Ebola epidemic, doctors on the frontline told the United Nations yesterday, painting a stark picture of health workers dying, patients left without care and infectious bodies lying in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international president of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), Dr Joanne Liu, told member states that although alarm bells had been ringing for six months, the response had been too little, too late and no amount of vaccinations and new drugs would be able to prevent the escalating disaster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In west Africa, cases and deaths continue to surge,&quot; she said. &quot;Riots are breaking out. Isolation centres are overwhelmed. Health workers on the frontline are becoming infected and are dying in shocking numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Others have fled in fear, leaving people without care for even the most common illnesses. Entire health systems have crumbled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Ebola treatment centres had been reduced to places where people went to die alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is impossible to keep up with the sheer number of infected people pouring into facilities. In Sierra Leone, infectious bodies are rotting in the streets,&quot; she said. &quot;Rather than building new Ebola care centres in Liberia, we are forced to build crematoria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation estimated last week that 20,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been infected over three months. Medecins sans Frontieres has doubled its staff of volunteer doctors in the region but is unable to cope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic can be stopped, said Liu, but only if governments send in biohazard teams and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the member states represented here today have invested heavily in biological threat response,&quot; she said at the UN. &quot;You have a political and humanitarian responsibility to immediately utilise these capabilities in Ebola-affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To curb the epidemic, it is imperative that states immediately deploy civilian and military assets with expertise in biohazard containment. I call upon you to dispatch your disaster response teams, backed by the full weight of your logistical capabilities. This should be done in close collaboration with the affected countries. Without this deployment, we will never get the epidemic under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money is no longer the main issue, according to MSF, and voluntary help is not enough. Skilled and well equipped teams are needed on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments should send in military and civilian experts who can increase the number of isolation centres and deploy mobile laboratories that can be used to diagnose more cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military-style operations are required to establish dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment around west Africa and a regional network of field hospitals must be built to treat medical staff who are infected or suspected of being infected. About a tenth of the deaths have been among health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must also address the collapse of state infrastructure,&quot; Liu said. &quot;The health system in Liberia has collapsed. Pregnant women experiencing complications have nowhere to turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Malaria and diarrhoea, easily preventable and treatable diseases, are killing people. Hospitals need to be reopened and newly created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lastly, she said, there must be a change of approach by affected countries. &quot;Coercive measures, such as laws criminalising the failure to report suspected cases, and forced quarantines, are driving people underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is leading to the concealment of cases, and is pushing the sick away from health systems. These measures have only served to breed fear and unrest, rather than contain the virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liu was speaking as nurses in Liberia went on strike for better pay and equipment to protect themselves from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Tugbeh, spokesman for the strikers at John F Kennedy hospital in Monrovia, said the nurses would not return to work until they are supplied with &quot;personal protective equipment (PPEs)&quot;, the clothing that guards against infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the beginning of the Ebola outbreak we have not had any protective equipment to work with. As a result, so many doctors got infected by the virus. We have to stay home until we get the PPEs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surgical section at John F Kennedy hospital is the only trauma referral centre in Liberia. The hospital closed temporarily in July owing to the infections and deaths of an unspecified number of health workers who had been treating Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need proper equipment to work with (and) we need better pay because we are going to risk our lives,&quot; Tugbeh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has also warned of serious food shortages as a result of restrictions on movement in the Ebola-hit countries. &quot;Access to food has become a pressing concern for many people in the three affected countries and their neighbours,&quot; said Bukar Tijani, the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation regional representative for Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley, the first British person to contract the deadly Ebola virus, has been discharged from hospital in London, a spokesman said on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old volunteer nurse has been receiving treatment at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, London, since being flown back to Britain from Sierra Leone on an RAF plane 10 days ago. Pooley contracted the virus after five weeks volunteering at a clinic in Kenema, where he was helping to treat patients with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was being treated at the Royal Free's isolation unit, where he received the experimental drug ZMapp, which has proved effective in tests on monkeys but has not been subjected to trials on humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, Robin, said on Monday that Pooley was doing &quot;pretty well&quot;. After his admission, Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infectious diseases at the Royal Free, described Pooley as a &quot;resilient and remarkable young man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference on 26 August, Jacobs said it would take a week for there to be more clarity around Pooley's prognosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus, which is spreading across west Africa, has claimed more than 1,500 lives and infected more than 3,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation, which has said as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is contained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second American doctor to be infected with Ebola while serving a humanitarian mission in Liberia has been identified as Rick Sacra, a 51-year-old family physician from Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacra, who was working for the for the international missionary group SIM USA, returned to Liberia about a month ago after learning that two other American missionaries had contracted the deadly disease, the group's president Bruce Johnson said at a press conference in North Carolina on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said it is not yet clear how Sacra contracted the disease as he was not working in the hospital's Ebola isolation unit. Sacra is being treated by doctors at the hospital where, until just days ago, he was helping deliver babies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacra immediately quarantined himself in the hospital's isolation ward after showing symptoms of Ebola, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if Sacra was going to be flown back to the US for treatment, as two other Americans were, Johnson said all options are under consideration but the focus is on his care in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Bruce Ribner, the head of Emory University hospital's infectious disease unit in Atlanta where the two other infected missionaries were treated, told NBC's Today show that he does not know if Sacra will be flown to the US for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know there have been discussions that this person will be coming back to the United States,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly are the first Americans to survive the deadly virus that has claimed more than 1,500 lives, according to the World Health Organization. There have been roughly 3,050 confirmed or suspected cases. A fourth American with dual Liberian citizenship, Patrick Sawyer, died last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same press conference on Wednesday, Writebol, speaking publicly for the first time, recounted the night she found out she had contracted the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from the SIM USA headquarters in North Carolina, Writebol said her husband, David, walked into her bedroom where she was resting as she believed she had malaria. Her husband first told her the news that Brantly had been diagnosed with Ebola, and she said her heart sank. Then he told her that she too had tested positive for the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaking as she spoke, Writebol said: &quot;I had no clue what was going to happen. Of course I knew what the outcome could be, and yet there was no fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writebol said the next few days were a blur, as she was transported to the US where she joined Brantly in a two-room isolation unit at Emory University hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were many mornings I woke up and thought 'I'm alive', and there were many mornings I woke up and thought, 'I don't think I'm going to make it anymore,'&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly and Writebol received doses of an experimental drug treatment that has yet to go through full clinical and human trials. Doctors do not know whether the drug was effective or not, but both patients credit the serum in helping them recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writebol said she believes that her unwavering faith, support from her family and friends, the specially trained staff at Emerson and the experimental serum all played a role in her recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Brantly and his wife, Amber, sat down with NBC News' Matt Lauer to speak for the first time about his experience fighting the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly family has been living in seclusion in Asheville, North Carolina, since Kent's release from the hospital. Brantly said he is still weak but improving each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly said he woke up on 23 July feeling a &quot;little off&quot;. He said he felt warm and had a low fever. Brantly said he was first tested for malaria, but to his dismay, the results came back negative. At that point, he said his family and friends starting praying for it to be dengue fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly said he was thankful Amber and his two children had already left the country by the time he fell ill. His wife and children had returned to Texas for a wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber said she couldn't even relate the emotions she felt when her husband called her with the news that he had contracted Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew what was coming,&quot; Amber said, brushing away tears. &quot;I'd seen him treat these people who had already been diagnosed and I knew how it ends. I knew how everyone had ended up so far. So I had the disadvantage of having the knowledge of the course of the disease. I was scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just weeks ago, doctors declared Brantly and Writebol virus-free and discharged them from the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly said he wanted to share his story to draw attention to the ongoing crisis in west Africa. On Tuesday, the director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tom Frieden, said the disease was &quot;spiraling out of control&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fight against the deadly Ebola virus intensifies, the United States Government has committed US$1.7 million to be used to provide direct food assistance to Ebola patients in Liberia, in partnership with the World Food Program (WFP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a luncheon with the media held at the Embassy Suite in Mamba Point, United States Ambassador, Deborah R. Malac, said the United States will like to see the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) not playing the role of law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stressed that the U.S. is hoping to see the Liberia National Police (LNP) taking the lead in security. She said with the Liberia National Police taking the lead, Liberians will feel more secured and move forward to do all they can to eradicate the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac mentioned that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is not in Liberia to do an assessment on the health system in Liberia. She said the CDC is here to determine the gap in the health system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stressed that the Liberian Government should be in the lead to tell its partners where the gaps are, to enable the Liberian health sector and its partners eradicate the Ebola virus. She said in the past weeks the U.S. Government through the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), airlifted more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, she said DART is working to expand the pipeline of medical equipment and supplies flowing into Monrovia in the coming weeks to ensure that healthcare workers have the resources they need to safely do their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said DART and CDC are training local health workers on proper use of medical equipment including personal protective equipment, ways to prevent the spread of the disease and how to detect if someone has the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama yesterday sent a message to the people of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. He said his government is working along with the four African countries that are affected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama stated that stopping the Ebola virus won't be easy, but together lives can be saved. He said the United States will work with these countries to improve public health, so that this kind of outbreak doesn't happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sated further, &quot;In this urgent work and in building a stronger and more prosperous Africa, you will continue to have a partner in me and the United States of America&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, the lady (name withheld) has been showing Ebola symptoms for nearly a week until she left the Police Barracks last week to see her mother apparently for care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is said to have died at the home of her mother about two days ago. When the contact tracing team got the news that the woman was living at the Police Barracks with her lover, they reached a decision to quarantine block &quot;C&quot; building of the police barracks where she was residing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Block &quot;C&quot; building is currently quarantined as officers residing therein remain trapped inside until a period of 21 days. The barracks contain three buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer whose wife died from Ebola was recently on assignment at the Headquarters of the LNP. It is not known whether the entire headquarters will be quarantined as civilian staffers and police officers who interacted with the PSU officer whose wife died, are said to be worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter who visited the Barracks Monday saw police officers preventing their colleagues and families from leaving the building as water barrels were taken in the compound for the quarantined officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States Ambassador to Liberia has for the first time spoken on the recent West Point shooting by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soldiers were deployed in the Township of West Point in keeping with quarantine order released by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf but Ambassador Deborah Malac frowns that the Armed Forces of Liberia should not play law enforcement role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four persons were reportedly wounded in the densely populated community after AFL soldiers opened gun fire protesters to disperse the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the wounded persons, 15-year-old Shaki Kamara has since been buried following his death as a result of bullet wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Minister Brownie Samukai, who earlier denied that there was no shooting in the area, later admitted that indeed there was guns fire in the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a media interaction Tuesday in Monrovia, Ambassador Malac said the incident was unfortunate urging the Liberian government not to use the Armed Forces of Liberia to enforce the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac said the Liberia National Police and the Bureau of Immigration and Nationalization should be given the chance to take over security in the Ebola outbreak in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Envoy said her government is happy that an investigative committee has been setup to probe the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the United States government believes that the Armed Forces of Liberia should not play a law enforcement role, because it has an appropriate role to play in the Ebola response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac told the media gathering that the US Government is looking forward to the outcome of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently Defense authorities instructed AFL soldiers to use 'deadly force' against violators while the Deputy Chief of Staff of the army gave similar mandate, ordering his men to shoot the legs of violators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Pointers mentioned that the medical certificate is intended to clear them of stigmatization that West Point is harboring Ebola victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of West Point residents told the NEWS in an interview following the removal of the blockage from their area, that the quarantine was only intended to increase hardship on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Pointers disclosed that at no time did government carry out medical examination during the ten days of quarantine or any international organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them, the government has placed them in an embarrassing situation where they will have to keep clarifying to others that they are not Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents believe that they would be set free from the huge public stigmatization when government provides medical certificate indicating that there are no Ebola patients in West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Deputy Information Minister Isaac Jackson has attributed the lifting of the quarantine ban on the people of West Point after ten days to recommendations from health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Jackson who failed to state whether government's action was based on local or international health authorities' recommendations said West Point is well organized in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Jackson pointed out that West Point is now divided into seven zones and the Ebola awareness is high in the Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that government is also considering the removal of the quarantine imposed on the people of Dolo Town in Margibi County.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ELWA Treatment Center, according health sources was temporarily closed to new patients for ongoing expansion of the facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source told a team of LMC/IREX sponsored journalists Tuesday that securities and health workers have been ordered to reject all new patients coming to the facilities until otherwise notified.</SPAN></P>

Sirleaf to Europe and the United States of America to provide first hand presentations to international partners on the present state of the Ebola Epidemic plaguing our country, Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sirleaf will use his presentations and interactions with his international colleagues and partners to seek additional assistance for Liberia in furtherance to the national efforts to tackle the spread of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in Monrovia, the Robert Sirleaf Foundation quotes Mr. Sirleaf as saying that it was a tough decision to leave the country during this critical national period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an unfortunate National crisis on our hands, and I know we need all hands on deck to tackle this Ebola crisis, however, this trip compels me to meet with our partners to brief them on what we are doing and how they can assist our country and people. Our people are dying daily and I'm not happy as much as all Liberians. I don't feel good. We do not want a country wherein Ebola is killing our people so we have to do something and do it now,&quot; Mr. Sirleaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his departure from the country, Mr. Sirleaf led several efforts by his foundation in raising awareness on how to prevent contracting and spreading the disease and providing support to underprivileged communities throughout Montserrado County, one of the epic centers of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sirleaf who returns shortly to the country has meanwhile, praised the efforts of Health workers in the forefront of fighting the disease, International Responders - the Center for Disease Control-USA, the World Health Organization and Medicine San Frontier (MSF) as well as other well-meaning Liberians for their volunteer expertise and support in helping to kick the deadly disease from Liberia and the sub-sub region.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyndy Kobbah came out of the C.H. Rennie Hospital in Margibi County filled with praises and appreciation for GOD first and those who kept her in prayers. She appeared feisty days after her release from the ELWA isolation center pronounced Ebola free. Kyndy was among three doctors who were given the experimental Ebola drug ZMapp recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Kyndy, it was an emotional moment and a home coming after she and professional colleagues survived the scourge of the deadly virus. Her colleagues, family members and loved ones were filled with ecstasy to see Kyndy looking buoyant as she resumed work to save humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a commitment and devotion to duty in a country where health workers have sacrificed their lives to save others [and have received zilch in return] is the biggest disservice any government can pay back a professional bloc. It is worth mentioning that of the estimated 700 persons who have lost their lives to Ebola in Liberia, more than one third are doctors and professional nurses. Even now, they continue to be threatened by the disease which has shown no sign of floundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this situation at hand, there are indications that huge problems still persist in getting the much needy support to health workers who are in the front line against the Ebola disease. Health practitioners are complaining that support needed to invigorate them to obliterate the disease is not forthcoming. Health workers are complaining that the lack of support hampers their ability to save lives. These distractions undercut the efforts of local and international supports to Liberia and would suggest that the government is either not serious about fighting Ebola or simply lack the ability or capacity to deal with the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may not be the case, but health workers continue to complain about the difficulties they are experiencing in the front line against Ebola. There must be reciprocity for the risk health practitioners are taking to save lives; they deserve better than creating a situation that would force them to recoil. President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, head of the government's task force on Ebola, must ensure that support needed for health workers across the country are made available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaints about lack of support to health workers and institutions are the same everywhere. At the ELWA hospital, Dr. Jerry Brown and his team of dedicated servants have been outstanding in helping to revive the lives of over 30 suspected Ebola patients. Yet, the quality of their work has been undermined by unserious bureaucrats who take health practitioners for granted, especially at the time Ebola has become the most threatening disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) says Ebola has taken the lives of over 1,550 people from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. The UN agency warned that an estimated 20,000 people risk infection. This figure, according to the WHO, could increase unless measures are put in place [in Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone] to contain it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, I find it difficult to understand why health workers would complain about lapses in the health sector when the government continues to receive inexorable amount of financial and material support from within Liberia and abroad in the fight against Ebola. Perhaps, no government in the history of Liberia has enjoyed such an overwhelming support against a virus than this administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians are appalled that in the face of the huge support against the Ebola virus, the government task force has not shown that it is capable of handling the epidemic. The situation is getting worse, and people are getting infected everyday. Therefore, health workers must be prioritized because they are on the front line; if they get infected, Liberians risk getting infected as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing Ebola fight in the sub region especially in Liberia has being described as a major challenge that is beyond the capacity of the Liberian government in its attempts to contain the spread of the virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to journalists during the roundtable conference yesterday, US Ambassador Marlac said the ebola fight has grown to a situation that the government of Liberia needs to identify those areas that the US government and international partners can make the necessary contributions in containing the virus from further spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a round table discussion with journalists in Monrovia yesterday, the Ambassador United States of America, Deborah Marlac, said since the outbreak of the virus from Foyah in Lofa County to other parts of the country, Liberia's government has made several efforts but continue to face challenges that requires the involvement of everyone including the government of the United of States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In whatever the government and people of Liberia may employ, the US Diplomat to Liberia indicated they have to lead the way in finding a lasting solution to the present health crisis which has shown the fragility of the Liberian healthcare sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of the Ebola outbreak, she stressed, is a clear indications to every Liberian and the international community that the government could not make any impact if the Liberian citizens and the international body do not see the outbreak as a global treat that needs to be treated as such in the response processes to have the disease wheel out of the country and the sub region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Marlac noted that there is no time for people to shift blame or claim self-glory in the fight against the virus; rather, she said it becomes the responsibility of every Liberian, the partners of Liberia and members of the international community to have the virus brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing the the commitment of US government and people to fighting the virus to the end, Amb. Marlac noted that the US government do not support or will encourage the closure of borders, airports and the suspension of flights to or from Liberia due to the outbreak of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the decision to isolate Liberia and ebola affected countries by other nations in Africa and other parts of the world as a means of fighting the disease was not the right approach in the fight against the Ebola virus in Liberia and the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, the US Ambassador disclosed that US President, Barrack Obama on behalf of the government and people of the United States of America has released an audio tape with a strong Ebola message intended to increasing public awareness by the US government and people through President Barrack Obama to the people of Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria in their respective approaches to controlling the virus spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US, she indicated, recognized the need to have testing centers for Ebola done in Liberia rather than sending samplings or specimen to Guinea or Sierra Leone for results. For this reason, experts from the U.S Defense Department of Threat Reduction Agency, the National Institutes for Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention upgraded the testing laboratory at the Liberia Institute for Biological Research for Ebola test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States have been a key partner in the fight against Ebola from the country, committing more than $21 million to combat Ebola virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa since the outbreak in March 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides,$1.7 million through World Food Program WFP was committed to be used to provide direct food assistance to Ebola patients in Liberia in addition to a 26-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) dispatched to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to oversee the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government's engagement in the fight against Ebola in the subregion while, the Atlantic-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more 70 disease -control experts in West Africa, providing technical expertise to national public health agencies to help prevent, detect and stop the spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Embassy also disclosed that in the past weeks of August, the US government through DART was able to airlift to Liberia more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to including 500 infrared thermometers to bolsters Ebola screening efforts, 5,000 body bags, 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE), 2 water treatment units, 2 portable water tanks, capable of storing 10,000 liters each, 100 rolls of plastic sheeting for sue in construction of Ebola treatment units among several thousand gallons of chloride among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Embassy has released the audio and transcript of the President Obama's counsel to the people of West Africa on the Ebola crisis. Below is a full transcript as circulated by the United States Embassy during the round table with journalist:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hello. This is President Barrack Obama. I want to take a few moments to speak directly to you-the people of West Africa, especially Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. On behalf of the American people, I want you to know that our prayers are with those of you who have lost loved ones during this terrible outbreak of Ebola. Along with our partners around the world, the United States is working with your governments to help stop this disease, and the first step in this known facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu. You cannot get it from causal contact, like sitting next to someone on a bus. You cannot get it from another person until they show the symptoms of the disease, like fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Second, the most common way you can get Ebola is by touching the body fluids of some who's is sick or has died from the it--like their sweat, saliva or blood--or through a contaminated item, like a needle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the disease is continuing to spread where patients are being cared for at home or during burials when families and friends lay their loved one to rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why health care workers wear protection like gloves and mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is why, if you feel sick with a high fever, you should get help right away-because with prompt treatment in a medical center, nearly half of patients can recover. And it's why, when burying someone who died from this disease, it's important to not directly touch their body; you can respect your traditions and honor your loved ones without risking the lives of the living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stopping this disease won't be easy-but we know how to do it. You are not alone. Together, we can treat those who are sick with respect and dignity. We can save lives. And our countries can work together to improve public health, so this kind of outbreak doesn't happen again. In this urgent work-and in building a stronger and more prosperous Africa-you'll continue to have a partner in me and in the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montserrado County Representative Edwin M. Snowe has frowned on individuals calling for the configuration of an interim regime, using the country's current Ebola crisis as justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the statement Tuesday when he served as guest panelist on the ELBC 99.9 Super Morning Show.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Snowe said the Ebola outbreak should not be used a political tool, and regretted that some people are using the recent decision to quarantine West Point and Dolo Town as if the government is punishing its own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe noted: &quot;We can help our people without using the (Ebola) situation for political gains or without attaching a price tag to our assistance to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe, who is Montserrado District #6 Representative, pointed out: &quot;Some people claiming to be Liberians are sitting out of the country not knowing the ongoing situation and are calling for a change of government; they don't love this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that the current fight against the deadly Ebola disease has plunged the country's economy into a state of regression that needs to be speedily recovered in order to guarantee the attainment of the country's development agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker challenged Liberians to assist the government in recovering the country's economy as engaging in negative political undertakings will only hamper government's effort to strengthen the growth of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Snowe has said the statement that Liberia's situation will get worse before it gets better as observed by a visiting American official should not be taken lightly, noting that every Liberian must now begin to redirect their effort in assisting government in the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberians are a resilient people who are strong and we can fight this disease and eradicate it from this country together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Switzerland has donated to the Government of Liberia 15 tons of medical supplies to be used by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for the fight against the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The medical supplies which include sanitizers, masks and gloves are valued at One Hundred and Sixty Thousand United States Dollars (US$160,000.00).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consignment arrived in the country on Tuesday, September 2, 2014, on a chartered flight sent by the Swiss Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a brief handover ceremony at the Roberts International Airport, Mr. Friedrich Steinemann, Director of Cooperation and Counselor Affairs at the Swiss Embassy Office in Liberia said the Swiss Government is glad to assist Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steinemann stated that with the constant use of hand sanitizers and personal hygiene, there is hope that Ebola will be kicked out of Liberia. The Counselor furthered that the Swiss Government looks forward to assist if there is more need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Rufus Neufville, Chief of Protocol of Liberia, expressed thanks and appreciation on behalf of the Liberian Leader, Her Excellency, Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Government and People of Liberia to the Government and People of Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neufville stressed that Liberia is facing difficulties with what he called a strange virus. The Chief of Protocol elaborated that the Swiss donation will go down in history, as this donation portrays the fraternity between both Switzerland and Liberia and true partnership to Liberia in this difficult situation. &quot;It is our hope that many of Liberia's friends in the international community follow&quot;, remarked Hon. Neufville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mathew T.K. Flomo, Deputy Health Minister for Administration, articulated that once again the Government and People of Liberia through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare are gratified by the Swiss Government's donation. He recalled that the Swiss Government had previously donated to the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Flomo then recalled that the Swiss Government renovated and capacitated the Tellewoyan Hospital in Voinjama, Lofa County. &quot;We hope for more donations from the Swiss Government, especially PPE's and body bags&quot;, concluded Minister Flomo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representing the National Ebola Taskforce, Mr. Saah Charles N'tow, expressed happiness and extended thanks through the Swiss Embassy Office to the Government and People of Switzerland. Mr. N'tow said that the donation from the Swiss Government represents hope for Liberians who see this Ebola crisis as a hopeless situation. Mr. N'tow added that the donated items are what medical personnel currently need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical supplies brings to an estimated amount of One Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$1.6 million) the Swiss Government's donation thus far towards the fight against Ebola since the discovery of the deadly virus in Liberia in March of this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While disclosing the sailing of more than 13 vessels expected to dock at the Free Port of Monrovia in the next few days, the Management of the National Port Authority NPA has declared zero tolerance against Ebola amongst port workers and users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the Deputy Managing Director of the National Port Authority, NyekehForkpa, said the National Port Authority has put some measures in place for port employees and port users to combat the deadly Ebola Virus within the premises of the institution and also established an emergency response team (ERT).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPA's deputy MD who heads the ERT naming other members of the team as Jeffrey George, Marcus Cooper, JinkensSaye, George Sumo, Karl Gnomionsin, Lester Cheepoo and debra Woods, added, &quot;no shore leave passes will be issued vessel crew members during this time [of emergency].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday at a News Conference held at the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism on Capitol Hill, Mr. Forkpa said port users entering the port's premises must wash their hands and wipe the bottom of their shoes with chlorine and soap upon entering and at various checkpoints throughout the ports in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forkpa said everyone, including employees, contractors and casual workers, entering the premises of the will be subjected to body temperature monitoring and digital temperature testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a port user shows a temperature of at least 100 degree Fahrenheit or 37.8 degree centigrade from screening at the gates ... will be considered an early Ebola Symptoms and will not be allowed into the port without MOH clearance,&quot; Mr. Forkpah warned, saying that the ERT must be notified immediately during the access denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accentuated that all staff boarding NPA buses must wear long pants, long sleeve-shirts and blouses, saying that they will be subject to spraying prior to the start of work and re-sprayed before departure for any other assignment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke of buses of the NPA which he said will be boarded only by staff members sprayed before departure from the compound of the NPA at the end of the work day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forkpah further noted that transport officers and drivers reserve the NOT to allow any employee who appears to show symptoms of the ebola virus on the buses as emergency response team (ERT) set up by the NPA will be informed immediately of an incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, all SOS calls will be responded to as usual and entry visas will be respected and continuous inspections will be conducted by the Ebola Respond Team (ERT) throughout the ports to confirm there are no potential EBOLA Cases indicating, &quot; ... the ERT will conduct coordinated mock exercises at random intervals to test the responsiveness of Ebola Emergency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it is determined by the ERT Health Care Practitioner that the symptoms are Ebola related such as nausea, headache, and tiredness, Mr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forkpa told journalists that the person will be required to move to the designated care center and the ministry of health will be immediately informed to take control of the cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated that all stevedores or local employees boarding any vessel must be thoroughly screened for Ebola, stressing that if the screening shows the symptoms of Ebola, the suspect must be isolated and the Emergency Response Team be notified immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPA's DMDA,who said these are some of the safety measures put in place so far by the NPA, added that the stance by the institutions has attracted more ships to sail to Liberia which also shows that the NPA is Ebola free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, he informed the journalists that experts from the Center for Diseas Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization andother international partners, upon touring the entity and seeing measures put in place by the entity, graded as one up to the standard set by Government's National Ebola Taskforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, Mr. Forkpa stated that since June up to the end of August, the NPA has received about over 30-35 tankers and vessels monthly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to questions, NPA's deputy managing director for administration said management and staff members have made significant strides in the fight against the virus while sustaining contacts with vessel owners and companies for vessels to still sail and dock at Liberian ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Forpka said the NPA was gaining more attraction by the international shipping industries and business entities thus encouraging businesses, especially shipping lines, to keep that trust of doing business with the NPA, the government and people of Liberia in the midst of the prevailing health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed confidence that the Liberian government and people will soon defeat the Ebola virus to once more have the usual opportunities that has been denied as result of the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with The ANALYST yesterday, the Secretary General of NTAL, Mr. Samuel Y. Johnson said is a threat to the human resource sector in the country which in itself seizes all normal activities and imposes suffering upon the country now and in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson said the closure of schools has an adverse economic effect on society and sent backward the educational system of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the NTAL's secretary general, the closure of schools is not the only measure that could stop the spread of the virus; instead, he said there are many other options, regulations and policies the government could put into place to stop the spread of the disease among students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the measures could be training of teachers on ebola prevention, reducing the number of students in class and attaching a very strong penalty to violator(s).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling on all teachers across the country to help spread the message on how to prevent the virus from dispersal, Mr. Johnson also called on the government to listen to the NTAL's appeal and reconsider its decision by allowing the reopening of schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the second global menace facing mankind next to terrorism is Ebola. The deadly virus has rift through four or five West African countries and is crisscrossing continents according to some reports, making itself transnational epidemic. The World Health Organization states that as of 27 August 2014, the cumulative number of Ebola cases in the affected countries stands at more than 3000, with over 1400 deaths, making this the largest Ebola outbreak ever recorded, with the heartbreaking estimate of up to 20,000 more to possibly be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things look grim and hopeless in Liberia, Sierra and Guinea particularly amid huge gaps in the health systems of the affected countries. Other nations are on edge. Nevertheless, comforting words are being poured from abroad that the beleaguered countries are not fighting alone and that far-reaching consolidation and collaborative efforts are underway to bring the Ebola nightmare to an end. The President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, is ahead of the list of comforters, as The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Ebola menace were a visible enemy as Liberians had seen in nearly 16 years of armed conflict, a lot of citizens and foreigners residing here would be seeking asylum, even if it meant trooping back into the woods. Teens of people are plastic-bagged each day and dumped into mass graves, many reportedly shamefully cremated against the culture of Liberia. Chilling moment for Liberia and its neighbors The phrase, gloom and doom, has come out fully literarily and practically and despairs smell in the air forcefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is not turning its back. Even the United States, Liberia's quasi colonizer, which in the days of the brutal civil conflict sat on the fence, refusing to put booths of the ground here, are forcing rallying against the pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the national nervousness--the fear that Ebola waits right at the doorsteps of homes--reassuring words are coming from the world's powerful nation, the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stopping this disease won't be easy--but we know how to do it,&quot; US President Barack Obama said in a televised statement yesterday. And he said reassuringly, &quot;You are not alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, he said &quot;we can treat those who are sick with respect and dignity. We can save lives. And our countries can work together to improve public health, so this kind of outbreak doesn't happen again. In this urgent work--and in building a stronger and more prosperous Africa--you'll continue to have a partner in me and in the United States of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to calm the wild fears and unfounded postulations that the deadly Ebola is airborne and randomly infects--mystical attributions soaring more apprehensions and must have provided different kinds of illnesses, such an high blood pressure--President Obama said: &quot;First, Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu. You cannot get it from casual contact, like sitting next to someone on a bus. You cannot get it from another person until they show the symptoms of the disease, like fever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US President further state other facts about the disease, saying that &quot;the most common way you can get Ebola is by touching the body fluids of someone who's sick or has died from it--like their sweat, saliva or blood--or through a contaminated item, like a needle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why the disease is continuing to spread where patients are being cared for at home or during burials when families and friends lay their loved one to rest,&quot; he noted. &quot;That's why health care workers wear protection like gloves and masks. It's why, if you feel sick with a high fever, you should get help right away--because with prompt treatment in a medical center, nearly half of patients can recover. And it's why, when burying someone who died from this disease, it's important to not directly touch their body; you can respect your traditions and honor your loved ones without risking the lives of the living.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the American people, he assured the people of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea that Americans were in daily prayer for the citizenries of those countries, particularly who have lost loved ones during this terrible outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in concert with America's partners around the world, &quot;the United States is working with your governments to help stop this disease. And the first step in this fight is knowing the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Resultant frustration and despair from the situation has driven some Liberians to call for the resignation of the President, particularly if she can't boggle up. The sluggish response of Government to the Ebola crisis resulting into the rapid spread of the pandemic and high death rate has particularly sharpened dissenting voices including the calls for resignation. There has been little or no protestation against the resignation pressures from independent or non-governmental individuals and organizations until a group calling itself North Central Alliance released a strongly worded statement denouncing calls for the President to quit.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The self-styled North Central Alliance (NCA), which claims to a conglomerate of citizens from Nimba, Bong, Lofa, Gbarpolu and Margibi counties, has described as hypocritical and constitutionally baseless a called by certain Liberians for President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and Her Vice President, Hon. Joseph N. Boakai to resign their respective positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thought Vice President Boika is not mentioned in most of the resignation calls, the group claims that the Unity-party led Government's conduct of the state has not created any unconstitutional problem that would warrant the resignation of the Government and usher in an Interim Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the NCA is of the opinion that all is not 100% right, but such a decision is not only counter-productive to the growth of the economy, but would stall the fight against the Ebola disease and prolong the isolation of the country,&quot; the group said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCA believes that the call for resignation is not only legally inadequate, but has the proclivity to short-land the nation's flourishing democracy, undermine the Government and citizens collective efforts in fighting the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) thereby increasing the death rate of Liberians and further provide a sanctuary for a group of ill-prepared Liberians to take state power as done in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the group, it also considers the call as being the work of anti-democratic elements that lack the sufficiency to significantly contribute to the governance process of Liberia and the current fight against the Ebola Virus Disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These detractors of democracy and ill-fated propagandists will not yield its intension to undermine and distract government and international partners' preoccupation in the fight against this national menace that has claimed more than 600 lives already in the country,&quot; NCA said in a statement signed by its President, Jamah Allison Barco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCA wants any party interested in taking state power to properly get organized and do so in 2017 but not when the Government and citizens are busy in dealing with issues of serious national concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the North Central Alliance (NCA) has vowed to mobilize its supporters from Lofa, Bong, Nimba, Gbarpolu and Margibi Counties to resist anyone and any group wanting to usher in an Interim Government which has proven unprofitable in the Liberian political theater.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British nurse infected with ebola is responding well to treatment and has recovered his appetite, his parents revealed today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley, 29, is enjoying bacon butties and is now strong enough to start gentle exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is still being kept inside an isolation tent and may have to stay there for weeks to ensure the infection does not spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley was hailed a hero for his work treating ebola patients in a remote clinic in Sierra Leone after he was struck down with the disease. He was airlifted out of West Africa by the RAF and taken to the specialist isolation ward at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night his parents Robin, 67, and Jackie, 66, beamed with relief as they revealed their son is responding well to treatment, including the experimental drug ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple, who have spent most of the last ten days at the hospital, praised the world class' care he had received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley said: He is able to get out of bed. He has a little step in there that the physio gave him so that he can rebuild his strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That in itself is a good enough sign, I think. But he seems to be pretty well actually.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to have any direct contact with his parents, Will is able to talk to them via a telephone link into the isolation tent. Mr Pooley added: We can stand and see him indistinctly through the glass and the polythene.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Pooley said: He is talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He is interested in more things.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a clear sign of his improving health is his appetite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley said: His appetite has come back. It came back with a bacon butty that one morning for breakfast'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Pooley added: And then we took him a vegetable rogan josh [curry].'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple have revealed that they were at a family wedding when Will broke the news that he had been infected with ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Pooley said: We were at our niece's wedding and he phoned, we're out in the grounds and the photos were being taken. We assumed he'd phoned to wish his cousin every happiness.' The phone was passed around family members, but his father thought Will was sounding flat' and that there was something wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairly soon I rang him back and he told me,' he said. At which point the first thing in mind is, &quot;We can't spoil the day&quot;.' The couple left the wedding early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Pooley said it was a very stressful' and anxious time when all the worst case scenarios' were running through her mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: First of all we worried that he would not get out of the country. There a lot of check points that had to be cleared. He had 160 miles to travel across to get to the airport in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't until the plane had taken off that we breathed a very, very small sigh of relief, we knew he was on his way home.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple say their son is very grateful for the expert case he has received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Pooley said: I think he has feels very glad to be having such good care. He is very aware of what he has left behind.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband added: The fact that the British Government decided that they were going to be his insurance company was absolutely fantastic.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple said they were very proud of Will for the live-saving work he did in Sierra Leone. They hope he will make a full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,500 people have died since the ebola outbreak started in Guinea. The World Health Organisation has warned as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is controlled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EFFECTS OF DEADLY VIRUS FELT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY JAMIE NIMMO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS ebola sweeps across West Africa, the economic repercussions of the deadly virus are being felt further afield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economies of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been left reeling from quarantines, cancelled flights, and limited trade in and out of the region, which has had a knock-on effect on British businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways has suspended all flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia until at least the end of the year after initially cancelling flights for just a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's flag carrier said it made the decision due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BA usually runs four flights a week between Heathrow and Liberia's capital Monrovia, with a stopover in Sierra Leone's capital Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed the shockwaves from ebola, which has a 90pc fatality rate, have been strongest in these two countries, where the death toll has passed 1,500 and national growth targets are under threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three-quarters of Sierra Leone's growth came from mining last year. London Mining, which mines iron ore in the country, was the first company to react publicly by imposing travel restrictions on staff and visitors from the east of Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, the group insisted production at its Marampa mine was unaffected, but has since warned of supply chain issues that are likely to hit output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with a decline in iron prices, London Mining's share price has almost halved in the space of six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a similar story for African Minerals, also operating in Sierra Leone and listed on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Its stock has suffered the same fate, while the search for funds has become more difficult in the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alison Turner, an analyst at City firm Panmure Gordon, admits ebola poses a very real short term risk to mining companies operating in West Africa'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added in an in-depth research note on the subject that the efforts of other countries to stop the spread of ebola, such as restricting travel from affected nations, create a major logistical challenge for companies operating in West Africa'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turner reckons convincing British ex pats to return to the region could become a major problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When staff return to their homes at the end of their rotations they are exposed to the fears of their loved ones and the opportunity to seek alternative employment. Wouldn't you?', she asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smaller mining companies in West Africa have acknowledged delays due to the late arrival of important equipment, while shipping their product has also proved to be a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the heavyweights have also suffered: ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, said the virus has put the brakes on its expansion plans in Liberia; Sime Darby, the world's biggest listed palm oil producer, said its Liberian output is slowing, while Cote d'Ivoire-based Sifca Group has stopped rubber exports from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of supply will mean increased demand and ultimately higher prices for commodities produced in West Africa. That in turn could mean margins are squeezed at supermarkets around the world if a cure is not found soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glasgow-headquartered engineer Weir Group, which makes equipment for mining groups, reported that its mining business suffered a 9pc fall in first-half earnings due to the ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T HAT was while its oil and gas engineering arm registered a 27pc rise in profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the South African mining strikes played a large part in that decline, but ebola was picked out as a major culprit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the disease spreads into neighbouring countries, then FTSE 100 constituents Glencore, which owns the majority of the Perkoa zinc project in Burkina Faso, and Randgold Resources, with operations in Senegal and Mali, could be forced into action. Operating in West Africa, one of the last remaining frontiers for mineral exploration, is now being seen by investors as a black mark on UK-quoted companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsurprisingly, investors have been quick to avoid any exposure to the epidemic, shunning shares in West Africa-focused groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those aware of the pitfalls of AIM will be no strangers to mining companies based in far-flung parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ebola is proving too great a risk to ignore compared with the geopolitical concerns private investors are normally faced with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil and gas industry has not been immune to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has since spread to Nigeria, Africa's biggest producer of oil and the continent's largest economy. Oil giant Shell operates there, along with American majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Robinson, senior credit officer at Moody's, warns that if a major outbreak emerges in the Nigeria's capital Lagos, the consequences for the West African oil and gas industry would be considerable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any material decline in production would quickly translate into economic and fiscal deterioration,' Robinson adds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British nurse who contracted the deadly Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone appears to be recovering and is even enjoying bacon sandwiches, his father said yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will Pooley has been in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital in London since he was flown back to Britain last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday his father, Robin Pooley, said that his son was doing &quot;pretty well&quot; and was sitting up and eating &quot;bacon butties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley, 29, is being given the same drug that was credited with saving the lives of two American missionaries . It had been thought that supplies of ZMapp had run out, but doctors at the Royal Free managed to get hold of some from abroad and Mr Pooley was given the first dose 10 days ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no cure for Ebola, but encouraging results with people who have been given ZMapp suggest that it is the nearest thing to a cure currently available. A study last week suggested that it cured 100 per cent of monkeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sierra Leone, where Mr Pooley was working as a volunteer, patients are given little more than paracetamol and water to stave off fever and dehydration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current outbreak has killed 57 per cent of people who have caught Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes that the first Briton to contract the deadly Ebola virus will make a full recovery have been raised after his father said he was doing &quot;pretty well&quot; and eating bacon butties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurse Will Pooley, 29, is talking more and showing more interest in things around him, indicating that he may be over the worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been in an isolation unit in the Royal Free hospital, north London, for the past eight days after being evacuated from Sierra Leone where he contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a lot better than we thought he might have been . . . he seems to be pretty well actually,&quot; said his father, Robin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley is being cared for by a team of specially trained doctors and nurses and has received the experimental drug ZMapp. There have been no human trials of the potential vaccine, but tests on monkeys have been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley's father told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that his son is having physiotherapy to rebuild his muscles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a little step in there which the physio gave him to rebuild his strength, that in itself is a good enough sign,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His appetite is back. We came back with a bacon butty one morning for breakfast and we took him a rogan josh one evening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days, with symptoms typically showing within 10 or 11 days. In the current outbreak, the fatality rate is around 50%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus, which is spreading across west Africa, has claimed more than 1,500 lives and infected more than 3,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation, which has said as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley's mother, Jackie, told the BBC that her son seemed to be recovering. &quot;He's talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He's interested in more things than he was,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father said they spoke to him through a special telephone unit, and could only see him through glass and sheets of plastic that enclose his bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would be up to his son whether he wanted to return to Sierra Leone or any other country where he put his health at risk. &quot;It is his call, it's always been his call,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley contracted the virus while treating patients at a government hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and part of a quarantine zone in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before contracting the virus, the nurse had said it was wonderful to see patients walk out alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Ebola patient Will Pooley has been in an isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital for</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes that the first Briton to contract the deadly Ebola virus will make a full recovery have been raised after his father said he was doing &quot;pretty well&quot; and eating bacon butties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurse Will Pooley, 29, is talking more and showing more interest in things around him, indicating that he may be over the worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been in an isolation unit in the Royal Free hospital, north London, for the past eight days after being evacuated from Sierra Leone where he contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a lot better than we thought he might have been . . . he seems to be pretty well actually,&quot; said his father, Robin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley is being cared for by a team of specially trained doctors and nurses and has received the experimental drug ZMapp. There have been no human trials of the potential vaccine, but tests on monkeys have been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley's father told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that his son is having physiotherapy to rebuild his muscles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a little step in there which the physio gave him to rebuild his strength, that in itself is a good enough sign,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His appetite is back. We came back with a bacon butty one morning for breakfast and we took him a rogan josh one evening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days, with symptoms typically showing within 10 or 11 days. In the current outbreak, the fatality rate is around 50%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus, which is spreading across west Africa, has claimed more than 1,500 lives and infected more than 3,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation, which has said as many as 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak is contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley's mother, Jackie, told the BBC that her son seemed to be recovering. &quot;He's talking a lot more than he was at the beginning. He's interested in more things than he was,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father said they spoke to him through a special telephone unit, and could only see him through glass and sheets of plastic that enclose his bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would be up to his son whether he wanted to return to Sierra Leone or any other country where he put his health at risk. &quot;It is his call, it's always been his call,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley contracted the virus while treating patients at a government hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and part of a quarantine zone in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before contracting the virus, the nurse had said it was wonderful to see patients walk out alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res urges UN to dispatch disaster response teams as cases and deaths continue to surge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military teams should be sent to West Africa immediately if there is any hope of controlling the Ebola epidemic, doctors on the frontline told the United Nations on Tuesday, painting a stark picture of health workers dying, patients left without care and infectious bodies lying on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international president of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Dr Joanne Liu, told member states that although alarm bells had been ringing for six months, the response had been too little, too late and no amount of vaccinations and new drugs would be able to prevent the escalating humanitarian disaster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In West Africa, cases and deaths continue to surge,&quot; she said. &quot;Riots are breaking out. Isolation centres are overwhelmed. Health workers on the frontline are becoming infected and are dying in shocking numbers. Others have fled in fear, leaving people without care for even the most common illnesses. Entire health systems have crumbled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Ebola treatment centres had been reduced to places where people went to die alone. &quot;It is impossible to keep up with the sheer number of infected people pouring into facilities. In Sierra Leone, infectious bodies are rotting in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than building new Ebola care centres in Liberia, we are forced to build crematoria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation estimated last week that 20,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been infected over three months. MSF has doubled its staff of volunteer doctors in the region but is unable to cope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic can be stopped, said Liu, but only if governments send in their biohazard teams and equipment. &quot;Many of the member states represented here today have invested heavily in biological threat response,&quot; she said at the UN. &quot;You have a political and humanitarian responsibility to immediately utilise these capabilities in Ebola-affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To curb the epidemic, it is imperative that states immediately deploy civilian and military assets with expertise in biohazard containment. I call upon you to dispatch your disaster response teams, backed by the full weight of your logistical capabilities. This should be done in close collaboration with the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without this deployment, we will never get the epidemic under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money is no longer the main issue, according to MSF, and voluntary help is not enough. Skilled and well-equipped teams are needed on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments should send in military and civilian experts who can scale up the numbers of isolation centres and deploy mobile laboratories that can be used to diagnose more cases. Military-style operations are required to establish dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment around West Africa and a regional network of field hospitals must be built to treat medical staff who are infected or suspected of being infected. About a tenth of the deaths have been among health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must also address the collapse of state infrastructure,&quot; she said. &quot;The health system in Liberia has collapsed. Pregnant women experiencing complications have nowhere to turn. Malaria and diarrhoea, easily preventable and treatable diseases, are killing people. Hospitals need to be reopened and newly created.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lastly, she said, there must be a change of approach by affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coercive measures, such as laws criminalising the failure to report suspected cases, and forced quarantines, are driving people underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is leading to the concealment of cases, and is pushing the sick away from health systems. These measures have only served to breed fear and unrest, rather than contain the virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liu was speaking as nurses in Liberia went on strike for better pay and equipment to protect themselves from Ebola. John Tugbeh, spokesman for the strikers at John F Kennedy hospital in Monrovia, said the nurses would not return to work until they are supplied with &quot;personal protective equipment (PPEs)&quot;, the hazmat-style suits that guard against infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the beginning of the Ebola outbreak we have not had any protective equipment to work with. As a result, so many doctors got infected by the virus. We have to stay home until we get the PPEs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surgical section at JFK is the only trauma referral centre in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital closed temporarily in July due to the infections and deaths of an unspecified number of health workers who had been treating Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need proper equipment to work with [and] we need better pay because we are going to risk our lives,&quot; Tueh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has also warned of serious food shortages as a result of restrictions on movement in the Ebola-hit countries. &quot;Access to food has become a pressing concern for many people in the three affected countries and their neighbours,&quot; said Bukar Tijani, Food and Agricultural Organisation regional representative for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the main harvest now at risk and trade and movements of goods severely restricted, food insecurity is poised to intensify in the weeks and months to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rebort A. Sirleaf Foundation has announced the departure from the country of its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert A. Sirleaf to Europe and the United States of America to provide first-hand presentations to international partners on the present state of the Ebola Epidemic plaguing our country, Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sirleaf will use his presentations and interactions with his international colleagues and partners to seek additional assistance for Liberia in furtherance to the national efforts to tackle the spread of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in Monrovia, the Robert Sirleaf Foundation quotes Mr. Sirleaf as saying that it was a tough decision to leave the country during this critical national period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an unfortunate National crisis on our hands, and I know we need all hands on deck to tackle this Ebola crisis, however, this trip compels me to meet with our partners to brief them on what we are doing and how they can assist our country and people. Our people are dying daily and I'm not happy as much as all Liberians. I don't feel good. We do not want a country wherein Ebola is killing our people so we have to do something and do it now&quot; Mr. Sirleaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his departure from the country, Mr. Sirleaf led several efforts by his foundation in raising awareness on how to prevent contracting and spreading the disease and providing support to underprivileged communities throughout Montserrado County, one of the epic centers of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sirleaf who returns shortly to the country has meanwhile, praised the efforts of Health workers in the forefront of fighting the disease, International Responders - the Center for Disease Control-USA, the World Health Organization and Medicine San Frontier (MSF) as well as other well-meaning Liberians for their volunteer expertise and support in helping to kick the deadly disease from Liberia and the sub-sub region.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than hundreds of angry youths at the Schieflin Avenue in Margibi County have protested against persons being secretly buried in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to some of the young people, during the late hours of Saturday, a corpse was taken outside of the Schieflin Town and buried in the area, something some members of them detested and dug the body out of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, when the Inquirer visited the area Monday morning, the Commissioner along with some members of the officials frowned at the behavior of the youths, terming it as wrong and disappointing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Commissioner Gibson, last Saturday, his Clerk received a call from Mr. G. Richmond Karnean I, who is the Shieflin Avenue Chairman concerning burying a person who he said had died in Duport and the corpse has been taken to the area for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Gibson stated further that there was no document proving the body to be free from any disease or Ebola and requested that a stop order be placed on the burial of the person until every necessary requirement is met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently living in fear of the action carried out by the youths of the town; these guys are at large; what is very fearful is that we do not know the root cause of the death of the lady,&quot; Commissioner Gibson stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, according to Chairman Karnean I, on Saturday of last week, a ranking officer of the Armed Forces of Liberia, only referred to as one Hinneh visited him at his residence requesting to bury his mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Karnean said that the AFL personnel was accompanied by a female by the name of Margaret and another guy called Samuel Smith who pleaded to acquire a plot of land to bury the dead person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them, the person who died was the mother of the AFL personnel and that she died three days ago at a local clinic in Duport Road. Mr. Karnean stated that on Sunday at approximately 8:45p.m. a pick-up bearing LNP license plate 1105 accompanied by four Ministry of Health pick-ups drove in the area with the corpse of the dead person followed by Hinneh, Margaret and Samuel Smith intending to bury the lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karnean said, he immediately went on the scene after he was called by angry youths who gathered protesting the woman's being buried in the area. He said, he hurriedly calmed the youths, and engaged one Richard Smith who is accused of giving them the land for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the accused man Smith said that the people produced document, but could not show them the document for perusal, and went to his residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some aggrieved youths went on the rampage and dug out the buried person demanding response and intervention of the Ministry of Health and the Ebola Response Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a whole family is about to be wiped out right in the outskirts of Monrovia if nothing is done urgently to give that community relief from what is suspected as Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting the Voker Mission community in Paynesville yesterday, it was reported by community members within the vicinity that a lady believed to be a Guinean national fled her Police Academy residence due to the death of her husband who was suspected to have died of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without forcing her to return to her community or informing the health team as instructed by the Ebola awareness team, the family of 19 members who are also said to be Guineans hosted her thereby making them20 occupants in the house, until the head of that family (name withheld) began experiencing symptoms similar to that of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a resident, SandoManjoe, they did not know the story of the lady until Sunday afternoon when they called the health team to check the man and wife who had been observed and suspected of having symptoms of illnesses and were very weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manjoe said the health team went into the yard of the family and took blood samples and specimens for testing since Sunday and hours after their departure, the wife died and before the dawn of day yesterday, the husband too passed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said currently, five persons are down with fever which is posing serious fear in the community because the home has not been quarantined and some members of that family are still looking very healthy and might want to escape or go in search of food which might spread the virus if at all it is probable that the virus has entered that home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manjoe said the health team told them upon its arrival that the sick people could not be taken away because there was no more space in any of the Ebola Treatment Centers yet they did not say what will become of the entire family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other community members fear that if police come to ensure that the family is safe and kept from affecting others, that whole community will be quarantined which will affect them therefore called on the health team to remove the family from the community immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most of the community residents said what is best is that the entire community where the family is being suspected of contracting the Ebola virus be quarantined because they are not sure about themselves because they too have interacted with that family.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Liberians continue to seek intervention in the fight against the deadly outbreak of the EBOLA virus in Africa, several local and international non-governmental organizations have begun the distribution of sanitizing-related materials in less-privileged communities aimed at buttressing national efforts to combat the killer disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of such local non-governmental organizations is the Changing Lives International Ministries (CLIM), a non-for-profit Christian based institution which has been catering for under privileged Liberians in some quarters of Monrovia over the past seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, officials of the CLIM headed by its local coordinator, Martin L. Fleming, visited the Royal Community situated in the township of Duazon along the Robertsfield Highway where several sanitizing materials including buckets, chlorides and tie soaps were presented to elderly and under privileged women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Fleming, the materials are part of CLIM's initial effort in helping community dwellers combat the killer EBOLA virus. He acknowledged that 75% of the death from the EBOLA virus are said to be women and as such it is important to identify with the mothers because of their caring role. He admonished the women to use the materials as a means of preventing themselves and their household stressing that EBOLA is a deadly killer disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do not use the buckets for drinking water, neither the tile-soap, chloride for washing your clothes or dishes. These are materials that will help you combat the deadly EBOLA virus by watching your hands every minute and second,&quot; Mr. Fleming warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CLIM Executive further stated that the presentation targets over a hundred and fifty family heads, but quickly noted that a larger portion of their gesture will focus on under-privileged elderly women. He used the occasion to sensitize women of the Royal Community to avoid touching gravely sick people as well as a person who is perceived to have died from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fleming also extended special thanks to their partner Grace Lutheran Church Sturgis in Southern Diakoda, USA, who he said has been very instrumental in making the items available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming the gesture, Mr. Varney Wellah, on behalf of the community's leadership lauded the CLIM for identifying with their community. Mr. Wellah indicated that the presentation was timely because according to him most of the women could not afford to buy the items. He said while it is true that the EBOLA awareness is on several radio stations it is also prudent for such donations to focus on the less privileged communities and women in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing Lives International Ministries is a local and international NGO in the drive to buttress government's efforts and contribute to the process of nation building. Already, CLIM has constructed a 7-room building in the Royal community intended to be used as an elementary school. The idea to erect an elementary school in that community was driven from a survey showing that hundreds of children who are of school going age have less fortunate opportunities to acquire primary education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Teiwah, it was on Friday when she left to sell cassava leaves in the market but later got news from a family member that her aunty was dead so she decided to ascertain the information but unfortunately she went home in the evening, something which she said angered her husband angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said upon her return she was denied entrance to her house by her husband asking her to take her bath with chloride water before entering because he was afraid that she would have contracted the deadly Ebola virus from where she came from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teiwah then took bath as demanded by her husband but was still not given the chance to enter the house so she decided to get others involved by talking to her husband but to no avail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that after several hours of talking with her husband who she only referred to as Moses she then decided to sleep with her little daughter in the next room but to her surprise she heard the voice of her husband screaming her name and when he got closer, he started claiming that he saw a strange man leaving the house and the person was her boyfriend. &quot;I was lying down when he came and hit me and started telling me that he saw a man leaving the house so I tried to explain to him but he couldn't listen. &quot;He started telling me that he no longer loved me because I was cheating on him so he will kill me and it was not his first time. It's something that he often said to me whenever we had problem. While we were still talking that was when he shot my leg and ran away,&quot; Teiwah narrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, the incident happened at about 8:30 p.m. on Friday, August 29, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this paper contacted one of the aunties of Teiwah, Ma Krobu, she confirmed that threatening the life of Teiwah was a regular habit of her husband, Moses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said when she was told about the current problem between Teiwah and her husband she called Teiwah's husband, Moses and tried talking with him but he was uncompromising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teiwah who spent the whole Friday night bleeding from her leg because there was no hospital to treat her due to the current Ebola situation which has caused several hospitals and clinics to be closed and the recent curfew was finally taken to an unknown hospital on Saturday to seek treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Moses Teiwah's husband was arrested Friday night by the Liberia National Police and is currently at the zone-eight Police Depot for investigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Senatorial Aspirant Wants Steps Taken to Reopen Schools</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">929 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Albert Tugbe Chie, one of the senatorial aspirants of GrandKru County, has called on government to reopen schools and that the closure of school should not go beyond the 90 days State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Grand Kru Senatorial aspirant's press statement of August 30, 2014 signed by him, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, &quot;It will take us take about six to nine months to completely eradicate this particular outbreak noting, 'we cannot afford for our schools to be closed for six months and offices could not be operational'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would strongly recommend to the government that appropriate steps be taken in order to open schools after the end of the 90-day State of Emergency period,&quot; Prof. Chie stated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ministry of Education, the Ebola Task Force and other relevant agencies should now start developing plans for the institution of Ebola prevention measures at educational institutions. Offices, businesses and other outfits should begin to operate fully after they have put in place Ebola prevention measures. The government should give consideration to the timely lifting of the curfew and should not plan to extend the State of Emergency beyond the 90 day period,&quot; Professor Chie noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Professor Chie the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) continues to pose a threat to our existence as a nation to our health, educational pursuit, the economy and our general well-being have been compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that Ebola is a new disease in our country which all of us are trying to understand, he continued that it was never part of the health care delivery system of our country and it will also take some time before we fully understand it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further stated that with our productive capacity significantly reduced, real GDP will continue to fall, as the associated economic realities which have and will continue to transcend all aspects of our lives, will be felt by all Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Chie said, &quot;Although our people are still dying of EVD and new cases are emerging, saying we are of the opinion that as a country we have done well at trying to contain the spread of the disease noting firstly, the state of denial is winding down gradually, and many Liberians are now accepting that Ebola is real. The government of Liberia has been doing well also, although there are many challenges to overcome, the MSF and few other international and local NGGOs have shown their presence, but some international health institutions have been very slow adding we should also thank the Governments of China, the USA and those of other countries which have come to our aid. Many private Liberians as well as foreign individuals and businesses are fully involved in the fight. We are of the belief that our country will get the upper hand in the Ebola fight very soon, but that we should not dwell on criticisms but on suggestions on how to improve the system,&quot; Prof. Chie intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Chie said as a nation, we still have challenges to overcome the threat of the EVD, naming the establishment of more testing centers across the country, tracing those who are sick and be able to evaluate their Ebola statuses quickly and establish more isolation centers, better health services for the infected provide basic services to quarantined centers, ensure that those who are infected with Ebola do not die at home (this will eliminate the need for collection of dead bodies from home by the authorities) and ensure that those counties which are Ebola free remain that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Professor Chie the economy has also been compromised and it is a challenge for the Government to stop the economy from crumbling in the absence of the mobilization of the needed financial and material resources to fully stop the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that Grand Kru County, his constituency is still free of Ebola according to information available to him as data available states that the poverty index (using UNMET Needs) is about 78.4 percent, the second highest in the country; this means that in all sectors, education, infrastructure, health, income, etc., his county is at the bottom in a country that is very poor, saying they therefore cannot afford for Ebola to break out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Chie noted that there is no system in place yet in Grand Kru County to check movement of people into the county as Grand Kru has entry points from Maryland County, from Rivergee County, from Sinoe County and entry from the ocean is minimal saying there is an urgent need to mount Ebola assessment facilities at the main entry points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said further that training should now begin for health personnel in the county to handle any outbreak, plus the provision of protective equipment at the various health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Chie disclosed that the county's authority has set up a task force in each of the 12 traditional communities which are presently engaged in awareness. However, these local task forces are faced with problems of logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, his organization, the Friends of Albert Chie, is also involved in the Ebola awareness across the county and has distributed some preventive materials such as buckets, clorax and chlorines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Liberia Professor also frowned on the Sub-regional and Regional solidarity in the Ebola fight describing it as disappointing. &quot;To say the least, the Ebola outbreak which originated in Guinea constitutes a health transgression in the sub-region and we expected full cooperation from all ECOWAS countries and the African Union to bring the Ebola crisis under control,&quot; he intimated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Countries That recently placed restraining orders on Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are simply being obnoxious unnecessarily. It's an unpopular decision which clearly indicates how divided the continent is especially when one part is cuffed by an infection that has snatched the lives of nearly 2,000 persons in the sub-region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia Which Is considered the new epicenter, over 700 persons, including some of the best Liberian medical minds, future leaders as well as foreign doctors have passed. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea do not take solace in losing some of their best citizens at a difficult time in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Are Appalled and flabbergasted by the sudden decision of Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa among other nations to speak xenophobic language against their African brothers at a critical time in their history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Are Reminded by the proverb which says that when your neighbor's house is on fire, do not stand and watch it burn; do something, because tomorrow the same can happen to you. The countries that are restraining nationals from Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone from entry into their areas do not demonstrate good examples of African solidarity. The Ebola disease is completely new to this part of Africa. Experts say it has taken a different trend as oppose to Uganda and Congo where it was first discovered. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that an estimated 20,000 persons could be infected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, 700 Persons have died in Liberia from the disease and 1,000 are reportedly infected. The Ebola fight requires a global intervention especially when the three countries in the region lack the ability, capability and technical aspects to contain the disease that is already in Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Want To encourage the four West African countries to work closely with the WHO, CDC Atlanta, the United States, China and other countries that have shown sympathy for our situations than our Africa brothers who are simply political and xenophobic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's Nothing Xenophobic about Ebola. It's a disease that weren't created by the governments of Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone; therefore, it is preposterous for the rest of Africa to abandon their brethren when they are at war with an enemy they can't see. We are shocked by the way in which our African brothers are treating the four West African countries in the wake of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the monkeys' symptoms, such as excessive bleeding, rashes and signs of liver toxicity, eventually disappeared, the study revealed.</SPAN></P>

The materials include buckets and chlorine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the launch of ROCH Community Outreach Office in Tweh Farm over the weekend, Senator Armah Jallah of Gbarpolu County through his proxy Mr. Sam A Kamara, said raising awareness and educating people are the surest ways to prevent Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have come to identify with you and to buttress your effort in the fight against Ebola. We believe that ROCH is moving in the right direction because community awareness is vital module to save our people in combating this killer disease,&quot; Kamara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told community dwellers about the preventive measures against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamara appealed to the Liberian government to support ROCH community intervention in the fight against Ebola by providing the needed materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks, ROCH's Executive Director Isaiah B. Wisseh said his organization's campaign is geared toward Ebola prevention with focus on public hand washing, house to house education, among others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was only treated for the signs and symptoms associated with the virus, but God is the greatest healer. It was a miracle,&quot; he disclosed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that while at the center, he was regularly tested for Ebola and &quot;by the help of God, my last test was negative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">813 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal has started an emergency investigation, after tracing its first case of Ebola back to a 21-year-old student from neighboring Guinea. After being falsely diagnosed with malaria three days after his arrival in Senegal, he was sent back home to a relative's house. His symptoms included fever, diarrhea and vomiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days later, after Guinea issued a warning that someone had escaped the quarantine, he was diagnosed as carrying the deadly virus. Since then, he has been in quarantine in Dakar and an urgent trace investigation has been initiated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Minister Awa Marie Coll-Seck confirmed Senegal's first case last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a 90 percent death rate for those who contract the virus. So far, over 3,000 people have been diagnosed with Ebola and over 1,500 people have died since the latest outbreak, which has been traced back to last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) last Thursday warned that the epidemic was accelerating and could grow six times larger to infect as many as 20,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is currently no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Japan last week offered to supply over 20,000 samples of an anti-influenza treatment drug to help stop the spread of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experimental drug ZMapp, produced by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, has so far been implemented in a number of successful, but also in a number of fatal, cases. Now, the US has announced the drug will start its first human clinical trials next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of the African Development Bank Donald Kaberuka has made it clear that the economy of Sierra Leone - which has reported the second-highest number of Ebola infections behind Liberia - is suffering. He told Reuters news agency that the country's GDP for 2014 could drop by four percent over last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic is causing people to cancel projects, he warned, and businesspeople are leaving the country. In a press release, however, the bank was more reserved; it said it expected an overall drop of 1.5 percent in the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the WHO has not issued any travel bans, but tourism and trade are still greatly affected, Kaberuka pointed out, as &quot;private airlines have stopped flying to these countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some African countries, such as Kenya, Senegal and South Africa, have issued travel restrictions to the affected nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the year 2014, Sierra Leone's goal had been to export $220 million (167 million euros) worth of diamonds. The country has already announced this goal will not be realized, as miners are afraid to go to work because the diamond fields are located in the hardest hit areas. International personnel is being pulled out of the region. Those factors spell economic trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawian businessman Desmond Dudwa Phiri says he believes many of the economic problems associated with the disease's outbreak will be caused by the continent's &quot;image problem&quot; more than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people think Africa is a country. When they hear bad news from a place in Africa, they think the whole continent is affected,&quot; he says. For this reason, he argues that the current developments in West Africa will spill over into other regions - but not because they have to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christoph Kannengiesser, CEO of the German African Business Association, accuses international companies of not having a nuanced enough perspective on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is being treated - as usual - in the media and is viewed by many people as a continent of crises, wars and disasters,&quot; he told DW, stressing that only a handful of countries have been affected thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kannengiesser is certain of recovery: &quot;Trade relations, import-export relations and the opening of distribution offices - all of this is only going to be postponed to a later date, when restrictions are no longer in place,&quot; he said. He is optimistic that this could all start happening in just a few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the region's image is not only damaged in the West. Malawian businessman Phiri, who is located 6,000 kilometers away from Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, says, &quot;Ebola is a horrible disease. We are all worried. Even here in Malawi, people are cautious. We are making sure that foreigners get medical examinations before they enter the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, hardest hit by Ebola with nearly 700 deaths, is banning ship crews from disembarking in the government's latest attempt to stem the virus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kannengiesser urges businesses not to overreact. The region's &quot;economic heavyweights&quot; - Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal - have been largely unaffected by the crisis, he claims. While his association advises companies in these countries to be on alert, he says there is no need for them to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the mid- and long-term, Africa is not going to be defined by Ebola, but instead by a growing middle class and business-friendly economic policies,&quot; he told DW, adding that Africa is and will remain one of the big growing markets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these times of prevailing national calamity, all hands are called--and expected--to be on deck not only to accelerate the restoration process but also to assure and deepen public confidence and reduce panic and despair amongst the populace. As a home or family would completely run amok in times of trouble when the father is first to flee so it is for a nation when the first family or any member thereof takes early exit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt why eyes and ears have been all out sniffing for the presence and absence of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and any of her family members during this period of Ebola. Nevertheless, the President's most popular son, Robert Sirleaf, has left the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reportedly, he's not absconding, but doing so for every good reason, as The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an unfortunate National crisis on our hands, and I know we need all hands on deck to tackle this Ebola crisis,&quot; said the Chief Executive Officer of the Robert A. Sirleaf Foundation (RASF) as he prepares leaving Liberia. &quot;However, this trip compels me to meet with our partners to brief them on what we are doing and how they can assist our country and people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing Mr. Sirleaf's departure in statement yesterday, the RASF quotes its CEO further: &quot;Our people are dying daily and I'm not happy as much as all Liberians. I don't feel good. We do not want a country wherein Ebola is killing our people so we have to do something and do it now&quot; Mr. Sirleaf.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foundation said the departure from the country of its Chief Executive Officer to Europe and the United States of America was intended to allow him provide first-hand presentations to international partners on the present state of the Ebola Epidemic plaguing our country, Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Sirleaf will use his presentations and interactions with his international colleagues and partners to seek additional assistance for Liberia in furtherance to the national efforts to tackle the spread of the deadly virus,&quot; the Foundation disclosed, and added: &quot;It was a tough decision to Mr. Sirleaf to leave the country during this critical national period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his departure from the country, Mr. Sirleaf led several efforts by his foundation in raising awareness on how to prevent contracting and spreading the disease and providing support to underprivileged communities throughout Montserrado County, one of the epic centers of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former NOCAL Board Chair, who is expected to returns shortly to the country, has meanwhile praised the efforts of Health workers in the forefront of fighting the disease, International Responders - the Center for Disease Control-USA, the World Health Organization and Medicine San Frontier (MSF) as well as other well-meaning Liberians for their volunteer expertise and support in helping to kick the deadly disease from Liberia and the sub-sub region.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of public anxiety over the shortening to 11 Days, the 21-day period earlier announced West Point Quarantine would lasted for, the Government of Liberia has been giving reasons for the lifting the decision of solitude upon the people of West Point Community, saying the quarantine was aimed at giving inhabitants the sense of local leadership in the national fight against the deadly Ebola Disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the Disclosure Monday at a news conference held at the Ministry of Information Cultural Affairs and Tourism on Capitol Hill, the Deputy Minister of Information for Public Affairs, Isaac W. Jackson, said the decision to lift the quarantine of West point results a recommendation to the President and the National Security Council by authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare concerning its works in West Point.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister Jackson indicated that the decision to lift the quarantine on West Point over the weekend was being misrepresented by media report regrettably, referring to what he called &quot;several news stories circulating as to why government lifts the quarantine on West Point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson observed that some media have sunk into bizarre reportage of the issue without verifying information regarding the incident thereby feeding the public with providing wrong information to our people, and added, &quot;The facts are that the government at the weekend lifted the quarantine of West Point... .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tough-talking deputy minister indicated that Health authorities recommended the decision following their work with the West Point Community, recommending that it was now proper and that all of the measures were put in place for a community leadership that would lead the West Point fight against the Ebola Virus in community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackson noted that Health Minister Walter Gwenigale with a team of health workers in West Point recommended the lifting of the quarantine to the president and the National Ebola Taskforce based upon government acted to lift the quarantine with the 10-day period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Health Ministry's recommendation, Deputy Minister Jackson told journalists there was now community leadership in the township of West Point through whom the people of west point will now have to fight against the prevalence of the deadly epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney Jackson furthered that the people of West Point propose their own leadership which was accepted, while they and their health workers endorse the recommendation in lifting the quarantine on West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will know that the President, Her Excellency visited West Point as a way of doing a firsthand assessment to that township; and so the President did that and then the president follow the recommendation,&quot; Jackson explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MICAT boss for Press and Public Affairs averred further that the West Pointers were able to put in place a leadership structure in seven communities, zones and blocks, which he added constituted some of the works the Health Ministry has done that have led to the reopening of the roads into that municipal community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Pointers, Deputy Minister Jackson quoted the Health Ministry authorities, has been able to also put in place their own surveillance team. &quot;They have been able to do their own leadership and contact team in place; and they have been able to do their own distribution team,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Pointers, Jackson also indicated, have met the least benchmarks of taking ownership of the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus onto themselves; &quot;... and because they have been able to do it satisfactory, the MHSW was able to recommend them for the lifting of the quarantine,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that the essence of the quarantine has to do with encouraging them to constitute a local leadership and not impose to create hardship on the people of West Point, Jackson clarified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackson furthered that sufficient attention has been drawn to the existence of the Ebola Virus in that particular West Point community contrary to the wave of denials that had earlier characterized the life of the people in the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, the non-governmental organization Africare/Liberia continues to collaborate with the Bong County Health Team to ensure routine basic primary health services are provided at all Primary Health Care facilities in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With funding from the United States Agency for International Development and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Africare/Liberia is supplying drugs as well as medical and non-medical supplies to protect clinicians while they provide health services to residents of Bong County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak has led to the temporary closure of the county's two major referral hospitals, Phebe and C.B Dunbar, for the past month, and the Ebola virus continues to ravage the central Liberian city of Gbarnga and its suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every month, Africare/Liberia Country Director Mr. Ernest K. Gaie visits Bong County to observe activities at Africare-supported health facilities and projects, and to meet with staff and listen to their challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This August, Mr. Gaie and Africare/Liberia Field Manager George Toe, Jr. visited six Primary Health Care facilities in the county. During the visit, the team observed that Africare-sponsored health facilities were open and medical staff, including support staff, were providing health services and carrying out their normal duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Zebay Clinic in Panta-Kpaai District, the Africare team observed Registered Nurses were mustering coordination among Trained Traditional Midwives to ensure continued healthcare delivery despite the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of clinics remaining open with medical staff present was made perfectly clear as a mother gave birth through the hands of a professional nurse assigned to Zebay Clinic during the Africare team's visit. Knowing that she conceived before the Ebola outbreak, what would have been the outcome for the mother and her infant if the facility was closed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Africare tour, the medical staff at the health facilities called for protective equipment and other support including motivational incentives if they are to remain working during the Ebola attack on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to staff at the various Primary Health Care facilities, Africare's Country Director Mr. Gaie lauded the staff for making the sacrifice to keep the facilities open and promised to work with donors to ensure that all materials needed for staff safety while providing care will be available at the facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gaie said at this critical time the protection of health workers remains his priority in the provision of health services and the fight against the killer Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gaie commended Zebay's staff for bringing forth life into this world on the day of the team's visit and urged them to continue to assist amidst the current health emergency in the country. He then encouraged the mother to serve as an ambassador in her community, informing her colleagues that amidst the Ebola situation in Liberia the clinic still remains the solution to common illnesses and diseases like it was before the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the Mano River Union (MRU) countries, of which Liberia is part, continues to affect all sectors of the country with the health sector bearing the greatest risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease started in the Republic of Guinea in March this year and later spilled over to Liberia, Sierra Leone and now Nigeria. The disease is spread through direct contact with an infected person or through performing cultural practices on corpses that died from Ebola. In Liberia, at least 1,300 cases have been reported with 743 deaths. Health care workers account for 67 of the total deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deaths of health workers from Ebola while saving lives at major health facilities in the country led to the temporary closure of health facilities like the Phebe and C.B Dunbar hospitals in Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to some health workers, the closing of facilities has led to the death of citizens from conditions other than Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, pregnant women are left with no hope to attend government hospitals or private clinics, and some seek Traditional Birth Attendants for delivery. According to the Bong County Health Team, since the outbreak of Ebola in the county and the subsequent temporary closure of the Phebe and C.B Dunbar Hospitals, there is an unprecedented decline in health facility delivery in the Gbarnga and Suakoko areas where the two hospitals are situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak, Health Workers at the two hospitals called on the government to ensure the relocation of the Ebola isolation ward at the Phebe Hospital and to provide Personal Protective Equipment and life insurance among other things before they return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continued closure of these two major health facilities (C.B Dunbar and Phebe Hospitals) signals a slowing pace in the fight against maternal death in the country, especially with the huge population in the health facilities' Gbarnga and Suakoko District host communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three year Accelerated Action Plan (AAP) for Maternal Mortality Reduction developed by the Ministry of Health and its partners seeks to increase the percentage of deliveries conducted by skilled health professionals from 40% to 80%, something that has increased the incidence of Caesarean sections from 2.8% nationally to between 5-15% in every county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AAP roadmap seeks to: Reduce the maternal mortality ratio from 994 deaths per 100,000 live births to 497, reduce the neonatal mortality ratio from 32 deaths per 1,000 live births to 16 and, Reduce stillbirths from 27 per 1,000 live births to 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the AAP, the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Health anticipates achieving these goals by 2015, in line with Goal Five of the Millennium Development Goals seeking significant improvement in maternal health by 2015 globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains unclear whether Liberia will meet the 2015 target specifically in the health sector with mounting challenges that insiders cite to include limited budgetary allocation for health which constitutes just a little over 6% of the national budget, a limited number of trained personnel, poor geographic distribution of available skilled personnel, and low salaries and benefits for existing personnel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Association of Evangelicals of Liberia (AEL)says the National Taskforce on Ebola should be strengthened and expanded to include non-governmental individuals and institutions that would ably reach out effectively to all citizens and residents within both the rural and urban communities nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, AEL has volunteered its services to be included the National Ebola Taskforce in the country, saying that it can assist meaningfully in executing the objectives of the taskforce.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a release issued by the AEL Monday, President of the AEL Board of Governance, Rev. Dr. Nuwoe-James Kiamu, made the comment recently when he donated a token of assorted food items and disinfectants to Patients at the ELWA Hospital in Paynesville, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May I also strongly commend our establishment (AEL) to the government, and call on it to broaden its taskforce,&quot; Rev. Dr. Kiamu, said, adding, &quot;... I volunteer our services in reaching out, especially to rural Liberia where we have very strong presence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kiamu also disclosed that AEL has moved its Ebola interventions to the next level that would directly benefit victims of the Ebola virus in the country. Hefurthered that theAEL is moving beyond sensitization and prevention campaigns to caring directly for Ebola sufferers, their families and communities in postwar Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A release signed by AEL's Advocacy and Communications Officer Mr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. SonponWeah II, further maintained that the AEL recently launched an initiative aimed at providing tokens of food items and disinfectants to Ebola centers beginning with the SIM-ELWA Center in Paynesville, outside Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SIM-ELWA bears the legacy&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kiamu Praised SIM- ELWA for its humanitarian efforts over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said becomes the first beneficiary of the initiative because it's a founding member of AEL and hosts the Headquarters of AEL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIM-ELWA, the Liberian cleric indicated, bears the legacy of hosting and caring for Liberians during desperate national situations, something, Rev. Dr. Kiamu noted, others should emulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled that in June -July 1990, SIM-ELWAhosted and catered to more than 20,000 displaced and desperate people who were whipped out of their homes and made terribly vulnerable, saying that SIM-ELWA has again offered its premises to host and care for desperate victims of another kind of war after about 24 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these two instances, Dr. Kiamu noted, SIM-ELWA has demonstrated significantly John's dictum which state: &quot;Little children, let us not love in word or talk but indeed and in truth (1Jn 3:18, ESV)&quot;, saying in similar manner that James said, &quot;For as the body [separated] from the spirit is dead, so also faith [without works] is dead (Jas 2:26).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the AEL acknowledged SIM-ELWA's immense contributions to Liberia's progress and thank its director and staff for demonstrating Christian love continuously as Liberians seek God's blessings on the ministries here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lauded SIM-ELWA Ebola treatment Centers while sympathizing with the bereaved families whose relatives lost their lives to ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AEL boss also expressed love for and solidarity with the Liberian government and people for their responses to the deadly Ebola virus outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May I also strongly recommend our establishment, AEL, to the government, and call on it to broaden its taskforce for effective outreach into rural parts, Rev. Dr. Kiamu Averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. kiamu then used the occasion to Call on all local and international Partners of AEL, including all Christians and church leaders, especially those of evangelical persuasions in and out of Liberia to awake and rise to the challenge of this deadly Ebola scourge on Liberia and the sub-region, adding, &quot;Either we all fight together as one or we all fall together separately&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AEL is a faith-based, registered and accredited National NGO/CSO established in the 1960s with over500 churches and other agencies of evangelical persuasions in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been involved with church-planting, relief, development; WASH soft/hard wares, good governance, peace-building and advocacy, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the outbreak of the deadly pestilence that has plagued the country, it has been responding to Ebola outbreak through Relief and awareness nationwide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better Future Foundation, BFF, has strongly called on the National Ebola Taskforce, headed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to adopt a Smart Fight Approach in the war against the Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BFF said such approach should lead to immediate reopening of learning institutions from kindergarten to university levels throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued in Monrovia over the weekend, BFF criticized the indefinite closure of schools nationwide by the government under the pretext of the fight against Ebola while video clubs and other entertainment centers remain fully operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that such approach defeats the intents and purposes of the Liberian government's declared war against the Ebola outbreak in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BFF pointed out that the current approach by the Government in the war against the spread of the Ebola Virus Disease without a well-defined containment plan, coupled with the abrupt imposition of a State of Emergency and a Curfew being enforced by armed military and paramilitary forces are causing more harms than good to the country and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BFF, in the statement, signed by its President Augustine Arkoi, also called for reevaluation of the current approach being carried out by the National Ebola Taskforce, describing it as &quot;reactionary&quot; as it has made little or no tangible positive impacts in the fight against Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government must reevaluate the State of Emergency and the Curfew and establish a clear roadmap in its fight against Ebola, otherwise the situation would create more unanticipated problems for the country,&quot; BFF emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Closure of schools as well as placing restriction on school authorities from conducting registration exercises and prohibiting them from engaging in capacity building training for teachers and school administrators by the government is not a Smart Way of combating the Ebola Virus Disease in the country. We, as a country and people, cannot successfully eliminate Ebola Virus Disease in the face of mass illiteracy,&quot; BFF maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Schools should not be closed while video clubs are operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead learning institutions should be used to create more awareness and education in the minds of students from grade school to colleges and universities relative to the dangers of the Ebola virus and its preventive methods,&quot; BFF furthered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to BFF, the halting of learning opportunities for students throughout the country is not only counterproductive to the fight against Ebola but also inimical to national growth and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The indefinite school closure is counterproductive, and has all of the proclivities to retard the socioeconomic growth and development of the Liberian nation and seriously subject it to more brain-drains&quot;, the BFF statement further indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BFF maintains that &quot;Smart Fight by the Liberian Government in the struggle to contain Ebola should ensure that state apparatus including public revenue generating agencies, hospitals and public health delivery systems, as well as line ministries remain fully functional in meeting the basic needs and aspirations of the entire citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Smart Fight against Ebola should further ensure that our country which had just graduated from more than a decade of armed conflict is not, at this time, reduced to a welfare state wherein its people would solely depend on donor support for mere survival,&quot; BFF, among other things accentuated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BFF is a an based NGO that is dedicated to the rebuilding of postwar Liberia; and promotes socioeconomic, international cultural understanding and cooperation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has described as &quot;a hero&quot; a physician assistant at the C.H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Margibi County after full recovery after being affected by the Ebola virus disease and has opted to return to work immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Kandy Kobbah told the Liberian leader that her infection, isolation and subsequent full recovery from the silent killer disease was not the end of the road in her medical service and that she will return to her area of assignment in Kakata to resume normal duty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Kobbah in tears said though she had gone through all the pains, agony and isolation as the result of the disease, she will continue to provide service to the people even in these difficult times and will use her status as a survivor to educate those that are of the notion that the disease does not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, Mrs. Kobbah made the assertion Saturday, August 30, when she and a Congolese doctor, Sengo Oneoga, where discharged from the Liberian-run Ebola Treatment Center at the ELWA Hospital following full recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Oneoga who has been living and working in Liberia for the past three years got infected while treating Ebola patients in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were both treated with the Zmapp drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking when she received the two health workers, President Sirleaf expressed appreciation that Liberians were taking ownership and was further encouraged by the motivated health workers at ELWA Ebola Treatment Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing would have made me happy further other than Mrs. Kobbah's zeal and determination to save life even at her own risk,&quot; President Sirleaf said when she addressed health workers at the C.H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata City, adding, &quot;As a government we must do all within our power to keep health workers safe as they save lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She repeated government's commitment to improving the working condition of health workers across the country as the process of improved incentives and benefits were being finalized to benefit all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf admonished health care workers at the C.H. Rennie hospital to make use of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) as they copy the example of Mrs. Kobbah in her demonstration for love of the profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the hospital, the Margibi County Health Team briefed President Sirleaf with regards to the strategy being used by the county-level Ebola Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the county authorities, they have made progress in urging the local communities to take ownership of the fight; a method they say has worked so well thereby leading to successfully breaking transmission in Dolo's Town in lower Margibi County which was hardly hit by the virus due to traditional burial practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consultant to the county health team, Dr. Francis Ketteh, informed President Sirleaf that as part of the fight against the Ebola virus disease, they have planned to build their own treatment center in the county to avoid taking patients to the ELWA treatment center in Paynesville which he said sometimes turned back patients due to lack of space. The Liberian leader welcomed the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She promised central's government cooperation with the Margibi County authorities to create the guest house, under construction, owned by the county into a treatment center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf's visit to Margibi County also took her to the Firestone-Liberia run Du-side Hospital where she was also briefed by hospital authorities about their intervention in the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du-side Hospital's Chief Administrator, Dr. Lyndon Mabande informed the Liberian President that they have managed to keep the hospital opened for regular illnesses while an observation and treatment center operated by company operates as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PricewaterhouseCoopers, (PWC) Liberia LLC, an international auditing firm with branch in Liberia has made a cash contribution of one thousand United States dollars to the Town Center Community located in the Township of New Georgia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation, which was made on Friday, August 29, 2014 when community and the collection of youth organizations under the banner Association of Youth Organization launched anti-Ebola awareness, is in support of efforts being exerted by the National Taskforce, businesses, private and public financial institutions, international and local non-governmental organizations to contain the Ebola viral disease (EVD) that is ravaging Liberia..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the contribution on behalf of PWC, Mr. Tweh Tommy said it was the company's way of helping the community during this period of national emergency where everyone is endeavoring to stand up to the fatal Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PWC official thanked the Council of Elders and the Youth Association of the community for the farsightedness in undertaking such anti-Ebola initiative, adding &quot;the battle against Ebola can only be won collectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called on others to emulate the example of his institution by making financial and material contributions to the National Taskforce or communities that are aiding the efforts of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to PWC-Liberia's gesture, Rev. James Togba who spoke on behalf of the community said thanked the entity for coming to aid of the community dwellers as they buttress the efforts of the government through the National Taskforce to beat back Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they do not have any confirmed or suspected Ebola cases in their areas, Rev. Togba said it was necessary to take preventive measures, and added that &quot;the success of the anti-Ebola campaign was based on the contribution made by the PWC and individuals in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are overwhelmed and very appreciative that PWC, regardless of the short notice, was able to reach us, enabling us to take the messages and preventive measures to our people,&quot; Rev. Togba said. &quot;The amount will be used for the intended purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, called on the Government of Liberia, the business communities, local and international partners to take the Ebola fight to the community level, and noted that proactive actions at the community levels will ensure success against the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 3,069 persons have been infected with the virus with 1,552 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria as of August 26, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) says in its latest report on the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it's an incredibly brave thing to agree to do and, even though those given the vaccine will remain anonymous, we should all be thankful for their selfless contribution to helping fight this horrific disease. The trial is being coordinated by Oxford University, and the vaccine developed with a &pound;2.8 million grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm immeasurably proud that this country is leading the way in finding treatments in the fight against and prevention of Ebola.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items, the Deputy Minister of Health for Administration, Mr. Matthew Flomo, expressed delight and thanked the NOCAL Board, Management and staff for the contribution to the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presentation, he said, was being made at a time when there is a dire need to have more PPEs in the various Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs). It is a requirement, Mr. Flomo noted, that each nurse, midwife or Physician Assistant attending to a patient in the ETU wears a brand new PPE, &quot;So it means that there is continual need to have more PPEs,&quot; he emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health &amp; Social Welfare official assured the NOCAL management that transparency and accountability would be key in the usage of the materials being presented to combat the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items presented included two hundred (200) pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), worth over US$84,000.00 (Eighty Four Thousand United States dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's presentation represents another major contribution NOCAL has made towards the national effort to contain the spread of the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. Last week, NOCAL contributed several materials to a local Non-Governmental Organization, 'Feed the Future' in its effort to support the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of efforts to eradicate the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has claimed the lives of several people and leaving many others affected in Liberia, the Monrovia Breweries Incorporated (MBI) commonly known as Beer factory has donated about three thousand buckets, an amount of L$100,000, along with Ebola educative materials to the people of the Borough of New Kru Town, Duala and other communities and its customers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation which was made over the weekend was done as part of the company's cooperate social responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the Monrovia Breweries Incorporated and the General Commercial Manager, Mr. Nelson Oniyama, the Marketing and Customer Relations Manager Thelma Dennis said the donation is intended to buttress the government of Liberia's effort in fighting the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the company's involvement is not politically motivated but rather a way of identifying with the people of Liberia during this critical period where the issue of the deadly Ebola virus has become a National Embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marketing and Customer Relations Manager asserted that in order for Liberia to win the fight against the deadly Ebola virus, the situation should be seen as everyone's problem and not a government's problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She disclosed that the company initially distributed over one thousand buckets including chlorides to several communities and is expected to continue its distribution in some counties specifically Grand Bassa and Nimba disclosing that the recent donation in New Kru Town and other communities worth over Forty thousand United States dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Dennis however noted that her company is in support of any decision made by the government of Liberia in ensuring that the deadly Ebola virus is eradicated adding that the donation was made possible through the tireless efforts of the Monrovia Breweries' Incorporated General Commercial Manager, Mr. Nelson Oniyama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Thelma Dennis has called on every Liberian to take the Ebola issue seriously in order to protect them noting that the purpose of the buckets is for people to continuously wash their hands to ensure that they are saved from the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jefferson D. Tweh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1132 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Saturday morning, August 30, 2014 was a scene of jubilation in the densely populated community of West Point after the opening of the road leading to their community by the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area was one of two communities that were quarantined by the Liberian government as part of measures to avoid the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. The government took the action after some residents looted a health center in which some suspected victims of the disease were being treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after news of the lifting of the quarantine was received, residents of the township went wide with jubilation. Some of them took to the streets in their areas, while others went to central Monrovia, dancing and singing for the lifting of the restriction on them for the past days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they jubilated, they chanted slogan, such as&quot; there is no Ebola in our community.&quot; They congratulated Representative Saah Joseph, presidential aspirant, Mr. Benoni Urey, humanitarians, charitable organizations, civil society organizations, human rights groups and international partners for the great support given them in the Township at the time they were quarantined by the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to residents of West Point, they are now happy to have access to free movement in Montserrado County and do their normal businesses in Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are actually pleased to see our road being opened today because things have been very difficult with us over the past weeks, despite the donations made by humanitarians in our community, but there was no free movement at all and we were in fear because of the lack of free movement, as the area was policed by state security,&quot; West Pointers stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the West Pointers have accused Representative Solomon George of not seeking or paying attention to them at the time their community was quarantined and described him as 'good for nothing' and promised to vote him out come 2017 Presidential and General Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an executive interview with this paper, the Commissioner of West Point, Madam Miatta Flowers, has lauded President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and her government officials for the opening of West Point Road and allowing the residents of West Point to move anywhere in Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Flowers has also applauded the International Partners, humanitarians, Civil Society Organizations, Charitable Organizations, Some members of the National Legislature, Government of Liberia, Non-Governmental Organizations and Human Rights Groups for the significant contributions made to the residents of West Point Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Flowers has called on the West Pointers to be peaceful and continue to be law abiding citizens in the country. She appealed to the residents of West Point to take preventive measures as prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare because Ebola is real and nobody should take it for a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will continue to demonstrate my commitment as Commissioner in this Township of West Point and work along with my people to make sure that good things come in this community,&quot; Madam Flowers concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident of West Point who spoke to our reporter, Mr. Daniel Sekey, said he was really disappointed in the Government of Liberia to have prevented the West Pointers from going about freely because as far as he was concerned there is no Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the Government of Liberia quarantined our community over the past days, nobody experienced any sign of the Ebola virus or got sick,&quot; Mr. Sekey stated further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sekey alleged that the Government of Liberia did that just to punish the West Pointers and impose more sufferings on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My brother, just tell me; you are a journalist and you have been doing research on the Ebola issue; is that fair for government to quarantine West Point Community without Ebola?,&quot; Mr. Sekey asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the marketers who also spoke to our reporter, Ma-Kebbeh said the first thing that the Government of Liberia would have done was to screen the people in the West Point Community, instead of the quarantine exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She admitted that Ebola is real but the action taken by government was not in the right direction because people were actually stranded and there was no way to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ma-Kebbeh, commodity prices were high in West Point and people were finding it difficult to survive due to the closure of the road, but with the help of humanitarians, they made residents to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ma-Kebeh is calling on the young people of West Point not to engage in any unlawful acts that will tarnish the image of the Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a relative development the program director of the Street Child Liberia (SCOL) Mr. Michael John Bull, on Saturday also lauded the government of Liberia for what it called a &quot;wonderful decision&quot; to open the blockade set-up to quarantine the residents of the Township of the densely populated area of West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf about a fortnight ago declared a State of Emergency and ordered security officers to quarantine the Township of West Point as a measure to curtail the spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. John Bull speaking to journalists at the organization's headquarters said he was overwhelmed with joy to see members of SCOL including their relatives and others free to move about once more after being quarantined for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bull said humanitarian services are critical and cardinal to the survival of Liberia's development agenda. The Program Director of SCOL said this is why his organization, a non-governmental, non-political saw the need of the West Pointers and decided to aid them with some Ebola preventive materials including bags of rice, Argo oil, and others while they were quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. John Bull disclosed that he saw that West Pointers were suffering and wondered what would have happened two weeks from now if the quarantine was not lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the program director said he had already made arrangement for about 200 bags of charcoal to be given also to the West Pointers to help them cook their food as they were no longer quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Bull warned members of his organization and other citizens of West Point not to take their freedom as a yardstick to do anything out of the preventive measures provided by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola is real, Ebola exists, be careful more than before and take the necessary precautions to avoid the spread of the deadly Ebola virus,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed that SCOL still has more buckets for washing of hands, powdered soap and other preventive materials to be distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that SCOL, an advocacy group with support with Street Child United Kingdom provided nearly US$10,650.00 in food, Ebola preventive materials among others for their members in West Point.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">834 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I had stated in many of my articles on West Point, it is special to me because it was one of the areas I was assigned as a young reporter in the early 80's. Because of that, I considered the area, commonly known as &quot;THE KEY&quot; because of its one-way road network, as my second home, apart from New Kru Town where I hail from. As such, whenever there are issues concerning the area, I am always concerned and try to share my experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few days ago, when it was reported that some residents of the ransacked and looted health center where some suspected Ebola patients were being treated, I took issue with those looters. The article was written under the caption, &quot;Looting In West Point: Have The Residents Realized The Implications?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that piece, I emphatically stated that &quot;many times people associate the name, West Point with all kinds of bad, unbecoming or unwholesome behavior and attitude, something I always oppose, and so to see what was done last week, &quot;full my mouth,&quot; to say it the Liberian way. I noted that the looting has now given those who always speak disparagingly about the township and its people, more reason for their belief or perception about the area and its people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I went on to say that, &quot;for looting, ransacking and vandalizing a health facility that made major headlines, the people of the township should now beware that they have added insult to injury that would always be projected negatively&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that piece I acknowledged that, as an apologist of the people, the act may not have been carried out by all of the residents, and I stated that the few that carried out that lawless act have now caused aspersion to fall on the entire residents, as it is said, &quot;The righteous shall suffer for the unrighteous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I then pointed out that for some of us who always defend them, when people try to cite the area whenever bad things happen in society; they have now made our case a very difficult one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after the looting, the government of Liberia announced that the area and Dolo's Town in Margibi county would be quarantined for 21 days, as there was fear of possible spread of this Ebola virus, as there was belief that some of the looters may have been infected with the virus which may cause an epidemic in that area. The decision of the government was received with protest action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after about 10 days of quarantine, the government has lifted the restriction, a decision that was received with euphoria by residents. There was high jubilation, including dancing and signing by residents, some of whom came to the center to celebrate the lifting of the restriction on them. As they jubilated, they chorused, &quot;There is no Ebola in our community; thank to Representative Saah Joseph and others for helping us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the residents showered praises on all of those, including organizations local and international, who they said identified with them during the time of the quarantine exercise. The residents in their mood of ecstasy said they were so much exultant to have access to free movement in Montserrado County and do their normal businesses in Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the ending of the quarantine exercise in the areas is a welcoming new because this indicates that the government is convinced that after few days of quarantine, it was time for the restriction to be lifted, as there was no Ebola threat anticipated because of the looting. One source in government told me upon hearing the lifting of the restriction that the government's action was based on the advice of the Health Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, to date, the time of the lifting of the restrictions, there were people who believe that the quarantine was not necessary. To this, I say a BIG NO. The exercise was necessary because of the looting of the health center that had some Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frankly, given the nature of the virus, there was reason for concern because a person can be infected with the virus by coming in contact with a victim. And so the quarantine was necessary for the good of the people, as the area were strategically located and at the same time, densely populated and that any outbreak could have serious consequences on a large population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the government has lifted that restriction, let the word go forth to the people of my second home that the war against this deadly disease is not over. In their jubilation, they should never forget about the preventive measures that were announced by the government to prevent the spread of this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that when this disease first came in March, reportedly from Guinea, this country was successful in containing, for which we became complacent, and thought &quot;all was well &quot; until it hit again after a lady infected with the virus came from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, the people of West Point must take note from this and guard themselves, as it is said, PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE,&quot; and worst of all, this is a disease that has no cure thus far. Hence, the best way out is PREVENTION! I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation included twenty-six Ebola buckets, 20 bags of rice, five cartons of Argo oil, PPE, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation at the C. H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINCE THE EBOLA outbreak in Liberia there have been several donations made in cash as well as in kinds from the international community, individuals, and non- governmental organizations to help fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO DATE, THOSE who have made donations include the Government of Liberia, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Organizations, the Chinese government, Ecobank-Liberia, the World Lebanese Culture Union in Liberia, the Indian Community in Liberia, some churches, Medicare Insurance, Touching Humanity in Need of Kindness, the Rotary Club of Monrovia and the IB International, the Lion's Club, Winner's Incorporated, Arcelor Mittal, and the Rural and Renewable Energy Agency, just to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS WERE made also and few persons still being remembered are Mr. Christopher Neyor, Luther Tarpeh, the Friends of Urey, Mr. Robert Sirleaf and Vice President Joseph Boakai who is said to be touring the counties especially in the Ebola affected counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS ALSO no secret that some political parties joined in the fight against the virus and they include the Congress for Democratic Change, the ruling Unity Party, and the Liberty Party. Other donations were made unannounced as well to the National Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that the National Task Force needs to give a full account of these contributions made so far so that public speculations cannot be entertained because as we always said, 'to whom much is given much is expected.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOME PEOPLE ARE waiting to hear the report before making their initial or full contributions as some of the contributions already made are noted to be initial contributions and we believe that it will only become full when the contributor is guaranteed that the donation is expended for the intended purpose and that can only be done through information sharing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE DEMAND THE full report of these donations because Liberia as a gullible society, feeds on every information whether it is true or false and some donations were made directly to the Task Force while some were made to a Task Force representative in the affected communities; yet still, some under political motives with the Task Force not being in the know therefore we call on the National Task Force in the fight against Ebola to make its report as a means of clarity and accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS REPORT SHOULD also target the number of survivors of Ebola as well as those who were not effected but taken to the treatment centers on suspicion and are now treated of their ailment and set free. We believe that this information could be a remedy of relief if not put to end the widespread fear about the isolation centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, WE URGE the Task Force to act now by giving an in-depth report on how far it has come in terms of the donations made whether meager or huge, initial or full and how it has been expended as well as the balance on hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NATIONAL TASK Force on the fight against Ebola owes it to the public and if the public outcry should begin because of speculation based on failure to inform the people, our international partners will see us as people who are not prepared to get rid of Ebola from this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT IT IS said that, 'where your money is, there your mouth should be also.' A HINT TO THE WISE IS QUITE SUFFICIENT!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of intensive temporal efforts to combat the spread of the Ebola epidemic, which include nighttime curfew, quarantining of communities deemed grand zero, and the introduction of trial medication, a silver lining is appearing in the otherwise gloomy sky - guardedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Liberian Council of Church (LCC), the spiritual and moral guardian of the nation, believes this is no time for the nation to rest on its oars. It is accordingly calling for all to bow before their Creator in entreaty. The Analyst, reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Council of Church (LCC) has announced that it will begin a nationwide weekly prayer and awareness campaign beginning Friday, September 5, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekly prayer and awareness campaign, LCC said, is in continuation of the spiritual intervention of the Christian Community in the fight against the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LCC's weekend statement signed by the National Prayer Committee Against Ebola, said it is launching the weekly spiritual intervention in collaboration with leading member institutions of the Christian Community, including the Pentecostal Fellowship Union, Association of Evangelicals of Liberia, Liberia Fellowship of Full Gospel Ministers Association, Christian Community of Liberia, and the Apostolic World Christian Fellowship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debut service, which will be based on Christian Apostle Paul's call at 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18 for &quot;unceasing prayers&quot;, according to the LCC statement, will begin at midday at the Old Providence Baptist Church on Broad and Center streets in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement added, &quot;The Liberian Council of Churches therefore requests all national and local churches to encourage their prayer warriors and/ or teams to form a part of this weekly prayer campaign beginning Friday, September 5th, 2014 to pray for the elimination of Ebola from Liberia and for the peace and stability of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, we are required in I Thessalonians 5:17 and 18 to &quot;Pray without ceasing&quot; and to give thanks in everything for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. It's time to pray. Let's not grow weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint NOT [Galatians 6:9].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a special LCC called meetings attended by the nation's Christian spiritual leaders on July 30, 2014 at the St. Stephen Episcopal Church, the Liberian Christian Community resolved to hold a 3-day stay-home prayer action against the spread of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action, they believed, would serve as an enhanced response to the fight against the deadly epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, LCC President Jonathan Hart encouraged fellow spiritual leaders to &quot;close rank and collaborate with national stakeholders to fight the disease out of the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convinced that the epidemic has a spiritual dimension that borders on possible Divine punishment against Liberians for their sins, the gathering Christian leaders sanctioned a prayer action after the prescriptions of 2 Chronicle 7:13-14. The citation requires a remorseful people of God to &quot;humble themselves and pray, seek His face and turn from their wicked ways... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special gathering of Christian spiritual leaders challenged the 9-man Adolphus During committee that grew out of their deliberation to plan and execute the prayer program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On day one of the 3-day stay-home fast and prayer action, which began on August 6, 2014, the Council urged Christians across the country to acknowledge the grace and blessings of their Creator on families, communities, and the nation. It also encouraged them confess their sins and repent as they did so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On day two, the Council called for prayers for mercy, forgiveness, and reconciliation. The third and final day focused on healing, restoration, and prayer for spiritual, moral, and physical restoration in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spiritual event ended with thanksgiving and praise services at various Christian churches on August 10, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LCC's latest call for continued entreaty for Divine intervention in the combat against the spread of the deadly Ebola epidemic, observers say, would mean one of two things. Either the Council is seeking God's accelerated response (it being dangerous for the nation to rest on its oars at this delicate moment) or it is unconvinced that the early August spiritual events were far-reaching and sincere enough to exact God's immediate favorable response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever is the reason, the call is clear: all knees must bow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Oil Company of Liberia has presented a consignment of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare to help the Ministry in its fight against the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President and CEO of the company, Dr. Randolph A. K. W. McClain who made the presentation on Friday, August 29, at NOCAL's head office in Monrovia, said the donation was in response to a request from the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry had appealed for assistance to help it contain the spread of the Ebola virus in Liberia. The gesture, Dr. McClain said was also intended to identify with the work of the Ebola Social Mobilization Committee of the Ministry of Health. The NOCAL President hoped the materials presented would be used to protect health workers and others who may be involved in the effort to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items, the Deputy Minister of Health for Administration, Mr. Matthew Flomo, expressed delight and thanked the NOCAL Board, Management and staff for the contribution to the fight against Ebola. The presentation, he said, was being made at a time when there is a dire need to have more PPEs in the various Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a requirement, Mr. Flomo noted, that each nurse, midwife or Physician Assistant attending to a patient in the ETU wears a brand new PPE, &quot;So it means that there is continual need to have more PPEs,&quot; he emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health &amp; Social Welfare official assured the NOCAL management that transparency and accountability would be key in the usage of the materials being presented to combat the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items presented included two hundred (200) pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), worth over US $84,000.00 (Eighty Four Thousand United States dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday's presentation represents another major contribution NOCAL has made towards the national effort to contain the spread of the Ebola epidemic in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, NOCAL contributed several materials to a local Non-Governmental Organization, 'Feed the Future' in its effort to support the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation, Heath Ministry officials said, is an essential boost to ongoing efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National and international supports, particularly in terms of material and financial contributions, to the fight against the vicious Ebola virus have been favorable if not massive. And there has been emerging concerns about how much of those contributions will actually trickle down to the most needed, for instance medical staff in the frontline and the virus-stricken victims. A group of Liberian civil society organizations (CSOs) has, amongst other things, made the monitoring of the flow and dispensing of financial and material resources committed to the fight against Ebola a key strategy of its intervention. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian civil society, at least a segment of it, has responded to government's call for a collective and concerted approach to the Ebola crisis, grouping them into a coalition to form a common front.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst activities set out for its intervention, the group said is the establishment of a &quot;Situation Room&quot; that will monitor the Government's response to the Ebola crisis, assessing citizens' access health facilities which are reportedly announced reopened by government since the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement signed by Oscar Bloh, Chairperson, National Civil Society Council of Liberia Taskforce on Ebola, the group said this is intended to help ensure the level of accountability in the use of resources by the National Taskforce and to analyze the trend of the Ebola pandemic and its social, economic and development implications on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CSOs, they have recognized the efforts by the Government and its international and national partners in containing the spread but that the lack of independent monitoring could risk meaningful efforts and contributions to waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other activities earmarked for implementation by the CSOs include community outreach in eight counties--Montserrado, Bassa, Margibi, Bong, Lofa, Nimba, Bomi and Gbarpolu--in order to create awareness on the mode of transmission of the virus and methods of prevention; accompanied by the distribution of posters containing awareness messages, and the production of spot messages on the prevention of the virus that are being aired on 44 community based radio stations and 5 stations in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group further said it would engage in the production of preventive spot messages in the local languages mainstreaming the voices of local, traditional and religious leaders, and the provision of food and hygienic materials to the quarantined communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming weeks, the CSOs said their taskforce will also undertake the production and screening of an audio-visual documentary in target counties to create awareness on the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also promised to support calls by some members of the National Legislature, the Liberian National Red Cross and other opinion leaders that the management of the Ebola response is turned over to experienced international humanitarian organizations, while the role of the government should be to monitor and support the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian CSOs has also committed on the state of emergency declared by President Sirleaf, asserting that the government needs to say what types of citizens' rights are being restrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also important that the government demilitarize the EBOLA response and ensures accountability of the actions of security personnel,&quot; the group said. &quot;In pursuit of accountability and in keeping with its legal mandate (Article III, Section 1), the Independent National Commission HR should urgently conduct an investigation from a human rights perspective of the West Point shooting on August 18 that led to the death of one person and come up with an independent report and recommend prosecution and compensation for the victims if a violation occurred in keeping with the June 25, 2009 amended portion of Article VIII of its Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group urged Government must demonstrate the political will to commit more state resources and allocations must be prioritized in favor of health and social responses rather than towards security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government's recent disbursement statistics of US$5 million made available to the fight against the Ebola Virus Disease leaves a lot to be desired and it speaks to the government's priorities,&quot; said the CSOs, adding that the Sirleaf administration should realign its own funds to reflect a higher degree of priority for the health and prevention components of the war on Ebola by ensuring that no less than 80% of such funds go to this component of the anti-Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSOs opined that while it is true that containing the spread of the virus in Monrovia is more difficult due to population and movement of citizens, it is equally important that logistics, drugs, PPE materials and financial resources are decentralized to the County Health Team so that the government's response can be felt in other counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the scale at which the virus has spread, it is imperative that additional treatment centers are established to respond to calls from families and community members,&quot; the group, calling on government to beef-up its response mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to CSOs contact tracing plays an essential role in the fight against the spread of the virus as such it must be given equal attention by the National Taskforce stressing that a strategy needs to be urgently developed involving diverse actors from different professional backgrounds to buttress other responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience of CSOs from the field reveals that local authorities don't have a plan to respond to the rapid transmission of the virus, they said, and added: &quot;Hospital facilities are already overwhelmed with new cases and are incapacitated to respond adequately to cases reported from local communities across Liberia. It is therefore important that community participation and mobilization forms an integral part of the overall response strategy in terms of decisions to establish additional treatment centers since community members are likely to be receptive to measures they participate in thereby supporting the government in its response plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents are also appealing to government to ensure the reopening of the Phebe and C.B Dunbar Maternity Hospitals in Bong County.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK- Liberia Ebola Taskforce established by the Union of Liberian Organizations in the United Kingdom (ULO-UK) has airlifted the first of two consignments of assorted protective medical supplies to Liberia to assist the Government in the fight to eradicate the deadly Ebola virus from the country. The supply is expected to arrive in Liberia over the weekend on SN Brussels airline.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Liberia Dental and Medical Association in the United Kingdom who spearheads the initiative on behalf of ULO-UK, the initial supply will be sent to the Phebe Hospital in Suakoko, Bong County because of the vast catchment communities that benefits from that regional referral hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital has been closed for a little over three weeks because of fears by health workers to contract the Ebola virus due to the lack of protective equipment to treat suspected cases of Ebola at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of ULO-UK who physically participated in stocking the materials including Dr. Kokulo Waiwaiku, Dr. Velma Troko, Dr. George Flahn, Mrs. Lena Marshall, Mrs. Evelyn DeShield and Mrs. Robena Vincent, the plight of medical practitioners in Liberia who have lost their lives in the execution of their duties is of great concern and everything should be done by all Liberians to encourage their return to active duty. They described health workers as true professionals and promised to support them in whatever way possible to bring relief to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items included in the shipment are Anti-bacteria gel, disinfectants, surgical scissors, infra-thermometer, disposable aprons, face masks and orthopedic instruments amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort of ULO-UK was complimented by the Liberian Embassy in the UK who negotiated with SN Brussels Corporate Office in London for airlifting the 1200 kilograms of medical supplies to Liberia on gratis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, this measure remains necessary to decongest government work places as efforts continue to contain the spread of the Ebola virus disease which is having devastating consequences on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader has assured government employees affected by the stay-home orders that they will continue to receive their salaries during the period of their absence from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, July 30, President Sirleaf, in a Special Statement to the Nation on additional measures in the fight against the Ebola virus disease, announced that all non-essential staff begin a 30-day compulsory leave; noting the strategy was to contain the spread, care for the afflicted with the goal of &quot;No New Cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Liberian leader instructed the lifting on the quarantine of the Township of West Point on Saturday, August 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf's action is based on the advice of authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare as well as consultations with local and international partners involved with efforts aimed at containing the further spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also indicated that residents' cooperation and support over the period heightened the decision to lift the embargo on the Township of West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, August 19, the Government of Liberia announced that the communities of West Point in Monrovia and Dolo's Town in Margibi County were quarantined effective Wednesday, August 20, beginning at 6:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was first traded that President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's youngest son, Adama Sirleaf, had fled the country with his international medical experts who were providing useful services before the advent of the deadly Ebola virus, accusing him of abandoning the nation while a national emergency needing the skills and expertise of his profession was taking its toll under the regime of his mother. As if that rumor was not enough to hammer down Mr. Sirleaf, then flares another gossip that the President's son was particularly recalled from abroad by his mother to Liberia to have him oversee and personally direct national and international donations and assistance being amassed to fight the killer Ebola virus. It seems the rumor-mongering and gossip has overflowed the patience of Mr. Sirleaf, as The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's youngest son, a medical doctor, has warned against the politicization of the health emergency that has befallen Liberia. She said politicians should stop politicizing the Ebola crisis, stressing that calamity being faced is not a political matter but serious problem affecting the lives and wellbeing of citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking the regular press briefing at the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism in Monrovia last Wednesday, Mr. Adama Sirleaf responded the rumors lingering then that he was pressurized by his mother to come to Liberia to oversee human and material resources being committed to the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was in the country at his own volition and because of his commitment to his country and not because his mother is the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sirleaf obtained his Doctor of Medicine degree from Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN and completed his emergency medicine residency at Metropolitan Hospital Center, New York, N.Y. He completed his Pre-Med studies at Atlanta University, Atlanta, GA and obtained his undergraduate degree at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sirleaf has served as an Emergency Department Attending Physician for several hospitals in the United States, and has been a Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine at Yale University School of Medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the MICAT press briefing, he strongly refuted cynics' postulations that his coming to Liberia was meant to capitalize on the millions of dollars pouring into the country in Ebola-related aid under his mother's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He bragged that he is a Physician working at a renowned hospital in Georgia, the United States, and can afford to support his family there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Sirleaf, he has come to Liberia to identify with his country in areas of need where he, as a trained physician, can make an impact, contrary to cynics' view that his coming is to use the opportunity to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sirleaf has made numerous humanitarian trips to Liberia, working closely with the JFK Memorial Hospital. Through his instrumentality, several US-trained health practitioners have volunteered their services in Liberia, treating many Liberians for hypertension, mental seizures, tooth aches and other infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the suspension of his health program, Dr. Sirleaf stated that he obviously could not bring physicians into the country at this time amidst the Ebola outbreak, noting that American doctors who typically accompany him on humanitarian missions are not Ebola experts could easily contract, something he noted send a bad signal about his program and the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's son is the Chairman of the Board and a Founding Member of HEARTT (Health Education and Relief Through Teaching) and also is a senior attending emergency physician at Bridgeport Hospital, Connecticut the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the immense benefits associated with his profession in the United States, he said, he has not hesitated to get involved in Liberia's rebuilding exercises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through his HEARTT, Dr. Sirleaf said has focused on educating and empowering local health care providers by helping to improve the healthcare delivery system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, on Friday, August 29, held talks with officials of the Alliance for Peace and Democracy (APD) at her Foreign Ministry office in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The APD requested the meeting to discuss how they could be of help in the national fight against the spread of the deadly Ebola virus disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The APD officials proposed a &quot;Strategy for Rapid Tracing and Tracking of Individuals,&quot; similar to that used during civil war for the distribution of relief materials to various communities by the Special Emergency Life Food Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a way forward, the APD recommended that the Chair of the National Task Force mandates the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOH&amp;SW) to consider the integration of community enumeration and structure numbering strategy into the Ebola virus transmission tracking and tracing mechanism to enhance and support ongoing efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also offered to provide technical details of the strategy to the MOH&amp;SW and donor partners with whom they can together identify and mobilize national experience and expertise. &quot;We also request that the MOH&amp;SW, in collaboration with all relevant actors, ensures the integration and implementation of the strategy into on-going Ebola control efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding, President Sirleaf commended the APD for the national thoughtfulness and stressed that all hands were required on deck in the effort to contain the further spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also informed the APD officials about the current structural arrangement of the National Task Force, the different interventions undertaken and on-going to stop the spread of the disease. &quot;The Task Force chaired by me with partner organizations as well as all local and international stakeholders with membership is National Consultative Body, while the actual activities involved with fighting the disease is headed by the Incidence Management System led by the MOH&amp;SW with Assistant Minister of Health for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah as Coordinator,&quot; President Sirleaf said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that the Incidence Management System is supported by a Task Force Secretariat headed by Mr. Dorbor Jallah who handles the logistical component and resources involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that as a way of decentralizing the structure, similar structures will be set up at the county level for consistency, collaboration and efficiency. She welcomed the proposal of the APD and promise to advance it to Task Force and Incidence Management System for consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ebola outbreak in West Africa is beginning to take a toll on international business with London-based insurers facing claims for cancelled travel and events.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurers say they are receiving claims relating to the outbreak and, while payouts are rare because policies routinely exclude epidemics, claims are beginning to underline a reluctance to do business even in parts of Africa unaffected by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amanda Lewis, an underwriter at insurer Aegis, said:  The outbreak has caused some isolated event cancellations. Losses are being reported into the London market and I would expect that to gain some momentum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak has been focused on Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, but it is thought it has affected attendance at conferences in South Africa, thousands of miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People s perception is that it is the whole of Africa. The detail gets lost in the hysteria,  said Lewis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurers started to exclude disease outbreaks in standard contracts following the SARS epidemic in 2002-3. Even when disease is covered, insurance contracts do not generally cover losses caused by the fear of a disease rather than the disease itself, Lewis added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the disease has hit four other West African nations and killed more than 1,500 people in the worst epidemic since it emerged in 1976.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traveller, a university student from Guinea, sought treatment at a hospital in Senegal's capital, Dakar, but gave staff no warning that he might have ebola. The next day, a surveillance team in Guinea alerted Senegalese authorities that they had lost track of a person who had come into contact with sick people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said he had disappeared three weeks previously and could have travelled to Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was tracked that day and immediately quarantined after a test confirmed he had ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current outbreak began last year in Guinea and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 3,000 people have contracted the disease, which is spread by bodily fluids and for which there is no licensed treatment or vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate ebola outbreak was reported this week in Congo, where 13 people have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal is a tourist destination whose capital is a major regional transportation hub. The disease's presence there underscores that the situation is out of control despite the efforts of the World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders and other groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO said yesterday that the past week has seen the highest rise in cases to date of more than 500. It warned that the disease could eventually infect 20,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, hopes of a breakthrough have been raised by the successful treatment of infected monkeys with the experimental drug ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 18 rhesus macaques in a study made a complete recovery despite showing severe symptoms of ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, US researchers have found that the virus mutates rapidly, making it far harder to diagnose and treat, even with vaccinations. They found 400 genetic mutations in just 78 patients from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The experimental drug ZMapp is being used to treat infected patients, including William Pooley, the British nurse being cared for at the Royal Free Hospital in London after contracting the disease in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But health experts were unsure how effective the treatment was because no trials on humans have yet been conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a study has now found that 18 rhesus monkeys infected with the disease made a complete recovery after being given ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three animals that were untreated became seriously ill and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts said the results were &quot;extremely encouraging&quot; and &quot;better than expected&quot;, while the scientist who discovered Ebola in 1976 called for clinical trials to begin. &quot;This well-designed trial in non-human primates provides the most convincing evidence to date that ZMapp may be an effective treatment of Ebola infection in humans,&quot; said Prof Peter Piot, from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is now critical that human trials start as soon as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZMapp is a blend of three laboratorymade antibodies that neutralise the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two US doctors infected in Liberia recovered after taking the drug. But it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or whether they were just lucky. About 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least two patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new research was published on the website of the journal Nature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal became the fifth country to be affected by the world's worst Ebola outbreak yesterday, with the epidemic bringing riots in neighbouring Guinea and warnings that preparations for the African Nations football cup will be restricted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senegal's health minister, Awa Marie Coll-Seck, said the country's first case was a Guinean student who went for treatment to a hospital in Dakar on Tuesday, concealing the fact that he had had close contact with victims in his home country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Guinea had been searching for the young man for three weeks after he evaded surveillance, the minister said. At least 1,550 people have died of Ebola and more than 3,000 have been infected since the virus was detected in Guinea in March, quickly spreading over the border to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Cases have been detected in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coll-Seck said the student's itinerary was being traced, and anyone he had been in contact with. Senegal last week banned flights to and from three of the affected countries and shut its land border with Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation warned that 20,000 people could be infected before the outbreak ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Football authorities have ordered Sierra Leone and Guinea to play their African Nations Cup qualifying games on neutral territory, amid fears that large gatherings will help spread the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone is due to play Ivory Coast on 6 September. &quot;The entire Sierra Leone squad will be made up of professional players from overseas so they would not require any Ebola clearance,&quot; said Chris Kamara, secretary general of the Sierra Leone Football Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many African governments have sought a shield around Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the worst-hit countries. In the Guinean city of Nzerekore, riots broke out on Thursday night over rumours that health workers had infected people with the Ebola virus, a Red Cross official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO yesterday reported the highest weekly increase in cases since the epidemic began. The organisation has classified the Ebola outbreak as an international health emergency and on Thursday unveiled a $490m (&pound;295m) plan to bring the outbreak under control over the next nine months, saying it was a global health issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITONS are to be the first to test a new vaccine against the deadly ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty healthy volunteers will be given the vaccine next month in a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the vaccine performs as well in humans as in monkeys, the trial will be extended to 80 people in West Africa. The entire trial programme is being fast-tracked with the intention of using the vaccine on those at high risk early next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,550 people have died from the virus, with more than 3,000 confirmed cases - mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the worst epidemic since the disease was identified 38 years ago and the World Health Organisation predicts the outbreak will last for many months, affecting at least 20,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present there is no vaccine and no proven treatment. The new vaccine contains a single ebola virus protein from the strain sweeping West Africa - anyone inoculated cannot develop the disease itself. It is different from the experimental medicine ZMapp being used to treat William Pooley, 29, the first Briton to contract the virus while working as a nurse in Sierra Leone. He is in isolation at London's Royal Free Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial will be led by Professor Adrian Hill, of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic events unfolding in Africa demand an urgent response,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccine is being co-developed by the US National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline, along with a dual vaccine containing West Africa and Sudan strains of ebola being trialled in the US. The UK initiative is backed by &pound;2.8million from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the UK Department for International Development.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE number of Ebola victims in West Africa may be four times higher than reported and could exceed 20,000 before the disease is brought under control, the World Health Organisation has admitted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures published by the UN health agency yesterday suggested that 3,069 people have been infected by the virus and 1,552 people have died in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO warned that the victims could number 12,000, and announced a road map for dealing with the outbreak that planned for 20,000, and would cost an extra &pound;300 million over nine months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Bruce Aylward, the WHO's assistant director-general for emergency operations, said the current crisis &quot;far outstrips&quot; any historic Ebola outbreak, and complained that airline restrictions on flying in and out of West Africa were hampering the emergency effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Pooley, the British nurse who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone, is continuing to be treated with the experimental drug ZMapp in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteers at Oxford University will be given an experimental vaccine against Ebola in emergency clinical trials to begin in September, it has been announced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britons are being advised against all but essential travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia because of the Ebola outbreak in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office said that because of the narrowing commercial options for flights and the impact on medical facilities, it advises against all but essential travel there, except for those involved in the direct response to the outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British nationals in those countries were advised to stay in contact with their employer or host organisation about the support that they could provide for them while they were in the country or should they wish to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline is to test an experimental Ebola vaccine on people in the UK, US, Gambia and Mali in the next few weeks in a race to contain the deadly virus that has claimed more than 1,500 lives in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned the Ebola epidemic could eventually exceed 20,000 cases. Bruce Aylward, WHO's assistant director-general for emergency operations, said: &quot;This far outstrips any historic Ebola outbreak in numbers. The largest outbreak in the past was about 400 cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human trials of GSK's experimental vaccine - which Britain's largest pharmaceutical company is developing with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) - are to be fast-tracked, with funding from an international consortium. Vaccines normally take 10 years to develop, but GSK said it hopes to finish the first phase of trials by the end of the year. It will start making up to 10,000 doses of the vaccine at the same time as the initial clinical trials so that if they prove successful stocks could be made available immediately to the WHO to vaccinate people in high-risk communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the vaccine would be given to three healthy human volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that earlier trials in chimpanzees had been successful and the method being used could not cause a healthy individual to become infected with the virus. But he added: &quot;We want to take extra special care that we go slowly with the dosing . . . I have been fooled enough in my many years of experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak has killed 1,552 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, with 3,069 recorded cases, according to the latest figures from the WHO, which has declared the epidemic an international health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If regulatory approvals are granted, UK research teams could start vaccinating healthy volunteers from mid-September. In the US the NIH could start phase 1 trials as soon as next week after receiving the green light from the US health regulator, the Food and Drug Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1,552</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">581 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization says the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa could infect more than 20,000 people before it is brought under control. The UN agency said the number of cases could already be four times higher than the 3,000 currently registered; indicating that the ban on flights to and from affected countries will not stop the virus spreading, but will impair efforts to fight it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also called on airlines to resume &quot;vital&quot; flights across the region, saying travel bans were threatening efforts to beat the epidemic. So far, 1,552 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria have died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing a WHO action plan to deal with the outbreak, Bruce Aylward said &quot;the actual number of cases may be 2-4 fold higher than that currently reported&quot; in some areas. The WHO assistant director-general said the possibility of 20,000 cases &quot;is a scale that I think has not ever been anticipated in terms of an Ebola outbreak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not saying we expect 20,000 ... but we have got to have a system in place that we can deal with robust numbers,&quot; he added. The WHO plan calls for $489 million (&pound;295m) to be spent over the next nine months and requires 750 international workers and 12,000 national workers across West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization says the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa could infect more than 20,000 people before it is brought under control. The UN agency said the number of cases could already be four times higher than the 3,000 currently registered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Nigeria confirmed its first Ebola death outside Lagos, with an infected doctor in the oil hub of Port Harcourt dying from the disease. Operations have not yet been affected in Africa's biggest oil producer, but a spokesman for Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, said they were &quot;monitoring the Ebola outbreak very closely&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Ministers from across West Africa are meeting in Ghana at an extraordinary meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to discuss how to prevent the virus from spreading further. Officials at the ECOWAS session backed the WHO's call for flight bans to be ended and called for states to reopen their borders to make it easier for health workers to access the affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Mr. Aylward insisted bans on travel and trade would not stop the spread of Ebola, saying they were &quot;more likely to compromise the ability to respond&quot;. Despite rumors to the contrary, the virus is not airborne and is spread by humans coming into contact with bodily fluids, such as sweat and blood, from those infected with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC West Africa correspondent Thomas Fessy says medical agencies are struggling to cope with an increasing number of cases and growing hostility from communities in certain affected areas. Efforts to prevent the virus spreading are unlikely to see any results given that most treatment centers are already operating at full capacity, our correspondent adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the British medical charity Welcome Trust and pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) said safety trials on an experimental Ebola vaccine are being fast-tracked. GSK says it plans to build up a stockpile of up to 10,000 doses for emergency deployment if results from the trials, which could begin as soon as next month, are good.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have renewed their commitment to working with Liberia in its fight against the ravaging Ebola virus disease now plaguing the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, speaking separately at a joint press conference in the Foyer of the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, August 27, 2014, WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Louis Gomes Sambo and AfDB President, Donald Kaberuka said their visit to Liberia was a demonstration of their loyalty to the Government and people of Liberia in their effort to eradicate the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a demonstration of its support, the AfDB President Donald Kabaruka said his organization was providing a US$60 million grant to countries most affected by the epidemic as its financial intervention to the fight against Ebola virus disease which he believes if not curtailed would have a further negative impact on their economies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most affected countries are Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and of recent Nigeria. The WHO will manage the funds. The grant, according to AfDB President is intended to finance case management, treatment and capacity building of local staff in disease surveillance, contact tracing, among others in the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working closely with the Government of Liberia to ensure that Ebola is eliminated because there is an economic impact after the virus had been eliminated,&quot; Dr. Kaberuka noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the AfDB is seriously working with the Liberian Government in maintaining a stable economy which will include job creation, safe investment and settling the balance of payment situation currently faced by Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the WHO, Mr. Sambo renewed his organization's earlier call that the situation in the region was a global health emergency and encouraged the international community to act as such in curtailing the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He frowned at the cancellation of flights by airline companies which he said was seriously compromising the deployment of experts and logistics in the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current outbreak is mainly a public health problem that is already negatively impacting other aspects of social life and the economic performance of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should do our best together to defeat this epidemic as soon as possible,&quot; Dr. Sambo stressed. Dr. Sambo joined the AfDB President to call on concerned airlines to reconsider their decision as their action could just worsen the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are concerned about the travel ban on the affected countries and we would like to reiterate the WHO position that we don't endorse these bans as they compromise the management and other technological resources that are required to fight the epidemic and address the other public health problem in these countries,&quot; Dr. Sambo further said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf expressed gratitude to the two organizations for the level of solidarity demonstrated in Liberia since the outbreak of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This particular visit is as an extraordinary demonstration of support for Liberia and an expression of confidence in the future of our country,&quot; the Liberian leader told a well attended press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf used the platform to appreciate African countries that have either intervened financially or through the lifting of travel and trade sanctions on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She specifically named the Presidents of C&ocirc;te D'Ivoire for lifting the shipping ban, Senegal for allowing SN Brussels to stopover from Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo for deploying Ebola experts to Liberia and Nigeria for its US$500,000 donated to the Liberian Government to help with the fight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second term of every political administration in most democracies often proves unkind, if not nightmarish, for the leader. Not only does the popularity rating of the leader plummets woefully, public critiques and antagonisms have soared to scathing proportions and former allies and even staunched supporters surprisingly publicly also step out to air their disappointments and frustrations about the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last few years of the second term of President Sirleaf, she has been getting her fair share of this political phenomenon. But it seems the Liberian experience is getting off the mark and members of the First Family are unease and edgy, unable to hold back patience against the irking verbal furies from the public. This is particularly the case with the eldest son of the President, James Sirleaf, who appears, apparently extremely angry as the tone of this statement to the media, a copy obtained by The Analyst, portrays.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition criticisms and public outrage at what is regarded by some pundits as &quot;unpardonable failures&quot; of President Sirleaf has increased in recent months. These criticisms are given teeth and substance by repeated revelations of national budget shortfalls, a persistent rise in prices of essential goods, unprecedented foreign exchange regime with the Liberian dollars in the disadvantageous, coupled with Government's unkempt response to the deadly Ebola virus, amongst others. Amid the rising opposition censures also come calling for the President's resignation, though other members of the public think it would not be the sensible democratic trajectory of the post-conflict nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incessant censures are getting on the nerves of others, particularly family members of President Sirleaf, who believe, in the words of one, critics of the President are blinded by extremist opposition mentality to see how far she has catapulted into a failed state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement release yesterday, the President's first son, James E. Sirleaf said of critics: &quot;The Flagship actors and failed politicians are now carrying a banner supposedly under the mantle of an incorruptible dedicated opposition. They are at it again, bent on undermining constituted and elected Government and the common good of the citizens of the Republic of Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Sirleaf, Liberia has obtained literally billions of good investment monies from decent corporate and private capital firms because of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's election as President of Liberia, adding, &quot;Investors have implicit faith and trust in her leadership. The international community continues to come to her aid wholeheartedly in famine and in health.&quot; &quot;Woe to you for the same will definitely not be true in other leaders who simply just lack international creditworthiness and global appeal,&quot; the President's son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These buffoons now want to link the President to a scandal involving only a few hundred thousand dollars allegedly benefitting her immediate family members.&quot; Mr. Sirleaf, General Manager of the Monrovia Oil Trading Corporation said, &quot;I personally reject this innuendo and stand ready to protect myself and our family members.&quot; If President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had lost the 2011 election, he said, &quot;then let it be said that some of us would still stand firm in our beliefs and faith in her leadership qualities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I for instance am the first born son of the President. I work in private enterprise and still make a decent, independent living,&quot; he boasted, and added: &quot;For all this President has done to try to lift up the Liberian people and the Liberian nation, I am very proud that I can work in business and still have full devotion to make a difference for the country even though I get no personal benefits.&quot; Mr. Sirleaf, who is a private businessman, further said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My daughter is 23 years old. She is currently doing a Masters of Law (LLM) at Duke University, which is in the top ten Law Schools in USA. I am privately underwriting her education charges. &quot;Are the President's children included in remuneration in the annual budget?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No! Do they get per diem, or allocations as Senators and members of the House of Representatives? No! And what about the past history? What do you perceive will be the case for future governments after the Sirleaf administration steps down in 2017/2018?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask yourself this question and take it very seriously. What happens to Liberia then? What about the past governments over the last 25 years? What about education, growth, skills and training obtained by the youth and the responsiveness of those governments to their personal development needs? Ask yourselves what has changed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talk is cheap!&quot; he asserted further. &quot;Did you ever visit JFK in the 1980s and 1990s? Yes, I know and you should be persuaded that much has changed!&quot; Mr. Sirleaf expressed the hope that &quot;We are determined to see this nation through the Ebola health, cancer and with perseverance, it will happen in spite of the many detractors that try to sabotage the Government operations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that decent people and the silent majority in the country are in full support of our elected government and the security apparatus will not stand for any disruptions or attempts to discredit them and jeopardize the state of affairs, the general health of the majority of the citizens of this country, the rule of law and peace governance in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Flagship actors and failed politicians are now carrying a banner supposedly under the mantle of an incorruptible dedicated opposition. They are at it again, bent on undermining constituted and elected Government and the common good of the citizens of the Republic of Liberia. Liberia has obtained literally billions of good investment monies from decent corporate and private capital firms because of Ellen Sirleaf's election as President of Liberia. Investors have implicit faith and trust placed in her leadership. The international community continues to come to her aid wholeheartedly in famine and in health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woe to you for the same will definitely not be true in other leaders; who simply just lack international creditworthiness and global appeal. These buffoons now want to link the President to a scandal involving only a few hundred thousand dollars allegedly benefitting her immediate family members. I personally reject this innuendo and stand ready to protect myself and our family members. If this President had lost the 2011 election, then let it be said that some of us would still stand firm in our beliefs and faith in her leadership qualities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MERGER mania in the healthcare sector has kept dealers on their toes during the peak holiday weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash-rich pharmaceutical majors are forever looking to acquire their smaller, more nimble counterparts, and are prepared to pay stonking premium prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend, Californian-based InterMune was swallowed by Swiss drugs giant Roche for an eye-watering $8.3bn. The market now hears rumours that at least four international drug groups are stalking a company that is developing an experimental treatment for the deadly ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals rose 3.24pc to $19.75 following a sharp increase last week on news that it has verbal approval from the US Food &amp; Drug Administration that would fast-track its new drug to treat the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action may allow the medicine to be used to treat the growing tally of those stricken by the virus. TKM-Ebola is being developed by Tekmira and the US Department of Defence medical team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tekmira is capitalised at a measly &pound;400m and would cost a bidder in the region of &pound;1bn-plus, a relatively small mouthful for any cash-rich giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumours suggest two of the interested parties could be the UK's Shire (22p off at 4894p) and GlaxoSmithKline (15.5p dearer at 1463p. The mega premium paid for InterMune puts a valuation of $40 plus a-share on Tekmira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of ebola in Africa has killed more than 1,000 people since February and is the worst since the disease was discovered in the mid-1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrappy small selling became contagious as the day wore on but the Footsie rallied late to close 7.9 points higher at 6,830.66. Wall Street retrieved an initial 14 points fall to close 15.31 points higher at 17,122.01, putting the record 17,138.27 level well within its sights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrisons, which has been one of the worst Footsie performers this year, down more than 30pc, rallied 2.6p to 184.4p on Kantar market research data showing its sales in the 12 weeks to August 17 were better than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesco, on the other hand, shed 2.8p to 249.3p following data showing its sales decline had worsened, falling 4pc with its market share dipping to 28.8pc from 30.2pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New boss Dave Lewis will have his work cut out to reverse the trend when he takes over from Phil Clarke in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Utilities lost 11.52p to 896.5p on a RBC Capital Markets downgrade to sector perform. Any positives are priced-in, says the broker. Oil services group Petrofac rose 26p to 1149p after maintaining its full-year earnings guidance despite a 44pc fall in interim profits to &pound;82m. The order book hit a record &pound;12.2bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excellent interim results helped high quality ceramic tableware maker Churchill China serve up a gain of 17.5p at 460p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales rose to a record &pound;16.8m in the six months to June as its hospitality business, which supplies crockery to restaurants, pubs and conference venues, traded above expectations due to the buoyant trend of people eating out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cantor Fitzgerald has advised clients to load up with motor components giant GKN, 2.8p easier at 356.8p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broker points out that the President of Anfavea, the Brazilian National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, has indicated that the pace of new car sales has recovered since the very depressed levels in June arising from the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second half Brazilian sales are likely to be up 14pc. A stabilised Brazil suggests that global auto production will beat general expectations. Its target price is 430p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punters were itching to get hold of Tyratech, 0.62p up at 8p, on hearing that it will be providing Sainsbury and Tesco with its Vamousse head lice products. Superdrug and Boots have already been signed up and first products will appear in UK stores in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, Vamousse is stocked in more than 4,000 Walmart stores and is available through online retailers Walmart.com, Amazon.com, drugstore.com and Walgreens.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitise advanced 5.5p to 47.75p after strengthening its tie-up with IBM Corporation. Its mobile banking and payment technology will be enabled, hosted and sold via IBM cloud-delivered solutions, bringing it closer to its target of 200m users using its mobile money products and services by 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AfriAg's agri-marketing division AfriAg Marketing has sold its first refrigerated 40ft sea container, containing a gross weight of about 20 metric tons of South African-sourced frozen fish products, to clients in China. The news lifted the stock 25pc to 0.68p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specialist engineering group James Fisher added 15p at 1400p following another strong set of interim results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY sees an interesting new arrival on the standard listings market. Shares of General Industries will start trading at 10p and should achieve a small premium. The cash shell raised &pound;1m and is believed to be looking for a reverse takeover in the services sector. Its management has a good track record and its backers include the well-respected Richard Wallenberg, who has had several IPO successes over the years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRANCE has recommended its citizens leave Sierra Leone and Liberia following the ebola outbreak, while Air France has temporarily suspended flights to Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French national carrier is halting three flights a week to the capital Freetown at the request of the French government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air France will maintain daily flights to Conakry in Guinea and Lagos, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to ebola, which has already killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa since March, a spokesman for the airline said: Measures in place at airports there guarantee... that no passengers presenting symptoms... can board.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris said the increasing spread of ebola - notably in Liberia and Sierra Leone - had prompted the request for suspension of the flights and a recommendation that French citizens leave Sierra Leone and Liberia. Many regional and major airlines have suspended services to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries most affected by the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the United Nations has said the lack of flights to the affected area is making it increasingly difficult to bring in much-needed supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN flights bringing humanitarian workers to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have also faced restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his neighbours began falling ill with Ebola, Sheikh Kallon felt fortunate that he was well enough to continue tending his farm deep in the forested interior of Sierra Leone. Then, one of his drinking buddies died of the disease, and Kallon's entire family was quarantined for 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked my workers to keep going to the farm, but they said they don't want to touch money from my hands in case they get Ebola,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his crops rotting in the fields, Kallon now spends his days sitting with his family on their porch surrounded by soldiers enforcing the quarantine. The soldiers hardly need bother: lifelong neighbours are too terrified to approach, and a few miles away an entire community that has been unable to trade altogether has run out of salt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural farmers like Kallon - whose rice, cocoa and cassava fields account for nearly half Sierra Leone's gross domestic production - are among the hardest-hit in the economic fallout of the world's biggest Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repercussions have radiated from these far-flung villages to the country's financial markets, prompting cutbacks by multinational firms whose revenues had previously spurred double-digit growth and allowed Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea to painstakingly rebuild their war-shattered economies over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three-quarters of Sierra Leone's 20% economic growth last year was fuelled by the mining industry. Foreign companies such as London Mining, in which the commodities giant Glencore has an offtake agreement, had planned to treble yields in a decade. But London Mining's shares plunged by 19% after the company reduced forecasts in part because of the Ebola crisis this year. The British firm has now moved some workers from Sierra Leone. Commercial banks have slashed working hours to minimise contact with clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme is scaling up its operations to provide food to about one million people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone at a cost of $70m (&pound;42m). Sierra Leone has asked it to &quot;consider significantly upscaling supplies, even for non-quarantined communities,&quot; according to a UN source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact has spread thousands of miles to African countries that have never recorded an Ebola death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment summits have been cancelled as far afield as Namibia, almost 3,000 miles from the heart of the epidemic, and west African athletes were banned from competing in some Youth Olympics events this month. Korean Air Lines scrapped flights to Kenya, a regional hub that has not recorded any Ebola cases in this outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beyond a health crisis, we're looking at a whole range of knock-on effects,&quot; said David McLachlan-Karr, UN country coordinator for Sierra Leone. &quot;The single biggest concern is the longer term impact on development aspirations, which is premised on high foreign investment and high earnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in all three countries have trimmed growth forecasts as money is diverted into tackling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the quarantine, Kallon had difficulties. A state of emergency meant more than two dozen checkpoints sprang up between Kailahun in the east and Freetown, eight hours' drive away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With fewer farmers travelling, the cost of farm produce doubled in a matter of weeks, said Umaru Barry, a sharply dressed trader selling smartphones in the capital's hilly streets. Barry's own trade was suffering. &quot;We sell expensive phones and mainly foreigners would buy them, but now they've all left the country,&quot; he said of the phones that retail at around $700 (&pound;422).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest sign of the deepening financial chill is the silence of Freetown's black market &quot;dollar boys&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country where banks are unable to meet demand for hard currency, their piercing cries of &quot;Pounds! Dollars! Euros!&quot; have long drawn everyone from petty traders to multinationals, and are a reliable gauge of financial health. &quot;There's no business any more,&quot; said John Moriba, a dollar boy sitting glumly beside a bucket of chlorinated water in which he regularly dips his hands to kill the Ebola virus. &quot;Normally I have a lot of people calling, but today it's 3pm and nobody has come yet. Before Ebola, that was never possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moriba is less worried about Ebola itself than the negative perceptions. &quot;We heard that even if you have Ebola you can sit next to somebody, just don't touch. So I don't know what all this trouble is about,&quot; he said. Although the virus kills with gruesome speed, Ebola can only be passed on if bodily fluid from affected patients enters mucous membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telltale signs of a slowdown litter the capital. Freetown's only sushi restaurant now sells chicken sandwiches, as its Chinese fish suppliers have shut up shop. In one popular hotel, where 34 bedrooms overlook a stunning stretch of bay, only eight rooms were filled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, British Airways and Kenya Airways suspended flights to both Sierra Leone and Liberia. Yesterday, Air France suspended its flights to Sierra Leone on the advice of the French government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to work hard to ensure that the economy doesn't suffer irreparable damage,&quot; said the UN's McLachlan-Karr. &quot;It's not helpful for companies to shut down operations . . . when in fact appropriate measures can be put in place to ensure it doesn't spread. That reinforces not only isolation but also the perception of the country being in crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third leading Ebola doctor has died in Sierra Leone, a government official in the west African nation confirmed yesterday. The news came as another scientist, who also contracted the disease there, began treatment in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers are trying to work out how the scientist, whose identity and condition are being withheld for privacy reasons, contracted Ebola before his overnight evacuation to a Hamburg hospital, it has been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international surge of health workers is extremely important and if something happens - if health workers get infected and it scares off other international health workers from coming - we will be in dire straits,&quot; said World Health Organisation spokesman Christy Feig.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO said the stricken scientist was from Senegal and was infected while working for the agency as a consultant. Dr Stefan Schmiedel, who is helping oversee his treatment at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, said the clinic would not be using experimental medicine, instead concentrating on &quot;supportive care&quot; such as fever reduction and fluid management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In west Africa the patients die relatively quickly of the illness, or survive and then return to health,&quot; he said. &quot;How that will go under our medical supervision, we can't yet estimate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest doctor to die from the virus was named as Dr Sahr Rogers. He was working at a hospital in the eastern town of Kenema when he contracted Ebola, according to Sierra Leonean presidential adviser Ibrahim Ben Kargbo. His death raises fresh concerns over the country's ability to fight Ebola, which has killed more than 1,400 people across west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the WHO said it was pulling out its team from the eastern Sierra Leonean city of Kailahun. According to the AP, the agency's representative said the team was exhausted and the added stress caused by one of their colleagues contracting Ebola risked increasing the chances of mistakes being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada also announced it was evacuating a three-member mobile laboratory team from Sierra Leone after people in their hotel were diagnosed with Ebola. Care workers are at increased risk of contracting the disease due to their proximity to patients. To date, the WHO has reported more than 240 of them developing Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. More than half of that number have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, human rights campaigners have demand an investigation into the death of a teenager they said was shot by soldiers during a riot at a Monrovia slum that had been quarantined in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. According to Agence France-Presse, 16-year-old Siafa Kamara was one of four residents of the West Point slum wounded during violent clashes last week. His family announced on Sunday that he had died in hospital after sustaining bullet wounds, although the government has denied he was shot, saying he injured his legs on barbed wire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a need to set up an independent body to investigate the death of the boy. You cannot fight Ebola with the army,&quot; Gladys Johnson, head of the country's independent national commission on human rights, said on Liberian radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Wales, a doctor who was quarantined for three weeks after helping Ebola patients in Africa has returned to work, it was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specialist registrar Nathalie MacDermott, who works at the neonatal unit in Singleton hospital in Swansea, flew to Liberia with Christian organisation Samaritan's Purse to help victims of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinical safety trials begin in US next week, after approval from the FDA; volunteer testing in UK and Africa from September</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GlaxoSmithKline's experimental Ebola vaccine could be tested on humans in the UK, US, the Gambia and Mali in the next few weeks, in an effort to contain the deadly virus that has claimed more than 1,500 lives in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human trials of the experimental vaccine - which Britain's largest pharmaceutical company is developing with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) - are to be fast-tracked, with funding from an international consortium. Vaccines normally take 10 years to develop, but GSK said it hopes to finish the first phase of trials by the end of 2014. It will start making up to 10,000 doses of the vaccine at the same time as the initial clinical trials, so that - if they prove successful - stocks could be made available immediately to the World Health Organisation (WHO) to vaccinate people in high-risk communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If regulatory approvals are granted, the UK research teams could start vaccinating healthy volunteers from mid-September. In the US, the NIH could start phase I trials as soon as next week - the first test on humans to assess safety and efficacy - after receiving the green light from the US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine has already shown promising results in primates exposed to Ebola, without significant adverse effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's biggest Ebola outbreak in seven years has killed 1,552 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, out of 3,069 cases, according to the WHO, which has declared the epidemic an international health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A [#xfffd]2.8m grant from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Department for International Development will fund safety tests by a team led by professor Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford. If successful, the trial will be extended to volunteers at the MRC unit in the Gambia, and to Bamako, Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oxford study will involve 60 healthy volunteers, while those in the Gambia and Mali will each involve 40. Each set of volunteers will be split into groups of 20 who will receive different doses of the vaccine, which is a chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine into which two Ebola genes have been inserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hill said: &quot;The tragic events unfolding in Africa demand an urgent response. In recent years, similar investigational vaccines have safely immunised infants and adults against a range of diseases including malaria, HIV and Hepatitis[#xfffd]C. We, and all our partners on this project, are optimistic that this candidate vaccine may prove useful against Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experimental vaccine is against the Zaire species of Ebola, which is the one circulating in west Africa and for which there is no cure; it uses a single Ebola virus protein to generate an immune response. It does not contain infectious virus material. GSK acquired it when it bought the Swiss biotech firm Okairos last May for (EURO)250m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US NIAID - part of the National Institutes of Health - is also supporting work on other early-stage Ebola vaccines, including one from Johnson &amp; Johnson's Crucell division that is expected to enter early clinical studies around the turn of the year.The NIH director, Francis Collins, is due to speak today about the agency's work on Ebola vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NewLink Genetics, based in Iowa, is also working on an Ebola vaccine and has just struck a deal with another firm to manufacture the product and increase its supply, before starting preclinical trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experimental Ebola treatments include ZMapp, made by San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical. The drug has been given to Will Pooley, the British nurse who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and has been flown back to London.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN health agency say outbreak is accelerating in the region while the death toll has now exceeded 1,500</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned the number of Ebola cases could rise to 20,000 as doctors in Liberia say the deadly virus is now spreading so rapidly they can no longer deal with the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN health agency said the outbreak is accelerating in west Africa, where the death toll has now reached 1,552, and it believes the numbers who have been hit by Ebola could be two to four times higher than the current 3,069 cases currently reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[It] is a scale that I think has not ever been anticipated in terms of an Ebola outbreak,&quot; said Bruce Aylward, assistant director general of WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the increase came from cities including the Liberian capital Monrovia, where a slum was quarantined last week, leading to foot shortages and civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really just some urban areas that have outstripped the reporting capacity,&quot; he said. Up to now most efforts have concentrated on rural areas close to the Guinea border. His remarks come as Medecins sans Frontieres said it was struggling to cope with the caseload in Monrovia. MSF has just opened a new Ebola hospital in the Liberian capital and after one week it's already at capacity of 120 patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of patients we are treating is unlike anything we've seen in previous outbreaks,&quot; said Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia. &quot;This is not an Ebola outbreak, it is a humanitarian emergency and it needs a full-scale humanitarian response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak started in Guinea in March and is the 26th since 1976 when the virus was first identified, but is widely recognised to be out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is simply unacceptable that, five months after the declaration of this outbreak, serious discussions are only now starting about international leadership and co-ordination,&quot; said MSF director of operations Brice de la Vigne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF said the number of people seeking care at its new Monrovia centre is &quot;growing faster than we can handle both in terms of the number of beds and the capacity of the staff&quot;. It said patients are coming from nearly every district of the city and healthcare workers were &quot;struggling to screen new arrivals, care for admitted patients, safely remove dead bodies and transport them to the crematorium&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it is so overwhelmed it can no longer administer intravenous treatments. MSF has five field hospitals in west Africa, plugging a gap left by the fragile health care systems. It says most of the medical facilities in Monrovia have shut down over fears of the virus among staff, leaving many people with no healthcare at all. This is leading to fears of a secondary health crisis with expectant mothers and malaria patients now going untreated too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Dannatt is founder of British charity Street Child, which has 650 volunteers in two of the worst stricken countries Sierra Leone and Liberia. He says the catastrophic spread was not to do with the strength of the virus but the lack of &quot;anti-Ebola measures&quot; being put in place. He also said a food aid programme to help feed those in quarantined areas in eastern Sierra Leone is completely inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are providing food for a standard World Food Programme five heads per household. But in Sierra Leone there are 12 to 15 people living in the majority of households,&quot; said Dannatt. He is offering to lend Street Child's workers to government task forces to help contain the disease and is launching an emergency appeal later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the Guardian that containment could be achieved by &quot;low tech public protection measures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we have here is porous borders, poverty and big cities. It is the perfect storm. What we need is a massive influx of resources from WHO, from the US, from the UK,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO said it is launching a new $489m (&pound;294m) initiative to try to contain Ebola within six to nine months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aylward said it would require the assistance of 750 international workers and 12,000 national workers. He urged airlines, including British Airways, Air France and Gambia Bird, who have suspended flights to the affected countries to re-open services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try to imagine yourself as a patient at the neglected Kenema hospital in Sierra Leone, desperately afraid, alone and in pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In panic you shout out for help, and then the calm young Englishman arrives at your side, offering water and murmuring soothing words you don't understand but which make you feel cared for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's surely how it must have been when brave William Pooley did his rounds. The British nurse, now struck down by the Ebola virus, must have seemed like an angel to the terrified patients after most of those who should have been nursing them had fled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William had already made the selfless decision to go to the country's capital Freetown to carry out a six-month volunteer placement at a hospice caring for those terminally ill with HIV, cancer and tuberculosis. That's the kind of person he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he heard of the place where need was even greater the hospital with minimum standards of hygiene and care, where people afflicted by the dreaded virus were dying horrible deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though warned against such an act of selfless heroism, William put his own life in jeopardy to work horrendous hours and try to save others. He didn't heed any health'*'safety' considerations or consult his insurance policy, he just acted because he had dedicated his life to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow Briton Dr Oliver Johnson, who worked with him in Sierra Leone, describes William as a pretty extraordinary guy': From the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and I spoke about the risk and I think he absolutely understood. He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who could forget seeing a filmed interview with William, in which he expressed his happiness at seeing patients recover? He looked tired, but upbeat and smiling not knowing he was about to contract Ebola. But I doubt he would have done anything differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately but predictably there's a chorus of criticism polluting the internet: poisonous voices calling William Pooley a fool, spouting the old clich&eacute; that charity begins at home, and criticising our Government's wonderfully quick decision to airlift this British citizen efficiently to a London hospital where, despite our gripes about the NHS, clever people and first-world medical equipment should save him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly, self-interest is behind many of the negative comments, since ignorant people seem terrified that William will cause an Ebola epidemic here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a choice example, posted on the Left-wing Guardian newspaper's website: This guy's life is not so very valuable. It was staggeringly thick to bring him home.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not valuable? Try telling that to Will's parents, Robin and Jackie, and all those who love him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In stark contrast, Mr and Mrs Pooley have asked everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see where their son's generosity of spirit came from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just as well William believes that all human life is valuable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be celebrating that lesson. How, in a world which can seem so wicked and rotten where murderous jihadists and other pitiless fanatics regard human life as cheap one selfless young man calmly risked his life in the most difficult situation imaginable, to help others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, this story reminds us that he is not alone. All over the globe, men and women like him are working for charities such as Voluntary Service Overseas, Christian Aid, Oxfam, the Red Cross, Medecins sans Frontieres and Save The Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are driven by altruism and perhaps to repay some of the blessings of the privileged lives we lead in the West. Many started as teachers, social workers, nurses, engineers or doctors, but felt inspired by the challenge of working for a charity abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That idea of duty used to be the backbone of education, instilled by schools, family and church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During World War I, it led women of all classes to the front line as volunteer nurses. There was a heroism about such self-sacrifice which all recognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a heroism that accepted the overriding moral principle at the root of Christianity and Judaism (as well the charitable impulse at the heart of Islam) that you always try to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, it sometimes feels as if the concept is foreign to most people today until one young man reminds us that altruism is always there, even if we can't see it; a light shining in darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an age when the idea of heroism' is devalued to such an extent that an overpaid footballer is called a hero', we desperately need the William Pooleys of our world to remind us of what the human spirit is capable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask you, what would the world be, bereft of such sacrifice? What effect would it have on our daily lives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may think one man's (perhaps reckless) courage in Sierra Leone has nothing to do with your life, but that's wrong. It has everything to do with what Victorian novelist George Eliot called the growing good of the world'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all adds up a great cumulative wave of strength that benefits us all in the end. It's nothing less than another battle won in the war between good and evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People may sneer about do-gooders', but what do they want? People to do harm? Lord knows, there's enough of that about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But my point is, the day will come when you will want somebody to do good' to you. Then, you will be grateful for the universal kindness that lifts what psychoanalyst Carl Jung called the collective unconscious'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my long journalistic career, I have met plenty of people like William Pooley from the retired British couple volunteering as teachers in a poverty-stricken Ugandan village for two years, to the ex-Army cook working with mentally-handicapped girls outside Bangkok, to the gentle female prison visitor in the West Country who worked with the most violent young men, to the former accountant who gave up his lucrative career to join the Christian organisation Street Pastors, which helps drunken revellers in town centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so many more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley's friends say he is determined to go back to Sierra Leone when his ordeal is over. How uplifting that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pray he will recover and continue his inspiring work. Because somewhere, in a hospital bed, a man, woman or child is lying in pain and needs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody who has similar hopes, fears and loves, as you and me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow Briton Dr Oliver Johnson, who worked with him in Sierra Leone, describes William as a pretty extraordinary guy': From the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and I spoke about the risk and I think he absolutely understood. He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who could forget seeing a filmed interview with William, in which he expressed his happiness at seeing patients recover? He looked tired, but upbeat and smiling not knowing he was about to contract Ebola. But I doubt he would have done anything differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately but predictably there's a chorus of criticism polluting the internet: poisonous voices calling William Pooley a fool, spouting the old clich&eacute; that charity begins at home, and criticising our Government's wonderfully quick decision to airlift this British citizen efficiently to a London hospital where, despite our gripes about the NHS, clever people and first-world medical equipment should save him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly, self-interest is behind many of the negative comments, since ignorant people seem terrified that William will cause an Ebola epidemic here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a choice example, posted on the Left-wing Guardian newspaper's website: This guy's life is not so very valuable. It was staggeringly thick to bring him home.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not valuable? Try telling that to Will's parents, Robin and Jackie, and all those who love him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In stark contrast, Mr and Mrs Pooley have asked everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see where their son's generosity of spirit came from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just as well William believes that all human life is valuable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be celebrating that lesson. How, in a world which can seem so wicked and rotten where murderous jihadists and other pitiless fanatics regard human life as cheap one selfless young man calmly risked his life in the most difficult situation imaginable, to help others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, this story reminds us that he is not alone. All over the globe, men and women like him are working for charities such as Voluntary Service Overseas, Christian Aid, Oxfam, the Red Cross, Medecins sans Frontieres and Save The Children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are driven by altruism and perhaps to repay some of the blessings of the privileged lives we lead in the West. Many started as teachers, social workers, nurses, engineers or doctors, but felt inspired by the challenge of working for a charity abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That idea of duty used to be the backbone of education, instilled by schools, family and church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During World War I, it led women of all classes to the front line as volunteer nurses. There was a heroism about such self-sacrifice which all recognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a heroism that accepted the overriding moral principle at the root of Christianity and Judaism (as well the charitable impulse at the heart of Islam) that you always try to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, it sometimes feels as if the concept is foreign to most people today until one young man reminds us that altruism is always there, even if we can't see it; a light shining in darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an age when the idea of heroism' is devalued to such an extent that an overpaid footballer is called a hero', we desperately need the William Pooleys of our world to remind us of what the human spirit is capable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask you, what would the world be, bereft of such sacrifice? What effect would it have on our daily lives?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may think one man's (perhaps reckless) courage in Sierra Leone has nothing to do with your life, but that's wrong. It has everything to do with what Victorian novelist George Eliot called the growing good of the world'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all adds up a great cumulative wave of strength that benefits us all in the end. It's nothing less than another battle won in the war between good and evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People may sneer about do-gooders', but what do they want? People to do harm? Lord knows, there's enough of that about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But my point is, the day will come when you will want somebody to do good' to you. Then, you will be grateful for the universal kindness that lifts what psychoanalyst Carl Jung called the collective unconscious'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my long journalistic career, I have met plenty of people like William Pooley from the retired British couple volunteering as teachers in a poverty-stricken Ugandan village for two years, to the ex-Army cook working with mentally-handicapped girls outside Bangkok, to the gentle female prison visitor in the West Country who worked with the most violent young men, to the former accountant who gave up his lucrative career to join the Christian organisation Street Pastors, which helps drunken revellers in town centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so many more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley's friends say he is determined to go back to Sierra Leone when his ordeal is over. How uplifting that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pray he will recover and continue his inspiring work. Because somewhere, in a hospital bed, a man, woman or child is lying in pain and needs him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody who has similar hopes, fears and loves, as you and me.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I am thrilled to be alive,&quot; Dr Kent Brantly said, rejoicing at his &quot;miraculous&quot; survival last weekend. The American medical missionary had every reason to be grateful: after treatment with an experimental therapy, he has recovered from the Ebola virus which is killing thousands in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Dr Brantly's heartfelt gratitude has struck some as inappropriate - even cruel. They argue that Uncle Sam, not God, saved the young Oregon physician. He was, one commentator sneered, &quot;whizzed home&quot; by the American authorities, to a hospital in Atlanta, where ZMapp, an antibody serum, was administered. Thousands of Africans were not so lucky. They died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Dr Brantly speaks of his gratitude to the same God that has overseen the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secularist finds this baffling and downright nasty: how can Brantly thank God for saving him, while knowing that men, women and children back in Liberia are dying all around him of the same virus? Surely only a Wasp's arrogance explains Brantly's reaction. He thinks he is one of the chosen few who deserves God's help - in the form of an expensive drug - and damn the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beyond this sneering, though, the unbeliever wrestles with a question that, ever since Job, has bothered the faithful too: how can an all-knowing, all-loving God allow for horrors like Ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brantly has faith. And he would answer that it does not help to understand God's ways, but to accept them. Faith means total surrender to the divine will. The young missionary is giving thanks to God, because he believes He has saved his life; but he would have just as readily died with a &quot;praise be to God&quot; on his lips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This total abnegation of the self requires extraordinary humility and sometimes, as in Dr Brantly's case, extraordinary courage. He displayed both when he left his safe American home and doctor's salary, because &quot;God called us to serve the poor&quot; in Liberia. There, he received his first Ebola patient back in June - &quot;and after her there was a steady increase&quot; in the numbers seeking his help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Brantly was ready to die for his patients and for his faith. He is not alone. Christian missionaries are combating Ebola in west Africa even now, and also teaching in schools, running orphanages, counselling trauma victims. Their dedication has earned them admirers throughout the continent - and beyond: even the arch-atheist Richard Dawkins was moved to include on his website an article by Matthew Parris (also an atheist) that praised Evangelical missions, and concluded &quot;Africa needs God&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those of us who have encountered them will agree that Christian missionaries such as Dr Brantly deserve praise rather than snide comments. In the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, my family was befriended by an elderly American couple, missionaries who for more than 30 years had travelled across francophone Africa. The Comorians did not face Ebola but palu, a virulent form of malaria. Dr and Mrs Barnet drove their ancient Jeep around the islands and set up makeshift clinics, handing out tablets and, when these failed, words of comfort. My father, then a very casual Catholic, once asked Dr Barnet how his faith survived such tragedy. &quot;My faith,&quot; replied the good doctor, &quot;brought me here, to confront this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Save the Children to the End Fund, plenty of nonfaith organisations are trying to help Africans combat Ebola. Like Kent Brantly, they deserve our support. But I suspect that should one of their doctors or nurses be infected, their survival will not provoke snide commentary. Not that Dr Brantly will let such attacks worry him. Faith does not always guard against illness or death; but it does guard against the meanness of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British Ebola sufferer William Pooley is being given the experimental drug ZMapp and is sitting up, talking and reading in his hospital bed, his doctors have disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley, 29, is being given the drug that was credited with saving the lives of two American missionaries earlier this month and was described yesterday as a &quot;resilient and remarkable young man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It had been thought that supplies of ZMapp had run out, but doctors at the Royal Free Hospital, in London, managed to get hold of some from abroad and Mr Pooley was given the first dose on Monday. Further doses are expected to be given to him &quot;in due course&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The staff looking after him at an isolation unit in the Royal Free had lengthy discussions with Mr Pooley about the possible pitfalls of taking the unlicensed drug before he gave them the go-ahead to prescribe it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Michael Jacobs, consultant and clinical lead in infectious diseases at the hospital, said: &quot;We have had the opportunity to give him the ZMapp treatment that I am sure you are aware of. It is an experimental medicine, we made that absolutely clear in our discussions with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Jacobs added: &quot;What has become apparent to us is that he is clearly a rather resilient and remarkable young man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley's condition was described as &quot;very stable&quot;, and he has been sitting up in bed, talking and reading, and been in good spirits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Jacobs said: &quot;We are giving him the very best care possible. However, the next few days will be crucial. The disease has a variable course and we will know much more in a week's time. Will is in a stable position and we are very pleased with where he is, we couldn't hope for more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no cure for Ebola, but encouraging results with people who have been given ZMapp suggest it is the nearest thing to a cure currently available. The drug has not yet been tested for safety or effectiveness on humans and its manufacturer, California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, only began developing it early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was given to the two US aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, after they were flown to a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, from Liberia. Both have since been discharged from hospital after recovering. But others treated have been less fortunate. A Liberian doctor and a Spanish priest who received the plantderived drug in Africa both died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its website, the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, says: &quot;At this time, very few courses of this experimental treatment have been manufactured. Since the product is still in an experimental stage, it is too early to know whether ZMapp is effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The manufacturer of this experimental treatment continues to research and evaluate the product's safety and effectiveness. It has not yet been tested in humans for safety or effectiveness and much more study is needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sierra Leone, where Mr Pooley was working as a volunteer at a hospital in Kenema when he tested positive for Ebola on Saturday, patients are given little more than paracetamol and water, to stave off fever and dehydration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current outbreak has killed 57 per cent of people who are known to have caught Ebola. Gabriel Madiye, director of a hospice where Mr Pooley had been working before volunteering to treat Ebola patients in Kenema, said: &quot;From my sources I understand he is doing fine and he is receiving good care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He phoned me just after he arrived back in England and said he would call me in another two weeks, when he said he would have recovered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley's family are at the hospital but will only be able to see him through the plastic tent that isolates him from staff and visitors to stop the virus spreading through bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What has become apparent to us is that he is clearly a rather resilient and remarkable young man'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley, the first British person to contract the Ebola virus, has been given an experimental drug as part of his treatment in London, it has been revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley, a 29-year-old nurse from Eyke in Suffolk, was flown back to the UK by the RAF on Sunday after contracting Ebola while volunteering at a treatment centre for people with the deadly virus in Kenema, Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infectious diseases at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, where Pooley is being treated in a specialist unit, said he was doing well, describing him as a &quot;resilient and remarkable young man&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference at the hospital yesterday, Jacobs said: &quot;We had the opportunity to give him the ZMapp treatment. It is an experimental medicine, we made that absolutely clear in our discussions with him.&quot; He said that it was too early to say how Pooley was responding but he had not shown any side-effects from the drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley, who is in a specially designed tent with a controlled ventilation system, has been given his first dose of ZMapp and will be given further doses over the course of the next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Unicef said that it had airlifted 100 tonnes of health and hygiene supplies to Liberia, strengthening national efforts to combat the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no proven cure for Ebola, which has killed more than 1,400 people, but two US aid workers recovered after being treated with ZMapp, raising hopes about its efficacy. However, a Liberian doctor who received the drug died on Sunday and a Spanish missionary priest treated with ZMapp has also died from the virus. Some people have responded to treatment with intravenous fluids and body salts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health had apparently been trying to obtain supplies of ZMapp, but the manufacturer said high demand meant it had no remaining stocks. Jacobs said the team treating the nurse had sourced the drug through its clinical networks with the help of international colleagues. Pooley, who fell ill after five weeks volunteering at the Kenema government hospital, made the ultimate decision to take the drug, expressing enthusiasm at the prospect, said Jacobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Pooley's condition had been stable since he was taken to the hospital under police escort on Sunday and he had been sitting up in bed, reading and chatting to staff. &quot;It's fair to say that we couldn't hope to be in a better place today given where he is with the illness,&quot; he said. Explaining why Pooley had been given the experimental drug when he appeared to be doing well, Jacobs stressed that they wanted to give him the best care possible and that his condition was subject to change. He admitted: &quot;We were rather limited in our knowledge about the medicine but we thought there was sufficient reason to go ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs said the team treating Pooley had been well prepared, having known that it was only a matter of time before they would have a patient with the Ebola virus and that they had treated people with similar infections in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Pooley's prognosis would be clearer in a week's time. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told Sky News: &quot;We are very clear that the risk level from transporting Mr Pooley over to London remains very low. I'm actually really proud of what the NHS has been able to offer to a very, very brave man.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley was working as a nurse at the Kenema Ebola unit, one of Sierra Leone's two main clinics, before he contracted the virus. Jo Dunlop, a freelance journalist, met him several times as she reported on the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a brutal week at Kenema hospital when I met Will six weeks ago. The nursing staff, slowly diminishing in number, were reeling in the wake of the death of Sister Mbalu Fonnie, their respected colleague and friend, who became infected after treating patients on the Ebola ward. Her death came soon after the deaths of seven other nurses who worked on the ward. A few days later, the much-loved Dr Sheik Umar Khan, Sierra Leone's only haemorrhagic fever specialist, would test positive with the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will finished his shift late the night we met. There had been a riot outside the hospital, after which most nurses walked out, leaving Will and Sister Nancy Yoko to hold the crumbling fort. They were exhausted after working 14 hours and at 9pm made the painful decision to leave the 45 Ebola patients unattended as no one had turned up for the night shift. They both needed a break to gather their strength for the next day. Will was rattled by having to leave the patients alone. &quot;We gave them water and paracetamol and then we had to walk out. Patients are dying the most horrible deaths. I'm expecting to find several corpses tomorrow morning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke of the traumatic situations on the ward, accounts that were unadorned and honest, and he explained some of the practical struggles of dealing with so many deaths when you have such limited resources. He described patients dying in front of him and then being unable to find help to move their bodies, which meant leaving bodies lying next to other patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He talked about everyday life at the heart of the Ebola outbreak. Some people were up, walking, recovering, children were playing, sometimes singing. There were even rare moments of laughter. He described women in recovery, saying: &quot;They were sitting around singing songs. You wouldn't see that on a ward in England - you wouldn't see people singing like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will, who had arrived in Sierra Leone without the backing of an international organisation, spoke of his determination to perform a role that so many had simply refused. &quot;In nursing terms, I'm not particularly experienced, or skilled, but in this situation I can really make a difference and make things a lot less bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I continued to check in with Will with text messages and a few phone calls. I was worried for his safety and I wanted him to know that he had not been forgotten. He remained buoyant despite the overwhelming challenges. There were rumours that the Red Cross would turn up with more staff and of logistical support from Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) but, a week later, things were moving slowly and nothing concrete had happened. Will spoke again about the lack of staff working night shifts, more nurses getting sick and case numbers continuing to increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On my second visit to Kenema, two weeks later, it seemed that the hospital was turning a corner. Support had arrived in the form of MSF and the World Health Organisation. Patients were being moved into a new ward. There was better sanitation. Staff training and a restructuring of the unit were improving conditions at the hospital for patients and health workers. Will assured me: &quot;It's a lot safer, it's a lot cleaner environment for the patients and the staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told me how patients who received a negative test result after recovering were showered, given a fresh set of clothes, a certificate declaring they were Ebola-free and a small amount of money for the ride home. Relatives usually gathered to meet them and there were emotional outpourings of thanks to the hospital staff and God - a beautiful moment for patients and staff that brought some light to an otherwise dark situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's great, it's great, seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state and seeing them on the wards and thinking they're probably going to die. But to see them recover and walk out the door is great.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will was flanked by a group of upbeat young women who had all been discharged and were keen to take a photograph before they said goodbye. He was clearly popular among the patients and fond of them. &quot;They were all together on this one ward,&quot; he said pointing to the women. &quot;It will be so quiet in there now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patients held Nurse William in high esteem, and so did his colleagues. Yoko spent a lot of time on the ward alongside Will. &quot;We have a lot to thank William for - he has motivated us, he has encouraged us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matron Josephine Sellu, the leader of the hospital, shared a similar sentiment. &quot;William has come here and offered to help in this war against Ebola. We thank him for that. He has taught us things. He has helped our nurses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time I saw Will, he told me: &quot;At the start, especially, I could feel the weight of the horror that is the inside of the Ebola ward but you quickly get used to it. I don't go on to the ward each morning with that same dread of the corpses and blood that I did to start with. It has become a bit routine now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of personal safety and that of his colleagues was a concern for Will. But becoming infected did not seem like an option for him. He assured me at one point that &quot;the PPE that we wear protects you against Ebola, full stop really. If you wear it and you don't make any mistakes and everything is done properly then you will never catch Ebola when you are working&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not take the same risks that colleagues had taken. &quot;I operate very differently to local nurses. A simple example is that it's very normal for staff to eat onsite in a moment of going in and out of the ward. I don't do that. So I'm protected by circumstance in some ways and also I'm a lot more afraid than the local nurses so I take more precautions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the small and close community in Freetown heard of Will's positive test result on Saturday, it was a devastating blow and a cruel reminder of what we all know - those most at risk of catching Ebola are health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, like Yoko at the Ebola unit, were shattered by the news but hopeful about the treatment he will receive. &quot;He will be OK, he will receive proper care in England, we will miss him though,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I watched the grainy news footage of Will, encased in plastic, being taken off an RAF plane surrounded by a scrum of medical experts, I wondered what was going through his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To arrive in one of the poorest countries in Africa and spend two months nursing patients suffering one of the world's deadliest diseases is an extraordinary experience. To then contract that disease and be transported to the most sophisticated treatment unit on Earth is unfathomable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will, like so many health workers in Sierra Leone, is a humble hero. His work has saved dozens of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I left Kenema I asked him what he planned to do when he left. &quot;I'll get a motorbike and travel around Sierra Leone. I'll feel great because I know I've earned it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoinette Sendolo and Pinket Scott From Margibi County</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">574 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of the Dolo's Town Community which is currently being quarantined in Margibi County have expressed serious disappointment over what they refer to as abandonment by the government of Liberia. The Dolo's Town community has been quarantined for a little over one week now due to the recent outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus which is said to have claimed the lives of several people in that part of the country and leaving others affected by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to residents of the community the situation is embarrassing for them because they no longer have freedom to go about their normal activities, adding that the decision to quarantine the area was done without initial information given to the community dwellers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this paper, Esther Toe, believed to be in her late sixties, disclosed that since the quarantine process began the government has failed to meet their daily needs until yesterday when people who she referred to as the stronger once were seen receiving a cup of rice per person which she refused and later asked other family out of Dolo's Town to provide her food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the current situation in that part of the country, residents claimed to be faced with series of challenges naming the increase in the prices of commodities and the lack of access to safe drinking water amongst others as a major problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking was a pregnant woman, Monica Laiky, who complained that members of the Police support Unit (PSU) are not allowing them to use the restroom which is just few steps away from the demarcation line drawn by the joint security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said due to the continuous refusal of the PSU they are constrained to use buckets or plastics in their homes at night and even during the day to ease themselves and they have to wait for nightfall to dispose of their wastes in the swamp, something she described as a serious embarrassment for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monica however expressed fear and frustration that she will likely not be allowed to seek medical attention at the Duside Hospital where she normally goes on a monthly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of the Dolo's Town community are however calling on the government to take action in dealing with the current situation they are faced with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the head of the Dolo's Town Health Center which is now considered as an 'Ebola Holding Center', Mr. Mcforlard Kerkulah has called on the government of Liberia to provide Personal Protective Equipment in order for them to carry out their work effectively. Mr. Kerkulah noted that the clinic is not a treatment center but rather helping the process as a holding center where suspected Ebola patients would be kept for the period of 24 hours but complained that patients are being abandoned at the clinic something which he said is not safe for the nurses and even the other patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the clinic has been caring for five suspected Ebola patients but unfortunately one of the suspects expired two days ago and the Ebola response team was contacted but only showed out on yesterday to collect the remains after being kept in the same room with other patients for two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerkulah disclosed that several calls have been made for the suspected Ebola patients to be taken out of the center for further treatment but to no avail. He added that the suspected patients who were sent at the Ebola treatment center in Monrovia were sent back on grounds that there was no space at the treatment center to accommodate them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Light showers on Thursday, August 21st did not prevent Executives of Cellcom from making a donation of building materials to health officials from the C. H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Margibi County to construct improved facilities intended to contain the spread of Ebola in that county.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation from Cellcom will enable the hospital to become better prepared for dealing with the nation's ongoing crisis and is expected to save many lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of Cellcom's Board of Directors, Mr. AviZaidenberg was joined at the turning over ceremony by Cellcom's CEO Mr. John Vasikaran, its Chief Operating Officer Mr. William Saamoi, and Corporate Communications Strategist Dr. Kimmie Weeks to donate the materials to a team of officials representing the county including District #3 Representative &amp; Secretary of the Margibi Legislative Caucus, Mr. Stephen S. Kafi, Jr., Superintendent &amp; Chairman, Margibi County Task Force on Ebola, Hon. John Z. Buway, Dr. AdolphusYeiah, Acting County Health Officer and Mr. Gregory W. Walker, Margibi County Health Administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporate Communications Strategist Dr. Kimmie Weeks outlined that in the face of the Ebola emergency, Cellcom was continuing its long standing tradition of putting the cause of the country before profit making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He underscored that Cellcom has always remained dedicated to the goal of supporting progress and development in Liberia, and in a major national crisis such as Ebola, Cellcom would continue to stand with the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The Ebola crisis is a national emergency which is ravaging our country, and Cellcom has made a conscious decision to do whatever it takes to support national efforts to stop the spread of this menacing Virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning over the three trucks of materials to Margibi county authorities, Cellcom's CEO Mr. John Vasikaran said his company would do whatever it took to bring Ebola to a halt. &quot;We love Liberia and we love the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is heartbreaking to us when we see a silent killer such as Ebola causing so much damage to this country and so we have committed ourselves to doing whatever it takes to put a stop to this silent killer,&quot; said Vasikaran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In accepting the materials, County officials thanked Cellcom for being the first company to come to the aid of Margibi's largest referral hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They highlighted the difficulties the hospital had been facing in coping with the virus since its outbreak and said that the donation from Cellcom would help the county become more effective and efficient in treating and controlling the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation from Cellcom is targeted at upgrading current health facilities at the C. H. Rennie Hospital and will play a key role in better positioning the facility to control the spread of Ebola in Margibi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation to the hospital is one of many projects Cellcom is currently supporting publicly and anonymously in the interest of helping Liberia recover from what is being termed as the world's worst outbreak of the most dangerous virus known to man.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Liberia continues to struggle with the largest and most complex outbreak of Ebola in history, the World Health Organization (WHO) says it is working with the government and other partners to intensify the Ebola response by injecting new assets into Liberia's health sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement comes following the UN high level delegation's meetings with government officials, NGOs and other partners to review and fill the gaps in the ongoing Ebola response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a joint news conference Friday, Karin Landgren, Special Representative to the UN Secretary General said Ebola in Liberia must be addressed to ensure a stable economy, society and future for Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN SRSG added that the magnitude of the Ebola outbreak requires a higher level of coordination than previous responses, stressing that the UN Mission in Liberia will play a strong role in such effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 22 August, there have been 1,082 cases and 624 deaths reported. Ebola virus is putting strains on society and areas outside the disease itself. Systems for common and sometimes serious health conditions are not functioning as they should. Increasingly, mothers and children cannot access the care they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, Dr. David Nabarro, UN Secretary-General Coordinator for Ebola Response, working with the WHO termed the outbreak of the Ebola in Liberia as extraordinary outbreak that requires an unprecedented response in all dimensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nabarro said the new coordinating platform that engages government, partners and the UN will bring a new level of accountability, and will integrate effective action to ensure the right resources get to the areas they are needed most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that stepping up the health aspects of the outbreak iskey to stopping the virus by firstly identifying those who are sick early and caring for them in health facilities and protecting others so the disease does not spread to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that the number of patient beds available in care centres in Monrovia is insufficient for the number of patients expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, WHO Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda said his team has seen some of the care centers in Monrovia that have been set up by the Ministry of Health and Medecins Sans Frontier and other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Fukuda explained that they have also recognized that containing the Ebola outbreak will require many more care centers and beds for patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said although Ebola has a high fatality rate, experience has shown that even without new medicines, proper treatment of person increases chance of survival. In addition, he said if it continues unabated, the Ebola outbreak could pose an additional risk to other health issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Dealing With Deadly Force Order</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">512 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly A Week following a shooting incident in the Township of West Point in which a 16-year-old boy was seriously injured and subsequently died, new accounts have emerged in which Defense Minister Brownie Samukai has shifted from previous comments. At the time of the incident, Minister Samukai said Shaka Kamara got wounded as a result a barbed wire cutting. However, following careful review of photographs and videos from the protest, the Minister conceded that it was both lethal and non lethal force that was used.&quot;I can tell you that after careful review of all of the photographs and videos from the West Point riots last week, it has been established that both lethal and non lethal weapons were used in the shootings. It is on the basis of the new findings and development that the government has decided to set up a board of inquiry,&quot; Brownie Samukai told journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Wednesday, Little Shaka and two others were shot as security forces attempted to break-up a protest in West Point after the government had issued an order to quarantine the township to prevent suspected Ebola patients from coming to the city center. A week before the shooting, some 17 suspected ebola patients who had been treated at an isolation center, escaped the area following riot. They were pursued, re-arrested and taken back to the center in West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latest Shift in the Minister's statement expunged previous assertion that Shaka was wounded by barbe wire. The truth of the matter is that the boy's leg burst as a consequence of gunshots which eventually led to his demise following persistent bleeding. The use of force by state security against armless civilians was disproportionate and unwarranted for which a probe committee has been constituted. Minister Samukai's comments, though contradictory, should form the basis of the investigation. Also, it is important to consider the latest comment by the minister in which he said no shoot order was issued. If this is true, then who issued the shoot order? On account of this, the top military officer must be brought before the panel to explain who gave the orders because Liberia is not at war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It Would Be premature to call for Minister Samukai's dismissal, even though his shifting comments suggest that he did err. However, we cannot be conclusive in the absence of a comprehensive report. It is also possible that the Minister may have relied on one of his senior officers who fed him with half-baked information without thoroughly verifying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister Finds himself in a precarious situation especially in the post Ellen Corkrum era, when he played a key role in divulging sensitive government information to the former RIA managing director which exposed the president and her government to ridicule and scorn. From all indications, this might be the end of the road for the Defense Minister who took the army from nowhere to somewhere. It is important to deal with the deadly force instruction from the Defense Minister because security men usually do not act on their own except they are given orders to act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">WAJA Consoles Ebola Affected Countries</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">638 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West African Journalists Association (WAJA) has extended condolences and solidarity with the governments and peoples in the sub-region affected by the Ebola outbreak, and calls on the media to double its support in fighting back the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WAJA says the media is under social and ethical obligation to serve the greater good of humanity in these critical times of heightened fear of death caused by the rapid spread of the disease in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While noting the extraordinary efforts of the media so far in disseminating behavioral change messages, WAJA challenged authorities to manage the aggression of the virus carefully as it poses greater threat to the health and stability of the entire region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sub-regional media body is therefore calling on the media in non-affected countries to get seized of the emergency by providing public education to their population to prevent the outbreak of the disease. So far the disease has killed over one thousand, one hundred people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WAJA President Peter Quaqua said, &quot;It is our collective responsibility to prevent the spread of the disease, but state authorities have the greatest responsibility in providing hope for the suffering people in these difficult times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Quaqua said it is understandable that the rapid spread of the virus is causing panic across the region, but governments are under obligation to manage the anxieties of their citizens and not to escalate their worries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WAJA says its attention has been drawn to the unfortunate closure of the National Chronicle Newspaper in Liberia and joins its affiliate, the Press Union of Liberia, in calling on the Government to rethink its decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Press Union of Liberia, the action is &quot;a further expression of intolerance and an unwarranted attack on the free press, and calls upon President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to immediately denounce this action... and reopen the National Chronicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of armed police acting without court order on August 14 violently seized the paper in an operation that caused panic in the streets of Monrovia. The paper's publisher, Philipbert Brown informed the Press Union in a complaint that three trucks load of heavily armed police from the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), threw tear gas in the office before breaking the door to the main entrance. The police is said to have taken away &quot;two laptops and arrested two of the paper's senior staff,&quot; according to Mr. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police action followed a series of publications by the paper including one on the alleged formation of an interim government to replace the Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days after the police action, the Ministry of Information wrote a letter to the Publisher on August 16 suspending the operation of the paper pending the conclusion of ongoing investigation by the national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without dismissing the ethical and &quot;urgent national security concerns&quot; of the government, WAJA says no unethical action justifies another. The media rights group says it is worried that the Liberian Government is still keen on using coercive power to control the media even when the courts are opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A release says the Liberian Government needs to understand that no moral lesson is taught when arbitrary action is the option. While identifying with the frustration of government in containing the disease, WAJA said the government cannot afford to demobilize any segment of the society in fighting the disease and should not therefore use the state of emergency as an alibi to aggravate an already worsening crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, WAJA calls on the media to exhibit the highest extent of professionalism at all times, including these trying times, however critical the story might be to preserve the public good.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">540 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Liberia Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan says while it is understandable that countries not affected by the Ebola outbreak may take measures to protect their citizens, they should heed the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations which do not support travel or trade restrictions on Liberia and other countries hit by the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Foreign Minister has described as disproportionate and exaggerated actions by some African countries to impose both land and air travel restrictions on citizens of countries affected by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further asserted that these exaggerated reactions may only reflect panic and paranoia rather than expert advice relating to empirical realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In these difficult moments in our countries, we expect our African brothers and sisters across the globe to take actions that will complement measures already undertaken by the affected countries with a view to speedily eradicating the disease. Actions grounded primarily in paranoia may, instead of aiding affected countries, lead to blanket stigmatization of citizens from these countries and may make it doubly difficult for affected countries to effectively combat the Ebola disease&quot;, Foreign Minister Ngafuan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Minister commended the African Union (AU) which will soon dispatch a military medical personnel team to Ebola affected countries including Liberia. The AU team will comprise doctors, professional nurses, infection control officers, social workers, medical data management experts, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While commending all countries, institutions, and individuals that have contributed towards the fight against the Ebola disease in Liberia and other affected countries, Minister Ngafuan also commended all African countries that have already contributed or communicated intentions to contribute to the fight against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made specific mention of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which has already dispatched a five-member team of medical experts to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister also commended the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for committing US$500,000 to aid Liberia's fight against the deadly virus and the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco for continuing flights of Royal Air Maroc (the Moroccan national carrier) to Monrovia and Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister further called on other African countries to follow the lead of these countries rather than taking actions that are not consistent with expert advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Minister made these assertions over the weekend when he spoke to a team of foreign journalists in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, WHO through its spokesman Gregory Hartl, was emphatic in its warning against the imposition of air and sea restrictions: &quot;If you try to shut down air travel and sea travel, you risk affecting to a huge extent the economy, people's livelihoods and their ability to get around without stopping the virus from traveling. You can't ship goods in. Sometimes these goods are basic staples people need to survive -- food and fuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO further emphasized that official border closures would constrain resources to address the epidemic and would not stop all means of travel outside of affected areas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-level delegation of U.S. medical experts and emergency responders, led by Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Tom Frieden, is in Liberia to see firsthand the impact of the Ebola outbreak and to assess response activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also in Liberia to hear from government officials, international partners and health care workers in West Africa to see what can be done to stop the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia is the first stop on CDC Director Frieden's trip to the region, which will also take him to Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Frieden is accompanied by Dr. Tom Kenyon, Director of CDC's Center for Global Health, and Jeremy Konyndyk, Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).They arrived in Monrovia on August 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Frieden held a one-on-one meeting with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Monday, and later met with most of the members of Liberia's National Task Force on Ebola, including President Sirleaf, Vice President Joseph Boakai, President Pro Temp of the Senate Alex Tyler, Speaker of the House Gbehzohngar Findley and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Francis S. Korkpor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. delegation led by Dr. Frieden will also meet this week with the Minister of Health and Social Welfare Dr. Walter Gwenigale, Liberian health care workers and tour hospitals where Ebola patients are being treated as well as tour a laboratory operated by the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research (LIBR) and a mobile lab, which the U.S. Government sent to Liberia last week to improve Ebola specimen testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CDC Director Frieden will also hold talks this week with high-level UN officials to hear about the international community's response to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 24, the U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Ebola Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), sent more than 16 tons of medical equipment and emergency supplies to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplies included 10,000 sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); two water treatment units and two water portable water tanks, capable of holding 10,000 liters of water each and 100 rolls of plastic sheeting, which can be used in the construction of Ebola treatment centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplies will be distributed in partnership with the Liberian government, World Food Program (WFP), and local partners to places of need around Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 23, a cargo plane--funded by UNICEF and the DART-- landed in Monrovia, carrying more than 40 tons of chlorine and 400,000 pairs of medical gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of laboratory experts from CDC, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is working with Liberia to set up laboratories and train more laboratory workers to expand laboratory capacity to conduct more efficient and quicker Ebola testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, members of the DART have made several assessment trips and met with officials at the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to determine how and where to expand the number of Ebola treatment centers in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, USAID deployed the DART to Monrovia, Liberia and Conakry, Guinea to oversee the U.S. Government's regional response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 18, the DART announced it was sending additional staff to Sierra Leone to work with non-governmental organizations and U.N. agencies on the ground. Monrovia, Liberia is the regional hub for the U.S. government's Ebola response activities. The DART now comprises 27 staff across various U.S. government agencies, including USAID, CDC, the U.S. Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Forest Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first two weeks of August, CDC increased its staff in the region to battle Ebola. There are currently more than 65 CDC disease-control experts working in West Africa: 27 in Sierra Leone, 21 in Liberia, 15 in Guinea and 6 in Nigeria. These experts are providing technical expertise to national public health agencies in the region to help prevent, detect, and stop the spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Ebola outbreak was first reported in March 2014, the U.S. Government, through USAID, has committed more than $14.5 million to the response. The funding has been used to provide more technical experts, PPE, health supplies, field laboratories and diagnostic capacity, training, and public service messaging campaigns, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early stages of the Ebola outbreak, the U.S. Defense Department's Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the office in charge of countering weapons of mass destruction, and the U.S. State Department also provided PPE to the Liberian government, including surgical gowns, sets of protective coveralls, boxes of protective gloves, and decontamination hand sprayers. The CDC and DTRA also sent in several teams of infectious disease experts to assist Liberian authorities to test Ebola specimens, track Ebola patients and their contacts, and to develop public awareness campaigns to try to stop the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">We Acknowledge With Elation News of West Point Shooting Probe</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">692 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT ELLEN JOHNSON Sirleaf has ordered the constitution of a panel to investigate the shooting incident that occurred in the crowded slum community of West Point. Armed Liberian security operatives reportedly opened fire on residents of the peninsular enclave as they protested the establishment of an Ebola center. The shooting incident has reportedly claimed one life and injured at least three other unarmed citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF what actually occurred at West Point has come from various sources. While a couple of media outlets have reported that there was a sustained firing of live bullets and tear gas on the demonstrators, government spokespersons maintained that the reported death and injuries are not a result of the shooting. The Government spokespersons have so far provided seemingly conflicting accounts, particularly on the volume or number of firearm discharges carried out by security forces that represented the Liberia National Police and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) on the scene. Some said a single bullet, others said two, fired consistent with the &quot;rules of engagement&quot; to scare the demonstrators who they claim were nearly posing threat to the presence of the security forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE SHOOTING INCIDENT--whether or not it is to be blamed for the death and injuries reported--has gathered and increased clouds of suspicion over Government's military showdown proffered as part of the remedy to curb the Ebola virus which is reportedly spreading fast in the country and claiming untold lives. The Government of Liberia has declared a state of emergency that is further enforced by a nighttime curfew across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOME CITIZENS AT home and abroad have expressed alarm and shock at the militarization of the country in the name of fighting Ebola; the initial results of the militarization expressed in the West Point shooting and the attending casualties. Of particular concern to pundits and stakeholders in Liberia's recovery process is what the possible role of the Armed Forces of Liberia might be in the incident. The AFL, which inherited notorious human rights history from its forebears, was subjected to architectural and moral transformation, with funding from the United States of America and other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS UNMIL HAS been in charge of national security, which has remained congenial in the last decade and more, the AFL has not been under any serious military pressure as to deal and interact with the civilian population. The first assignment is peacekeeping in Mali until the declaration of the state of emergency which unshelled the soldiers of the national army out of their barracks back to the streets of Monrovia and beyond. Reportedly present at the West Point shooting incident and with all the reports of death and injuries, the AFL and its counterparts, the LNP, have recharged bitter memories of the dark days of unfriendly relations with the Liberian civilian populace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS WHY we strongly feel elated that President Sirleaf has ordered an immediate probe of the shooting incident and placing the Armed Forces of Liberia squarely in the center of it all. According to reports the President has ordered Defense Minister Samukai to set up a board of inquiry and within 10 days determines the facts and circumstances leading to the shooting situation and report to her for further action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUR SIMPLE PLEA, and with all due respect to the panel, is that the investigation should be comprehensive, transparent and fair. And more than anything else that the outcome will represent the truth of the matter and nothing but the truth and that the outcome will not be shelved as with the case of other violent incidents, including the 2011 elections violence and the NPA violence, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN WAKE OF UNMIL drawdown, when fears mount that our own security forces, particularly the AFL, may not ably fill the vacuum, the West Point incident as well as the ordered probe represents a litmus test for the national army. We, and perhaps the entire nation and international community, are watching with the eye of an Eagle to see if millions spent on the remaking of the army worth the venture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1015 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERO NURSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY SAM MARSDEN AND NICK FAGGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British nurse struck down by ebola had spoken of his joy at seeing his patients recover - just days before contracting the disease himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiling broadly in his blue scrubs, William Pooley remained upbeat despite working up to 18 hours a day surrounded by death in a desperately understaffed hospital in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven days later, he is being treated on a London ward having been airlifted back to the UK by the RAF after catching ebola from the very victims he was trying to save.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley, 29, had graphically depicted the horror in African hospital where he had selflessly volunteered to help those stricken by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was forced to make the painful decision to leave sufferers alone overnight after the other staff fled. It came after angry locals rioted outside the hospital in response to rumours that ebola was a ruse to steal sufferers' blood and harvest their organs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We gave the patients water and paracetamol and then we had to walk out,' he said. Patients are dying the most horrible deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm expecting to find several corpses tomorrow morning.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, colleagues said yesterday that Mr Pooley was so dedicated to helping the people of Sierra Leone that he could return to the country to complete his volunteer nursing placement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Madiye, executive director of a local hospice where the Briton had worked, said he had pledged to stay in the West African nation for another six months before being struck down, adding: He had a lot of compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He loved people, he loved patient care, and he went into the community to reach out to patients.' Mr Pooley was pictured in a white infection control suit at the hospital in Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and a hot-spot for ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He remained positive when he was interviewed less than a fortnight ago, choosing to focus on the patients who had recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state,' he told the Guardian newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the British nurse also spoke of chronic staffing shortages, the excruciating pain of ebola sufferers, mothers watching their children die, and how patients had to lie next to corpses for hours because there were not enough staff to move the bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference. I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping,' he told Sierra Leone-based blogger Jo Dunlop. Fellow volunteer Professor Robert Garry, of Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, praised Mr Pooley's dedication to his ebola patients. He said: Will was working longer and harder than just about anyone out there. He was putting in 12 to 18-hour days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been understaffed at the hospital. Nursing staff have been afraid to go in.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Oliver Johnson, who has also been helping ebola victims in Sierra Leone, said Mr Pooley was an extraordinary guy' who knew the risks involved but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley's family yesterday praised the doctors treating him at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said in a statement: We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will is receiving excellent care and we could not ask for him to be in a better place. We would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley was said to be not currently seriously unwell' and his doctors are thought to be confident that he has a good chance of fighting the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He travelled to Sierra Leone in March to carry out a six-month volunteer placement as a palliative care nurse for people with HIV, cancer and tuberculosis at the Shepherd's Hospice in the capital Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the ebola outbreak took hold he asked for permission five weeks ago to transfer to Kenema Government Hospital to help those affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Madiye said: He is a very brave man. He told me he would go in the morning and work for 12 hours. I asked why. He said, &quot;we can't easily find nurses because they are all fearful of contracting the ebola virus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We feel so happy that the British Government has been able to airlift him to relative safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are hopeful that he will recover and come back to provide a service for Sierra Leonians.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr Pooley told him hours before he was flown back to Britain that he was feeling positive despite being diagnosed with the dreaded disease - and promised to call again within a fortnight for an update on his progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In emails to his family, Mr Pooley described his life in Sierra Leone, including a village meeting where he was singled out by dancing devils' because of his white skin. He said he lived with Mr Madiye for his first few weeks in the largest and most comfortable house in the area, but it had electricity for only a couple of hours in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the most basic tasks were time-consuming. Laundry had to be performed by hand, cooking was done over a fire, one pot at a time, and hot coals were used for ironing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley grew up in a close-knit family in an idyllic rural setting in the Suffolk village of Eyke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After school he travelled extensively, taking a course in teaching English as a foreign language in Calcutta as well as visiting Indonesia and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley's parents Robin and Jackie, who ran a removals firm, were last night at the London hospital where he is being treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One neighbour said: They are a lovely family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are with him in London - not at his bedside but they are as close as they can be given the circumstances.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, British universities are on high alert for possible cases of ebola ahead of the arrival of thousands of foreign students for the start of the academic year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and relatives of patients at the Royal Free Hospital in North London, have spoken of their shock at finding out a victim of the ebola virus was being treated in the same building as their loved ones.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Burbridge, 53, said she was taken aback' when she arrived with her daughter in labour yesterday to find several TV cameras trained on the Hampstead hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grandmother-of-four, from Holborn, said: If it hadn't been so urgent last night, then maybe I would have tried to go somewhere else. It's such a deadly disease - it is a worry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed busier yesterday in the canteen; I've noticed a lot fewer people today, maybe because of what's happened.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ena Bradish, 78, who was visiting a friend at the hospital, said: I think they're taking a real risk in bringing him here that it could spread to the UK, why can't they treat him where he is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They might save him but I'm worried he'll kill more people infecting them - and our health service can do without that to deal with.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the risk, many Londoners said they supported the Royal Free Hospital for helping the British nurse. Russell Marshall, 47, said: I'm not one of those &quot;not in my backyard&quot; sorts of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have the benefits of living by a big hospital so this is also a consequence of that which we have to deal with. I have full faith that it will be contained,' he added. Relatives of long-term patients had been informed in advance that any British ebola victims would be taken to the Royal Free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penny Hopkins, 53, who has visited her mother daily for the past five weeks, said: I knew they would come here if there was a case - it's the only place they can go - but I just didn't think it was actually going to happen.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The childcare worker from West Hampstead added: If it was a member of my family, I'd want them to go to the best place possible.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her brother Ben Elgar said he had been reassured by doctors, who hadn't seemed too bothered' by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 42-year-old accountant said: When I first found out, I was quite shocked - but the doctors seemed very confident and told me they had no concerns as he was completely isolated.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other visitors praised the doctors. Medical student Catherine McCrann, 26, said: I think they are doing a great job here - it's nice to hear some positive news about a hospital.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her boyfriend Martin Catterall, who injured his little finger playing rugby on Sunday, said he was given a leaflet explaining the situation in the A&amp;E waiting room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 31-year-old auditor from Kentish Town said: At first I thought it was a little risky, but when I found out he was a British national and it was the only place for him, I thought fair enough.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is ZMapp a cure for ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present there is no proven vaccine or cure for the deadly virus, but an experimental new drug holds hope of saving lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two American aid workers infected with ebola recovered after being given the untested medication, known as ZMapp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far it is unclear whether they survived thanks to the drug or as a result of other treatment they received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other victims - including a senior Liberian doctor and a Spanish priest working in West Africa - have died despite receiving ZMapp.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How else can you treat ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard treatment involves giving intravenous fluids, antibiotics and oxygen until the patient's immune system is strong enough to fight off the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this kind of care is all but impossible in the desperately poor African countries where the ebola outbreak has taken hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stopping an outbreak requires isolating sufferers, stopping chains of transmission, good infection control in hospitals and safe burial practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will other victims receive ZMapp?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US-developed drug is highly experimental, and supplies are extremely limited. Only 12 doses of ZMapp were made initially and they have now all been used, according to London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine professor David Mabey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will take weeks and perhaps months to manufacture more of the drug, and it will be several years before full clinical trials are complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does ZMapp work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drug contains a cocktail of laboratory-made monoclonal antibodies' engineered to stop the ebola virus from entering the human body's cells. It is made using genetically modified tobacco plants grown on a US scientific research site in Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will William Pooley be given it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health says it has not ruled out' using an experimental therapy on the British nurse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any decision to use an untested drug will be taken by Mr Pooley along with his doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are other drugs being developed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes. Japan said it is ready to supply a new anti-influenza drug called Favipiravir as a possible means of treating ebola. And Canadian drugs firm Immunovaccine has reported promising results in tests on monkeys for its ebola vaccine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley has never sought fame and celebrity for himself, and yet his arrival in Britain yesterday aboard an RAF plane was covered by live television. The reason for this interest was that Mr Pooley had contracted the Ebola virus while in Sierra Leone, and was being taken to a London hospital for treatment. Some have warned of the risks of importing such a deadly disease; but it is emblematic of the gulf between advanced and developing countries that we can isolate and treat victims without triggering an outbreak here whereas countries such as Sierra Leone and Guinea have no such facilities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was to help address this impoverishment that encouraged Mr Foley to go to Africa as a volunteer nurse, one of thousands of humanitarian workers who travel to the world's trouble spots or disaster areas motivated only by a desire to help others. He had already been working in a hospice in Sierra Leone providing palliative care before then moving to a hospital to work with Ebola patients. An executive with the Christian charity for which he works calls him &quot;a hero&quot;, a word often bandied about but which seems singularly appropriate here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a proper description, too, of the doctors, nurses, engineers, drivers and other aid workers currently working in dreadful circumstances in Syria, Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan - not least because their status is no longer the guarantor of safety that it once was. Last year was the most dangerous on record for humanitarian workers, with 155 killed, 171 seriously wounded and 134 kidnapped. So far this year, 79 aid workers have died, according to figures compiled by the Humanitarian Outcomes partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, many are the unwitting victims of increased humanitarian spending by state donors. With the extra funds, aid agencies can push further into conflict zones where the needs are greatest, but where staff are exposed to worsening levels of violence. The impartiality of aid workers should be respected by all sides in a war; but such an appeal is unlikely to sway the murderous jihadists in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere who consider anyone fair game for kidnap and killing. Some foreign aid workers are accused of acting as spies; others are targeted because they work for Christian organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not just war zones that pose risks to aid and rescue workers. They run the risk of succumbing to disease or injury while helping to find or treat the victims of disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. Or, like Mr Pooley, they voluntarily put themselves in harm's way, motivated not by the desire to be well known, but by selfless sacrifice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN'S first Ebola victim may be treated with a new flu drug after the medicine was offered to the NHS by Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The drug, called favipiravir or Avigan, its brand name, prevents the virus from multiplying and was made available for treating Ebola patients after experts found similarities with the flu virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several experimental drugs are under consideration by doctors treating William Pooley, 29, a volunteer nurse who contracted Ebola while treating victims in a remote area of Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was flown home in an isolation unit on an RAF plane and taken directly to the Royal Free Hospital in north London which has an isolation unit for patients with dangerous infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Alain Kohl, of the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: &quot;There are common aspects between influenza and Ebola and a molecule targeting a common step or process may work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are no approved drugs to treat Ebola, but pharmaceutical companies are trying to get early medicines into clinical trials. However, there is a risk when a drug is tested on people for the first time, and doctors will be reluctant to chance an untested treatment on a patient, Dr Kohl said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Generally, the patient's health would be stabilised by balancing fluids and electrolytes, maintaining blood pressure and treating any other infections, i.e. bacterial, that could worsen the condition. If the patient's condition deteriorates, a decision to test an experimental drug has to be taken,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patients may recover with supportive treatment alone, such as through provision of intravenous fluids and maintaining of oxygen levels, especially when, as in the case of Mr Pooley, the disease is caught early. Doctors have said Mr Pooley is not seriously unwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifty-seven per cent of people known to have caught Ebola in the current outbreak have died. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the magnitude has been underestimated, and many more may have been killed without being recorded. WHO said counting new graves has been the only way to estimate deaths in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak is the biggest recorded, and experts have warned that experimental drugs are not likely to make a significant impact because they are in such short supply. ZMapp, a drug used to treat two American missionaries, has run out and more will not be available for several months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British nurse who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone gave an interview days before he fell ill in which he spoke of his joy at seeing patients recover from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Pooley, 29, who volunteered to help care for Ebola patients because local nurses were too afraid, is credited with saving dozens of lives by making sure a hospital at the centre of the outbreak remained open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colleagues said he caught the disease, transmitted through contact with blood or other bodily fluids, because he was working such long hours that he was bound to &quot;make a mistake&quot; in his precautions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley, from Eyke, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, is being treated in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital, in Hampstead, north London, after being flown home on Sunday by the RAF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His family released a statement yesterday in which they said he was receiving &quot;excellent&quot; care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Health said he was &quot;not seriously unwell&quot; when he arrived but experts said it could be months before he is cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley was interviewed by The Guardian newspaper more than a week ago, before he fell ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said of his patients in Kenema: &quot;It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state, seeing them on the wards, and then seeing them recover and walk out the door is great.&quot; In an interview with a local blogger earlier this month, he said: &quot;It's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His family can see him only through a plastic tent which prevents the infection from spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They released a statement in which they said: &quot;We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Will is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same health care facilities as Will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley originally went to Sierra Leone as a volunteer for six months in the country's only hospice after hearing about the dire situation during a presentation to nursing students by the charity group UK Friends of The Shepherd's Hospice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charity organisers have described the male nurse as a &quot;hero&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His close friend Gabriel Madiye, the director of the hospice in the country's capital, Freetown, said: &quot;We advised Will not to go to Kenema but patients were being abandoned in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was no one else there to care for them and he decided he must fill the gap. He is not a religious man. He describes himself as a humanist. He believes in helping people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But he told me he had been working 12-hour days because the local health care workers were fearful of Ebola patients. Ebola is such a contagious disease that a very small error can lead to infection, especially when there is no running water and hygiene is so terrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Robert Garry, an American scientist who worked at the same hospital, said: &quot;When you work hard like that, when you put in so many hours, you're going to make a mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unfortunately that seems to have happened in this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Oliver Johnson, who has been treating patients in Freetown, said: &quot;He is an extremely modest guy. He wasn't at all interested in recognition. He would be cringing if he knew the media were talk-ing about him. But in a very quiet way he would work enormous hours to help protect the other staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the darkest days in Kenema it was really his determination and leadership that motivated others to keep going there and keep the hospital open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kenema was ground zero for the outbreak and he was one of only a handful of nurses helping treat up to 50 Ebola patients that were admitted there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He showed enormous compassion for his patients. Will's a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He and I spoke about the risk together and I think he absolutely understood that there were risks involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But where he was in Kenema a number of staff had become sick. He was a hugely professional nurse and a hugely dedicated one, so he understood those [risks] but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley's father, Robin, is a former teacher who set up a removals business, Pooley Removals, with his wife Jackie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They later sold the business but still work for it and Mrs Pooley is also the clerk on the parish council in Eyke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Mutten, a parish councillor in the village, said: &quot;His family are very proud of him. He has been all over the world and his work is all voluntary. He is doing his bit for society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Pooley tested positive for Ebola on Saturday. There is no cure for the virus and outbreaks have a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent, though that figure is less than 50 per cent for victims who are treated in western countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nurse arrived in Sierra Leone on March 25 and worked at the hospice until early July, when he went to the Kenema Government Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: &quot;William Pooley demonstrated incredible bravery. We wish him a speedy recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Tony Blair does appear to have positioned himself as a very particular kind of crisis management adviser. Anyone can lend a hand to virtuous sorts facing opprobrium. Only a few very skilled practitioners could, or would want to, assist those enduring the sting of national or international disapproval. We now know that he offered media strategy advice to Kazakh strongman Nursultan Nazarbayev when the autocrat faced international criticism over the killing of 15 civilian protesters by police. This is the tone to take, Blair said. He even crafted changes to the old brute's speech. But none should be surprised, for didn't Blair also lend his undoubted talents to Rebekah Brooks when News International faced public hostility for hacking Milly Dowler's mobile phone? Rebekah's no Nazarbayev, but there's a trend taking shape of Blair - the Red Adair of spin - dashing to the rescue when others won't. Friend to the friendless, that's him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;And as a result, others - seeing the former PM traduced - will jump to his defence. Loaded magazine reports on the latest to resist the attacks on Blair's reputation. &quot;Some folk thought it was crass of Tony to put on a celebration while acting as Middle East peace envoy. Some say he should be doing more to save the lives of those poor families in Israel and Palestine. But surely he's entitled to have a night off from his responsibilities to celebrate his wife's 60th birthday? I wouldn't care for his job - not for all the tea in China, thank you. But someone has to do it.&quot; So says Bobby Davro - comedian, impressionist, once a big beast in the world of entertainment. He seems to understand what Blair's job is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;An eye-opener when a man accustomed to shaping the news becomes news himself. This is the lot of Jeremy Paxman, who effortlessly segued from Newsnight to his one-man Edinburgh show. There were write-ups of that, mostly favourable, and more recently a rash of column inches about what he's doing next. He's talking to Channel 4, said an excitable series of headlines: negotiations are under way. And this might be right. But it might also be the maximum level of hype to be wrung from a single unsolicited phone call. Still, Jeremy won't be unduly aggrieved. He can look out for himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;With Ebola on the front pages, time to reflect on the context provided by Rick Wiles, the hardline evangelical and US talk show host. He sees the horror inflicted by Ebola, but, ever the optimist, Rick sees an upside. &quot;This Ebola epidemic could become a global pandemic and that's another name for plague,&quot; he said. &quot;It may be the great attitude adjustment that I believe is coming. Ebola could solve America's problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography and abortion.&quot; So, not all bad, says Rick. America must feel lucky to have him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Meanwhile, Fred Jarvis, the former teachers' union boss, hits the grand age of 90, and a good 90 it is by all accounts. Battle-hardened, unapologetic, unafraid. Invitations to his birthday party next month carry a motif in the corner saying: &quot;Gove is gone but I'm still here.&quot; The one-time general secretary of the National Union of Teachers detailed his multiple objections to Gove in his recent autobiography. &quot;I do not want to get off the education bus, even if it is in danger of being driven over the cliff by an obsessed ideologue,&quot; he said. At the time of writing, he wasn't to know that Gove was about to be satisfyingly humiliated and forced from the Department for Education. Still, he may have had an inkling. Jarvis's memoir is called You Never Know Your Luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Finally, after that prolonged period in 2012 spent denying and then apologising over the use of foul and racially abusive language against Anton Ferdinand, Chelsea's John Terry finds a new role. He's helping the club's Spanish acquisition Diego Costa to integrate. &quot;I am trying to teach him some words in English,&quot; Terry told the Times yesterday. He didn't list those words and they didn't ask. But he'll soon have the boy up to speed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has sent protective equipment for medical staff to the Democratic Republic of the Congo after it became the fifth African country this year to suffer a deadly outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ministry of health has declared an outbreak and we are treating it as such,&quot; Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, told Reuters in Geneva yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo declared on Sunday that Ebola had been identified in its northern Equateur province after two patients tested positive for the virus, but the health minister, Felix Kabange Numbi, denied any link to the epidemic raging in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials believe Ebola has killed 13 other people in the region, including five health workers. Kabange said 11 were ill and in isolation and 80 contacts were being traced, and the Djera area would be placed under quarantine. Djera is about 750 miles (1,200km) from Congo's capital, Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has swept through Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, resulting in 1,427 deaths and 2,615 infections since March. But Kabange said the Congolese epidemic &quot;has nothing to do with the one in west Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the two cases that tested positive was for the Sudanese strain of the virus, he explained, while the other was a mixture of the Sudanese and the Zaire strain - the most dangerous. The virus in west Africa is the Zaire strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola river in Congo and this is the seventh outbreak since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberian doctor treated with an experimental Ebola drug, ZMapp, died late on Sunday, the country's information minister said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at Liberia's largest hospital, had received the untested drug after it was given to two American health workers, who survived after receiving medical care in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Spanish missionary also received the treatment but died. Two health workers are still in treatment, and there were &quot;signs of hope&quot;, said Kabange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan has said it is ready to offer another experimental drug developed by a Japanese company to help stop the epidemic. Avigan was approved as an anti-influenza drug in Japan in March, and its developer Fujifilm Holdings said it had received inquiries about its use against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our country is prepared to provide the yet-to-be approved drug in cooperation with the manufacturer if the WHO requests,&quot; said chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga. David Smith</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley, the British nurse flown back to London after contracting Ebola, spoke of his joy at seeing patients recover from the deadly virus after treatment at the hospital in Sierra Leone where he was volunteering, just days before he fell ill himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old, from the village of Eyke in Suffolk, was said yesterday by his family to be receiving &quot;excellent care&quot; at a specialist unit at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, after being evacuated on an RAF plane on Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a poignant interview with the Guardian at the Kenema government hospital 10 days ago, a smiling Pooley said: &quot;It's great seeing them (the patients) walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state and seeing them on the wards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley, who registered as a nurse in February last year after completing his training, spent five weeks working at the Ebola centre before falling ill. Despite the lack of resources at the hospital, and some staff having fled for fear of contracting Ebola themselves, Pooley and others managed to help a growing number of people recover from the virus, for which there is no proven cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Free provided no update on Pooley's condition yesterday, having said that it would only do so in the event of a significant change. The Department of Health said on Sunday that he was &quot;not currently seriously unwell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Pooley's family said: &quot;We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK. We have been astounded by the speed and way in which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They thanked people for their good wishes and asked them &quot;to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Pooley was being treated with intravenous fluids and body salts in a specially designed tent with a controlled ventilation system yesterday, colleagues who worked alongside him in Sierra Leone praised his selflessness and determination to make a difference despite the risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He flew out to Sierra Leone earlier this year, initially intending to volunteer for six months at a hospice mainly providing care for people with cancer or Aids in the capital, Freetown. During his time at the Shepherd's hospice he wrote emails back to his mother, Jackie, in which he told of the poverty he had encountered and of learning about the horrors of the country's civil war from the people there, who he found &quot;friendly, funny and hospitable&quot;. Describing the local environment, he wrote: &quot;The houses are all mud-sand and palm thatch, the water is from one communal well and, of course, there is no electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left the hospice to help people with Ebola in Kenema, the centre of the outbreak, having become concerned that other healthcare workers were abandoning them. Gabriel Madiye, the hospice's executive director, told the BBC: &quot;We consider him a hero,&quot; and described him as &quot;somebody who is sacrificing to provide care in very difficult circumstances - when our own health workers are running away&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Oliver Johnson, who has been treating patients in Freetown, said his friend Pooley was a professional and dedicated nurse who &quot;absolutely understood that there were risks involved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: &quot;Will's a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave and really from the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could - not just help patients, but I think he had enormous loyalty towards the other staff at Kenema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people, many of them healthcare workers who have treated patients with the virus, which has spread from Guinea, where it originated in March, to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With treatment of the symptoms, which can take weeks or even months, survival is possible. While being treated, Pooley, who was taken under police escort to the Royal Free on Sunday, will be separated from medical staff by plastic and rubber sheets that ensure the virus does not spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health has stressed that the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low. Professor David Heymann, the director of the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security, said Pooley's chances of survival depended on a range of factors including his fitness and how well his body produces antibodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unknown whether he will be given the experimental drug ZMapp, which was used to treat two US aid workers who subsequently recovered. The Department of Health is believed to be trying to obtain supplies of the drug, but the manufacturers have said their stocks have been exhausted. Despite its apparently working on the US aid workers, its use has not been a complete success. It emerged yesterday that a Liberian doctor who received ZMapp died on Sunday. A Spanish missionary priest infected with Ebola also received the treatment and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Mutten, a member of Eyke parish council, where Pooley's mother is a clerk, said everyone in the local community was hoping he would fight off the disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation puts the number of people infected in the latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which has been sweeping through parts of western Africa since March, at 2,615, of whom 1,427 victims have died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But public health officials have stressed there is little or no risk to the general public in the UK, even after the arrival in London this weekend of a British medic infected with the virus while treating patients in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because, although Ebola has a very high mortality rate and no treatment or vaccine has so far been licensed for it, the virus is actually much less contagious than many other more common diseases, and good infection-control practices should effectively stop its spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is certainly deadly. Many of those infected with it are likely to die; around 56% in the current outbreak, and 67% across all outbreaks since the disease's discovery in 1976. But unlike, say, measles, diphtheria or whooping cough, which are airborne and can be caught simply by breathing, Ebola is quite hard to contract; like HIV or hepatitis, it is transmitted through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, either through actual physical contact or via infected objects such as needles or clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strict medical infection control is, therefore, the best answer for preventing the disease's spread - and it is mainly the lack of such strict control in the countries most affected by the recent outbreak (Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria) that is responsible for its severity. In countries with high standards of public healthcare, the risk of transmission is generally considered minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical director of the NHS could not have been much clearer this weekend following the arrival from Sierra Leone of a 29-year-old British healthcare worker, William Pooley, who tested positive for the Ebola virus last week and will now be treated in a special isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have prepared rigorous plans for this type of situation,&quot; said Professor Sir Bruce Keogh. &quot;This individual will pose no risk to the public, and only the tiniest risk to those who those who come into direct contact with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Peter Piot, the Belgian scientist who helped discover the Ebola virus, has even said he &quot;wouldn't be worried to sit next to someone with Ebola virus on the tube - as long as they don't vomit on you or something. This is an infection that requires very close contact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah. Right. Looks like I picked a bad week to draw inspiration from current affairs for this knockabout comedy column. The news is rarely a warehouse of carefree chuckles but at the moment it's like an apocalyptic playlist on perpetual shuffle, with one harrowing crisis overlapping another. Palestine, Libya, Syria . . . it's all horrifying and upsetting. Not a single nice thing has happened all year, except the recent stealth launch of Cadbury's Wispa Biscuits, and even &quot;stealth launch of Wispa Biscuits&quot; sounds like a terrible euphemism for breaking wind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planet is currently playing host to countless alarming crises. There's the nail-biting tension of Russia v Ukraine, a depressing standoff overseen by facial-expression-avoider Vladimir Putin. I don't know if all the strings connecting Putin's face muscles to his brain were accidentally severed during a tragic smiling accident years ago, but I've seen brickwork convey more emotion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of a new cold war is serious, but currently overshadowed by the next item on the playlist: Isis. Or Islamic State, a group that's risen from obscurity to become planet Earth's number one Band of Bogeymen; putting the &quot;hate&quot; into &quot;caliphate&quot;. We hear a lot about Isis seeking to establish a medieval-style Islamic state, which might not seem so frightening if the accent was on reviving the tolerance, harmony, and cultural and scientific advancements of a medieval Islamic state like Al-Andalus, rather than the more barbaric aspects of global medieval history that still prompt winces even when depicted in woodcut form or on tapestries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of young Brits apparently flocking to join Isis has prompted much public soul-searching. &quot;Why are young Muslims angry and disillusioned?&quot; asks the same media that habitually considers hysterical fabrications about Muslims demanding Halal bingo, or whatever, more important than factual reports about Palestinian children being blown to pieces. &quot;What kind of sick glorification are these jihadists seeking?&quot; they wail, while filling the front page with ominous images of &quot;Beatle John&quot; - literally a rock-star nickname - accompanied by text breathlessly recounting his terrifying ruthlessness. &quot;When will the Muslim community do something about this?&quot; they demand, without pausing to consider any potential accountability of their own. The media isn't to blame, but it does very little to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Johnson reckons the best way to thwart potential jihadists is for suspected terrorists to be assumed guilty until proven innocent. He described this as a &quot;swift and minor change&quot; to the law. Yep, just a quick, simple reversal of the entire basis of the British legal system. Making pre-emptive kneejerk assumptions is fun: in fact, I've already decided Boris Johnson is the shittest and most dangerous prime minister Britain's ever had, just to be ahead of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, just as you're coming to terms with Isis, along comes Ebola to get under your skin, literally. If you haven't heard of Ebola, you're living in a bubble. Like anyone who's been exposed to it. It's landed in the UK, but don't worry: apparently you can only catch the disease by existing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a measure of how bleak the news has become that the only showbiz story with any real traction is the one involving historical allegations against Sir Cliff Richard (allegations he denies). At the time of writing, Cliff hasn't been charged or found guilty of anything, except on the internet, where he's already serving concurrent 140-character sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, that's not the only showbiz tale. There's the ice bucket challenge, 2014's Gangnam Style, which is sort of uplifting, in that it involves famous people doing something stupid for charity. The idea is to raise awareness of motor neurone disease by tipping a bucket of iced water over your head and uploading the results to YouTube (having dried the video off first so it doesn't short-circuit the internet). Already popular, it went super-viral once celebrities joined in. David Beckham, Rihanna, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - there were even sexy people too, like Alex Salmond. And Alistair Darling. Of course those two scarcely noticed the ice cold deluge because THEY ARE SCOTTISH AND THAT IS SCOTTISH WEATHER HAHA SCOTLAND.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone's done it. Simon Cowell, Kate Moss, Liam Gallagher, Dennis Nilsen. Former president and Teddy-Ruxpin-faced planet-vandal George W Bush joined in the fun, proving that even dot-eyed locust warmongers appreciate a bit of slapstick. Bush had an ice bucket emptied over his head by wife Laura. He's cheerfully commanded people to use buckets of water before, of course, but back then he called it &quot;waterboarding&quot;. Over three million people have watched his stunt on YouTube, although two million of those stumbled across it accidentally after typing &quot;dripping wet bush&quot; into the search engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, all things considered, 2014 is going to have to strain really hard to engineer some pleasant news before the end of December if things are going to balance out. That IS how the universe works, right? Good things eventually counteract the bad? Please say it is. Go on, say it. Never mind common sense. Just say it. Say it! SAY IT!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Tony Blair does appear to have positioned himself as a very particular kind of crisis management adviser. Anyone can lend a hand to virtuous sorts facing opprobrium. Only a few very skilled practitioners could, or would want to, assist those enduring the sting of national or international disapproval. We now know that he offered media strategy advice to Kazakh strongman Nursultan Nazarbayev when the autocrat faced international criticism over the killing of 15 civilian protesters by police. This is the tone to take, Blair said. He even crafted changes to the old brute's speech. But none should be surprised, for didn't Blair also lend his undoubted talents to Rebekah Brooks when News International faced public hostility for hacking Milly Dowler's mobile phone? Rebekah's no Nazarbayev, but there's a trend taking shape of Blair - the Red Adair of spin - dashing to the rescue when others won't. Friend to the friendless, that's him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;And as a result, others - seeing the former PM traduced - will jump to his defence. Loaded magazine reports on the latest to resist the attacks on Blair's reputation. &quot;Some folk thought it was crass of Tony to put on a celebration while acting as Middle East peace envoy. Some say he should be doing more to save the lives of those poor families in Israel and Palestine. But surely he's entitled to have a night off from his responsibilities to celebrate his wife's 60th birthday? I wouldn't care for his job - not for all the tea in China, thank you. But someone has to do it.&quot; So says Bobby Davro - comedian, impressionist, once a big beast in the world of entertainment. He seems to understand what Blair's job is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;An eye-opener when a man accustomed to shaping the news becomes news himself. This is the lot of Jeremy Paxman, who effortlessly segued from Newsnight to his one-man Edinburgh show. There were write-ups of that, mostly favourable, and more recently a rash of column inches about what he's doing next. He's talking to Channel 4, said an excitable series of headlines: negotiations are under way. And this might be right. But it might also be the maximum level of hype to be wrung from a single unsolicited phone call. Still, Jeremy won't be unduly aggrieved. He can look out for himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;With Ebola on the front pages, time to reflect on the context provided by Rick Wiles, the hardline evangelical and US talk show host. He sees the horror inflicted by Ebola, but, ever the optimist, Rick sees an upside. &quot;This Ebola epidemic could become a global pandemic and that's another name for plague,&quot; he said. &quot;It may be the great attitude adjustment that I believe is coming. Ebola could solve America's problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography and abortion.&quot; So, not all bad, says Rick. America must feel lucky to have him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Meanwhile, Fred Jarvis, the former teachers' union boss, hits the grand age of 90, and a good 90 it is by all accounts. Battle-hardened, unapologetic, unafraid. Invitations to his birthday party next month carry a motif in the corner saying: &quot;Gove is gone but I'm still here.&quot; The one-time general secretary of the National Union of Teachers detailed his multiple objections to Gove in his recent autobiography. &quot;I do not want to get off the education bus, even if it is in danger of being driven over the cliff by an obsessed ideologue,&quot; he said. At the time of writing, he wasn't to know that Gove was about to be satisfyingly humiliated and forced from the Department for Education. Still, he may have had an inkling. Jarvis's memoir is called You Never Know Your Luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Finally, after that prolonged period in 2012 spent denying and then apologising over the use of foul and racially abusive language against Anton Ferdinand, Chelsea's John Terry finds a new role. He's helping the club's Spanish acquisition Diego Costa to integrate. &quot;I am trying to teach him some words in English,&quot; Terry told the Times yesterday. He didn't list those words and they didn't ask. But he'll soon have the boy up to speed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has sent protective equipment for medical staff to the Democratic Republic of the Congo after it became the fifth African country this year to suffer a deadly outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ministry of health has declared an outbreak and we are treating it as such,&quot; Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, told Reuters in Geneva yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo declared on Sunday that Ebola had been identified in its northern Equateur province after two patients tested positive for the virus, but the health minister, Felix Kabange Numbi, denied any link to the epidemic raging in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials believe Ebola has killed 13 other people in the region, including five health workers. Kabange said 11 were ill and in isolation and 80 contacts were being traced, and the Djera area would be placed under quarantine. Djera is about 750 miles (1,200km) from Congo's capital, Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has swept through Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, resulting in 1,427 deaths and 2,615 infections since March. But Kabange said the Congolese epidemic &quot;has nothing to do with the one in west Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the two cases that tested positive was for the Sudanese strain of the virus, he explained, while the other was a mixture of the Sudanese and the Zaire strain - the most dangerous. The virus in west Africa is the Zaire strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola river in Congo and this is the seventh outbreak since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberian doctor treated with an experimental Ebola drug, ZMapp, died late on Sunday, the country's information minister said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at Liberia's largest hospital, had received the untested drug after it was given to two American health workers, who survived after receiving medical care in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Spanish missionary also received the treatment but died. Two health workers are still in treatment, and there were &quot;signs of hope&quot;, said Kabange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan has said it is ready to offer another experimental drug developed by a Japanese company to help stop the epidemic. Avigan was approved as an anti-influenza drug in Japan in March, and its developer Fujifilm Holdings said it had received inquiries about its use against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our country is prepared to provide the yet-to-be approved drug in cooperation with the manufacturer if the WHO requests,&quot; said chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga. David Smith</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley, the British nurse flown back to London after contracting Ebola, spoke of his joy at seeing patients recover from the deadly virus after treatment at the hospital in Sierra Leone where he was volunteering, just days before he fell ill himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old, from the village of Eyke in Suffolk, was said yesterday by his family to be receiving &quot;excellent care&quot; at a specialist unit at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, after being evacuated on an RAF plane on Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a poignant interview with the Guardian at the Kenema government hospital 10 days ago, a smiling Pooley said: &quot;It's great seeing them (the patients) walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state and seeing them on the wards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley, who registered as a nurse in February last year after completing his training, spent five weeks working at the Ebola centre before falling ill. Despite the lack of resources at the hospital, and some staff having fled for fear of contracting Ebola themselves, Pooley and others managed to help a growing number of people recover from the virus, for which there is no proven cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Free provided no update on Pooley's condition yesterday, having said that it would only do so in the event of a significant change. The Department of Health said on Sunday that he was &quot;not currently seriously unwell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Pooley's family said: &quot;We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK. We have been astounded by the speed and way in which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They thanked people for their good wishes and asked them &quot;to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Pooley was being treated with intravenous fluids and body salts in a specially designed tent with a controlled ventilation system yesterday, colleagues who worked alongside him in Sierra Leone praised his selflessness and determination to make a difference despite the risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He flew out to Sierra Leone earlier this year, initially intending to volunteer for six months at a hospice mainly providing care for people with cancer or Aids in the capital, Freetown. During his time at the Shepherd's hospice he wrote emails back to his mother, Jackie, in which he told of the poverty he had encountered and of learning about the horrors of the country's civil war from the people there, who he found &quot;friendly, funny and hospitable&quot;. Describing the local environment, he wrote: &quot;The houses are all mud-sand and palm thatch, the water is from one communal well and, of course, there is no electricity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left the hospice to help people with Ebola in Kenema, the centre of the outbreak, having become concerned that other healthcare workers were abandoning them. Gabriel Madiye, the hospice's executive director, told the BBC: &quot;We consider him a hero,&quot; and described him as &quot;somebody who is sacrificing to provide care in very difficult circumstances - when our own health workers are running away&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Oliver Johnson, who has been treating patients in Freetown, said his friend Pooley was a professional and dedicated nurse who &quot;absolutely understood that there were risks involved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: &quot;Will's a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave and really from the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could - not just help patients, but I think he had enormous loyalty towards the other staff at Kenema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people, many of them healthcare workers who have treated patients with the virus, which has spread from Guinea, where it originated in March, to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With treatment of the symptoms, which can take weeks or even months, survival is possible. While being treated, Pooley, who was taken under police escort to the Royal Free on Sunday, will be separated from medical staff by plastic and rubber sheets that ensure the virus does not spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health has stressed that the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low. Professor David Heymann, the director of the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security, said Pooley's chances of survival depended on a range of factors including his fitness and how well his body produces antibodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unknown whether he will be given the experimental drug ZMapp, which was used to treat two US aid workers who subsequently recovered. The Department of Health is believed to be trying to obtain supplies of the drug, but the manufacturers have said their stocks have been exhausted. Despite its apparently working on the US aid workers, its use has not been a complete success. It emerged yesterday that a Liberian doctor who received ZMapp died on Sunday. A Spanish missionary priest infected with Ebola also received the treatment and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Mutten, a member of Eyke parish council, where Pooley's mother is a clerk, said everyone in the local community was hoping he would fight off the disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation puts the number of people infected in the latest outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which has been sweeping through parts of western Africa since March, at 2,615, of whom 1,427 victims have died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But public health officials have stressed there is little or no risk to the general public in the UK, even after the arrival in London this weekend of a British medic infected with the virus while treating patients in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because, although Ebola has a very high mortality rate and no treatment or vaccine has so far been licensed for it, the virus is actually much less contagious than many other more common diseases, and good infection-control practices should effectively stop its spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is certainly deadly. Many of those infected with it are likely to die; around 56% in the current outbreak, and 67% across all outbreaks since the disease's discovery in 1976. But unlike, say, measles, diphtheria or whooping cough, which are airborne and can be caught simply by breathing, Ebola is quite hard to contract; like HIV or hepatitis, it is transmitted through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of an infected person or animal, either through actual physical contact or via infected objects such as needles or clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strict medical infection control is, therefore, the best answer for preventing the disease's spread - and it is mainly the lack of such strict control in the countries most affected by the recent outbreak (Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria) that is responsible for its severity. In countries with high standards of public healthcare, the risk of transmission is generally considered minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical director of the NHS could not have been much clearer this weekend following the arrival from Sierra Leone of a 29-year-old British healthcare worker, William Pooley, who tested positive for the Ebola virus last week and will now be treated in a special isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have prepared rigorous plans for this type of situation,&quot; said Professor Sir Bruce Keogh. &quot;This individual will pose no risk to the public, and only the tiniest risk to those who those who come into direct contact with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Peter Piot, the Belgian scientist who helped discover the Ebola virus, has even said he &quot;wouldn't be worried to sit next to someone with Ebola virus on the tube - as long as they don't vomit on you or something. This is an infection that requires very close contact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah. Right. Looks like I picked a bad week to draw inspiration from current affairs for this knockabout comedy column. The news is rarely a warehouse of carefree chuckles but at the moment it's like an apocalyptic playlist on perpetual shuffle, with one harrowing crisis overlapping another. Palestine, Libya, Syria . . . it's all horrifying and upsetting. Not a single nice thing has happened all year, except the recent stealth launch of Cadbury's Wispa Biscuits, and even &quot;stealth launch of Wispa Biscuits&quot; sounds like a terrible euphemism for breaking wind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planet is currently playing host to countless alarming crises. There's the nail-biting tension of Russia v Ukraine, a depressing standoff overseen by facial-expression-avoider Vladimir Putin. I don't know if all the strings connecting Putin's face muscles to his brain were accidentally severed during a tragic smiling accident years ago, but I've seen brickwork convey more emotion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of a new cold war is serious, but currently overshadowed by the next item on the playlist: Isis. Or Islamic State, a group that's risen from obscurity to become planet Earth's number one Band of Bogeymen; putting the &quot;hate&quot; into &quot;caliphate&quot;. We hear a lot about Isis seeking to establish a medieval-style Islamic state, which might not seem so frightening if the accent was on reviving the tolerance, harmony, and cultural and scientific advancements of a medieval Islamic state like Al-Andalus, rather than the more barbaric aspects of global medieval history that still prompt winces even when depicted in woodcut form or on tapestries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of young Brits apparently flocking to join Isis has prompted much public soul-searching. &quot;Why are young Muslims angry and disillusioned?&quot; asks the same media that habitually considers hysterical fabrications about Muslims demanding Halal bingo, or whatever, more important than factual reports about Palestinian children being blown to pieces. &quot;What kind of sick glorification are these jihadists seeking?&quot; they wail, while filling the front page with ominous images of &quot;Beatle John&quot; - literally a rock-star nickname - accompanied by text breathlessly recounting his terrifying ruthlessness. &quot;When will the Muslim community do something about this?&quot; they demand, without pausing to consider any potential accountability of their own. The media isn't to blame, but it does very little to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Johnson reckons the best way to thwart potential jihadists is for suspected terrorists to be assumed guilty until proven innocent. He described this as a &quot;swift and minor change&quot; to the law. Yep, just a quick, simple reversal of the entire basis of the British legal system. Making pre-emptive kneejerk assumptions is fun: in fact, I've already decided Boris Johnson is the shittest and most dangerous prime minister Britain's ever had, just to be ahead of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, just as you're coming to terms with Isis, along comes Ebola to get under your skin, literally. If you haven't heard of Ebola, you're living in a bubble. Like anyone who's been exposed to it. It's landed in the UK, but don't worry: apparently you can only catch the disease by existing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a measure of how bleak the news has become that the only showbiz story with any real traction is the one involving historical allegations against Sir Cliff Richard (allegations he denies). At the time of writing, Cliff hasn't been charged or found guilty of anything, except on the internet, where he's already serving concurrent 140-character sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, that's not the only showbiz tale. There's the ice bucket challenge, 2014's Gangnam Style, which is sort of uplifting, in that it involves famous people doing something stupid for charity. The idea is to raise awareness of motor neurone disease by tipping a bucket of iced water over your head and uploading the results to YouTube (having dried the video off first so it doesn't short-circuit the internet). Already popular, it went super-viral once celebrities joined in. David Beckham, Rihanna, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini - there were even sexy people too, like Alex Salmond. And Alistair Darling. Of course those two scarcely noticed the ice cold deluge because THEY ARE SCOTTISH AND THAT IS SCOTTISH WEATHER HAHA SCOTLAND.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone's done it. Simon Cowell, Kate Moss, Liam Gallagher, Dennis Nilsen. Former president and Teddy-Ruxpin-faced planet-vandal George W Bush joined in the fun, proving that even dot-eyed locust warmongers appreciate a bit of slapstick. Bush had an ice bucket emptied over his head by wife Laura. He's cheerfully commanded people to use buckets of water before, of course, but back then he called it &quot;waterboarding&quot;. Over three million people have watched his stunt on YouTube, although two million of those stumbled across it accidentally after typing &quot;dripping wet bush&quot; into the search engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, all things considered, 2014 is going to have to strain really hard to engineer some pleasant news before the end of December if things are going to balance out. That IS how the universe works, right? Good things eventually counteract the bad? Please say it is. Go on, say it. Never mind common sense. Just say it. Say it! SAY IT!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley, the first British person to contract the Ebola virus, has been given the experimental drug ZMapp as part of his intensive care treatment, the London hospital looking after him said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley, a 29-year-old nurse from Eyke in Suffolk, was flown back to the UK by the RAF on Sunday after contracting Ebola while volunteering at a treatment centre for people with the deadly virus in Kenema, Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infectious diseases at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, where Pooley is being treated, described him as a &quot;resilient and remarkable young man&quot;, who &quot;couldn't be in a better place today given where he is with the illness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference at the hospital, he said: &quot;We had the opportunity to give him the ZMapp treatment.&quot; He said that it was &quot;too early to say how he's managing or doing&quot; but Pooley had not had any side effects. Pooley was given his first dose on Monday and will be given further doses over the next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two US aid workers recovered from the Ebola virus after being treated with ZMapp, but a Liberian doctor who received the drug died on Sunday. A Spanish missionary treated with ZMapp also died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manufacturers said high demand meant that it had no remaining stock but Jacobs said the team treating Pooley had sourced it through its clinical networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs said Pooley's prognosis would be clearer in a week's time, warning that the course of the illness over the next few days would be very hard to predict and it would be a critical period for him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Medicare Insurance Corporation has presented a cheque of US$1,000 to the National Task Force in the fight against Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the cheque on behalf of his Corporation, the Managing Director, Michael Bull, said the initial donation is to assist those who are affected by the epidemic be provided food and care and hope that with the care provided there will be some level of improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bull said the Corporation's donation is to cherish the work done so far as there are more survivors of the disease that had plagued the nation as the stories are beginning to change due to sensitization and it is their prayer that in the next few months all of Liberia's stories will be of successes on how Ebola was kicked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the cheque, a proxy of the Task Force said it is welcoming news that a Liberian business can step forward to assist the Task Force and promised to deposit it into the special account at the Central Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Ministry of Finance is also expected to give up-dates making public the names of those who made donations to the effort so that at the end of the day, those who provided assistance to this fight can be comfortable that their donations were appreciated and would be spent for the purpose intended with accountability.</SPAN></P>
