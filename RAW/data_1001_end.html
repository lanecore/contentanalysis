</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">528 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia (GOL) has frowned on the current isolation of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone due to the outbreak of the Ebola virus in these three countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOL said this isolation and abandonment by other African countries not affected by the Ebola virus is unacceptable and un-African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's Information Minister Lewis G. Brown said to isolate the three countries is not the right thing to do because these countries did not request for the Ebola virus in their respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown stressed that Government of Liberia is concerned about the level of isolation and abandonment by some African countries affected by the Ebola virus contrary to expert opinion that &quot;isolation is not the right thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the regular Ebola news briefing at the Information Ministry yesterday, Minister Brown said it is not a right thing when sisterly African countries can say airlines or ships coming into Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea should avoid their various sea and airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia Information Minister noted that the behavior on the part of these African countries violates the spirit of Africa's unity and solidarity which every country on the continent subscribed to, saying, &quot;This is un-African and violates the spirit of African solidarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown pointed out that this is the time that Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone need the assistance of these African countries, asking, &quot; How can you say ships coming into Liberia should not dock into your port and crew of airlines coming into Liberia should not sleep in your respective countries?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lewis Brown said this is time for African countries to put together and fight a common cause such as the fight against the deadly Ebola virus and not be apart because the virus is not affecting another but is killing Africans in an affected country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have put in place stringent measures to fight this scourge and we are working to stop the spread of the virus but this step of isolation and abandonment is counter-productive to our peace, security and stability,&quot; he intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Boss wondered how essential materials needed to fight the Ebola virus come into these countries when all the airlines are closing down and certain countries do not warn against ships coming into affected countries not to use their various ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Minister Brown told Liberians that the country will pass through this problem and triumph at the end saying, &quot;When they said no black can govern themselves, we did here in Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) and other international humanitarian organizations have warned against sanctioning Ebola affected countries but countries like Ivory Coast, Kenya and others have already sanctioned travel of individuals from Ebola affected countries to their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development Minister Brown yesterday disclosed that four of those involved in the recent looting of the Ebola Holding Center in West Point have begun showing symptoms of the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they have been further quarantined to stop the spread of the disease in the densely populated Township of West Point ; reports Timothy T.Seaklon</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY BEN SPENCER, CLAIRE ELLICOTT, FRANCESCA INFANTE AND NICK FAGGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NURSE is fighting for his life in hospital after becoming the first British victim of the ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London late last night after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the grave dangers, he had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was described as a remarkable young man' and a natural leader by an American scientist who worked at the same hospital in Kenema. He had taken on a very big role,' said Robert F Garry, a professor in microbiology at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tulane University in New Orleans. We've lost several other nurses including the head nurse who lost her battle against ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was very well liked by all the nurses and had taken on a pivotal role. Some people are just marked out as leaders and he led the nurses. He was a very hard worker and they looked up to him.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley last night arrived back to London in an isolation sack for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Madiye, Mr Pooley's boss at another Sierra Leone clinic, said: Will wanted to go to Kenema and help the patients at the hospital there. I told him not to go, but Will said he felt a very strong responsibility to the patients there as they were being abandoned by doctors and nurses who were fearful of contracting the ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told him he would not be able to withstand the disease but he said he had to go.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Madiye said Mr Pooley, from Woodbridge, Suffolk, had been volunteering at the ebola centre in Kenema for just five weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously he had been providing palliative care to patients at the Shepherd's Hospice in Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, and had been there since March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were fleeing for fear of catching the disease, he decided to go to the badly-affected region of Kenema, Mr Madiye said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been calling him for updates and he said he was fine, but for the past five days I have tried to ring him and he hasn't called back,' said Mr Madiye, who is the executive director of the Shepherd's Hospice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, he said he was being evacuated to Britain. He sounded positive and said he would be fine in a couple of weeks and would call me then. He said the British doctors would save him.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley's doctors are said to be confident that, with urgent medical attention, he has a good chance of fighting the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the NHS started a global hunt for remaining supplies of the only treatment thought to combat the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMapp, an untested drug only ever used on a handful of patients, has shown promising results, apparently aiding the recovery of two US missionaries who contracted the virus. But Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the American company behind it, says stocks are exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source at the Department of Health said: We are working with our international partners to source remaining doses for the patient.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials last night said Mr Pooley was not seriously unwell' - a factor which will significantly boost his chance of survival. Most patients die of ebola because of dehydration, when their blood vessels break down and their major organs fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fit, young patients who are given quick treatment have a vastly improved chance of survival. If they are hydrated and the bleeding controlled, their immune systems can in some cases kick in, and defeat the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has put the number of people infected with the deadly virus at 2,615 and declared the crisis to be a global health emergency'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1,427 have died since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Last night two people were reported to have died of ebola in the Congo, in what is thought to be a new outbreak. Around 300 have become infected in Kenema, the district where Mr Pooley was working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation approved ZMapp for use two weeks ago, an extraordinary decision given that the drug had not been widely tested. It was used to treat Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly, who have since been discharged from hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">560 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEDICS told yesterday of the stressful and desperate conditions in the makeshift ebola wards where the British victim worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff were too scared to come to work at Kenema government hospital where the floors were left splashed with blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 350-bed hospital is a cluster of small cinder-block buildings in the centre of Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and a hot-spot for ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation units where the afflicted are taken are in temporary covered shelters with concrete floors, plastic sheeting for walls and tin roofs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors and nurses wear masks, goggles and impermeable Tyvek safety suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, 20 nurses and healthcare workers have died of ebola since the outbreak began. Loss of concentration brought on by the gruelling workload is blamed for them exposing themselves to the deadly virus. Daniel Bausch, an American doctor and ebola expert who was at the hospital last month, said in one ward of 30 patients the floor was splashed with blood, vomit, faeces and urine'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola sufferers often fall out of bed, he said, creating a decontamination nightmare for medics, who would also have to haul the patients back into bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also staff shortages because nurses walked out after not receiving their &pound;20 a week hazard pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One nurse who continued working, Sister Nancy Yoko, 36, said: No one wants to come close to us, the nurses in the general ward won't talk to us, even our families are scared they will catch the virus from us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is new to Sierra Leone and there is much suspicion and mistrust about the hospital. There was even a rumour that locals wanted to burn down the Kenema site, which is in Sierra Leone's Eastern Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are angry with us, they don't believe we are trying to help,' said another nurse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Garry, an American professor of microbiology and immunology who has visited the hospital many times, said conditions were getting better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the nurses' decision to strike, he said: It's not really surprising that some people made the judgement it's not worth their personal risk - no one could fault anyone for doing that. Some have set aside their own personal wellbeing and paid the ultimate price. We only wish the best for this young British nurse who put it all on the line.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Garry said the hospital was a decent multi-purpose facility by African standards but with not enough doctors, not enough nurses and not a whole lot of modern equipment'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: Working in the ebola wards is very stressful. You are dealing with patients that are carrying a very dangerous virus - one mistake and you'll become infected yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are working long days, up to 18 hours, day after day, as no doubt this young British nurse did, you are more likely to make a mistake. Humans can only maintain that kind of intense concentration for so long.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleagues who have returned from Kenema recently told him conditions were improving with more cleaners to do decontamination work. The hospital deals with 90 ebola cases a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A risk assessment published last month by Public Health England said the current outbreak could raise the danger for Britons working in humanitarian and healthcare delivery in affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the threat to tourists, visitors and expatriates was still considered very low if elementary precautions are followed'.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Pooley will be kept behind plastic sheeting for weeks, if not months, to stop the spread of ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the 29-year-old nurse was put into an air transit isolator, a clear plastic sack, to stop the virus escaping into the RAF C-17 transport plane that flew him home from Freetown, Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On board was a team of British specialists who conducted a full clinical examination before confirming he was safe to fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond gave the final approval for the repatriation before the transporter took off at 1.50pm UK time.Ebola is an extremely infectious virus, spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plastic sheeting that will shroud Mr Pooley's body for weeks will protect health workers and other patients from catching the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the flight the doctors were covered in head-to-toe protective suits - the same uniform will be worn by everyone Mr Pooley sees over the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On landing at RAF Northolt last night the volunteer nurse - still inside his plastic bubble - was loaded into an ambulance and driven to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, he was admitted through a specially-assigned hospital entrance, before being taken to the hospital's high-level isolation unit - the only ward in the UK equipped to cope with ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will occupy a &pound;25,000 bed that will be burned after he leaves the hospital. The bed will sit inside an isolation tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only seven doctors and a handful of nurses will be allowed to enter the room. Mr Pooley's treatment will focus on replacing the fluid he loses through internal bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into his body to try to stop his organs failing. The doctors will also treat the bleeding from his nose, eyes and ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they cannot get hold of the experimental ebola drug ZMapp, the doctors will simply try to manage the disease until Mr Pooley's immune system is strong enough to fight it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A filtration system will suck the air away, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building. The air will also be kept under negative pressure to stop any escaping from the tent. Human waste will be collected in a secure container similar to a pressure cooker before it is decontaminated and disposed of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Mepham, one of the senior doctors at the unit, said earlier this month: The reason behind the unit is to protect healthcare workers from highly contagious infections such as ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything is contained within the tent under negative pressure so the air is constantly added and removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the tent, the air flows through a series of filters and is deposited outside the hospital.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard, when confronted with pictures and reports detailing the Ebola outbreak in Africa, not to shake one's head in pity. What medical facilities there are, we hear, are overwhelmed by the scale of it. So it is extraordinary to learn that Liberians dying of Ebola have better access to groundbreaking, potentially life-saving new treatments than do people dying of cancer here in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola treatment in question is ZMapp, an experimental serum which has not been tested on humans in medical trials, but was none the less given to two American doctors - Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol - who were infected while working in Liberia. Both have now made a full recovery. Three infected African medics who have received ZMapp in Liberia are also reportedly doing well. Now a British doctor, infected with Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, is to be returned to this country for treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason that such patients are able to receive ZMapp is because an ethics panel at the World Health Organisation has decided that, given the magnitude of the Ebola outbreak, a departure from standard evidence-based treatments is justified. Potential treatments that have shown promising results in the laboratory but have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy in humans are, in certain conditions, now acceptable on both ethical and evidential grounds, the WHO says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few doubt that the gravity of this outbreak of Ebola, which has killed about 1,500 so far, requires a response by all means necessary. Yet in Britain today the toll of another disease - cancer - is 100 times higher, and access to such experimental treatments is not available, even for those desperate patients beyond the help of current medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 150,000 British citizens will die from cancer this year, making it the number one cause of untimely death. And while the disease may have a different name, our response should be the same as with Ebola - doctors should be encouraged to try new treatments, and be protected when they do so. Importantly, the Medical Innovation Bill, now before Parliament, will allow doctors and their patients in Britain to try treatments that have not been tested or fully trialled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inevitably, there are objections that the Bill's restrictions and conditions placed on doctors are too lax - that they can play fast and loose with vulnerable, dying patients. So it's worth looking at the conditions imposed by the WHO on ZMapp to see how they compare with the conditions set in the Medical Innovation Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First: lethality. On Ebola, the WHO panel agreed that the threat posed by Ebola, with its &quot;high case-fatality rate&quot; was sufficient to warrant the use of experimental therapies. The Medical Innovation Bill is explicitly designed to achieve the very same result. This is why the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said about the Bill that &quot;the Government should do whatever is needed to remove barriers that prevent innovation which can save and improve lives. We must create a climate where clinical pioneers have the freedom to make breakthroughs in treatment.&quot; The Secretary of State wisely asked Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of the NHS, to devise the legislative safeguards to be included in the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, ethics: the WHO rightly sets a high ethical standard for use of ZMapp, including &quot;transparency about all aspects of care, informed consent, freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community&quot;. The Bill echoes this ethical standard, requiring informed consent of the patient, or the patient's representative, and full transparency. Indeed, the Bill goes further than the WHO guidelines, stating that in order to depart from the existing range of accepted medical treatments, a doctor must also obtain the views of at least one other relevantly qualified doctor, carry out a full risk assessment, and obtain any other consents required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, of course, while the WHO offers guidelines, the Medical Innovation Bill is backed by the full force of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, WHO guidance requires that all data generated by the use of ZMapp should be collected and shared. If scientific progress is to be made through such experimental use of untested treatments, results must be available to the scientific community. The Bill will secure this. The University of Oxford has offered to create a database to register innovative medical interventions under the Bill and to collect and share the data from them, so that they may inform and inspire clinical trials. As Sir John Bell, Regis Professor of Medicine at Oxford, said: &quot;There will be no cure for cancer until real doctors with real patients in real hospitals are allowed to innovate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So those of us who have cheered the use of an untested drug to help apparently hopeless cases in Liberia should cheer the Medical Innovation Bill. It will help medical science progress, aid researchers in their hunt for cures for fatal diseases - and offer hope to the 300,000 Britons who will be diagnosed with cancer this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOCTORS have begun a race against time to secure dwindling supplies of experimental drugs to treat the British health care worker with Ebola who was flown home from Sierra Leone yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man, who was treating patients with the disease, was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in north London, which has a dedicated isolation unit for people with contagious deadly diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The patient, known as William, was exposed to Ebola a week ago and became unwell two or three days ago, officials said. William was flown back late last night and doctors insist he poses little to no risk to the public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last night it was unclear exactly how UK medics would attempt to treat the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no cure for Ebola and the only drug ever successfully used to treat it is ZMapp. Two American charity workers who contracted the disease were given the drug and have recovered and been discharged from hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that supplies of ZMapp have run out. Doctors in the UK are trying to source experimental drugs, some of which have never been tested on humans, in an attempt to treat the man. There are other drugs under development which have not been through proper clinical trials, but supplies of them are limited, the WHO has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the Department of Health said: &quot;Efforts are being made to facilitate use of experimental therapies for this patient, but any decision to use them will only be made with the clinicians and the patient themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMapp is a monoclonal antibody which takes several months to manufacture from genetically modified tobacco plants. Another drug, an antiviral, is also under development along with several vaccines, but they will not be ready for testing until next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night public health experts insisted the man's return to the UK would pose no risk to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One senior doctor said he would happily take his family to the hospital treating the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Precautions were being taken to ensure the safety of doctors, nurses and Royal Air Force personnel transporting the British patient to the UK last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The patient was put into a sealed &quot;air transport isolator&quot; unit in hospital in Sierra Leone, which was loaded on to a specially equipped C17 Royal Air Force aircraft to RAF Northolt, north west London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once it had landed the whole unit was loaded on to a special RAF ambulance which was driven directly into the Royal Free Hospital's isolation department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At no point was the patient outside the isolation unit and all staff looking after him wore protective suits, including full face masks, gloves and hats. They will have reached into the isolator through sealed tubes to treat the patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the Department of Health said: &quot;The UK has well established infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission while the patient is in transit and receiving treatment at the Royal Free Hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Bob Winter, national clinical director for emergency preparedness and critical care for NHS England, told The Daily Telegraph that staff and patients at the Royal Free should not be worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would go and drink coffee in the Royal Free with my family. The risk has not changed. There is no need for the general public around the Royal Free to be concerned in any way. The virus is not airborne, it can only be contracted through direct contact with bodily fluids from a patient with the disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the team at the Royal Free would consider any experimental drugs available and decide with the patient whether to use them or rely on conventional supportive treatments such as fluids, antibiotics for secondary infections, oxygen and electrolytes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Winter said: &quot;NHS England, together with Public Health England, the Department of Health and other key stakeholders has been working hard over the past few weeks to ensure any patient who contracts Ebola and needs to be repatriated to the UK receives the best possible care and treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The NHS has a special unit at the Royal Free in London which is well prepared to receive this patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said: &quot;It is important to be reassured that although a case of Ebola in a British national health care worker residing in Sierra Leone has been identified and is being brought back to the UK, the overall risk to the public in the UK remains very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said: &quot;The patient is being transferred to the Royal Free Hospital for appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated by the Department of Health, PHE and NHS England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Protective measures will be strictly maintained to minimise the risk of transmission to staff transporting the patient to the UK and health care workers treating the individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday the WHO said one of its health care workers in Sierra Leone had tested positive for the disease and was receiving treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Hunter, professor of Health Protection at the Norwich School of Medicine, at the University of East Anglia, said: &quot;It is well known that health care workers are at particular risk from Ebola when caring for affected patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have a huge amount of respect for all those health care staff working in affected areas. Without their efforts many more people would die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disease has struck more than 2,400 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, killing almost half of them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH health care worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone was last night flown to London, where doctors battled to save his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old, believed to be a male nurse named William, caught the virus while caring for patients at a hospital where 15 nurses have already died of the disease. It is the first confirmed case of a Briton catching the virus in the recent outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colleagues of William said last night he had begged to be allowed to work with Ebola patients, despite being warned about the risk of infection. He is said to have volunteered after local doctors fled from the hospital. The Briton told friends it was his calling to help those afflicted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William was flown home to RAF Northolt and taken to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead in a plastic isolation tent. He will be treated in the only isolation unit in Britain designed to deal with contagious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it was unclear how doctors planned to treat him after it was disclosed that supplies have run out of the experimental drug that has been used to treat Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health said the male nurse was not &quot;seriously unwell&quot;. However, patients have been known to deteriorate quickly after appearing well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health experts said the risk to the public from the virus was &quot;very low&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends spoke in glowing terms about William, who is believed to have been in Sierra Leone for six months. A colleague in the West African country, where William had worked for five months, spoke to his friend as he was waiting to fly back to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Will said he was feeling very ill but he was quite positive about everything. He told me that he was sure the British doctors would cure him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colleague said William volunteered to work at the hospital as soon as the disease broke out about five weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said William stayed at the hospital even as fearful doctors deserted their patients. He administered medicine and helped to keep dying patients clean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak began, 392 people have died in Sierra Leone, with 910 con-firmed cases. The death rate for Ebola can be as high as 90 per cent, but during the current outbreak it is 57 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colleague said: &quot;When the Ebola outbreak occurred, Will begged me to allow him to go and work at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He told me he had a calling to go there. I advised him not to go. But he pleaded with me. He is very brave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William trained as a nurse in Britain before going to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government ministers decided on Saturday to fly William back to Britain. They decided there was &quot;no risk&quot; the repatriation would cause an outbreak in Britain. His hospital bed will be surrounded by a specially-designed tent with its own controlled ventilation system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waste is decontaminated and a dedicated laboratory will carry out tests. Air leaving the unit is cleaned to minimise the risk to anyone at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak began there have been 2,615 cases and 1,427 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. But it believes the magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are hiding infected friends and family in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said measures would be maintained to avoid the virus being transmitted to staff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH health care worker who tested positive for Ebola in Sierra Leone was last night flown to London, where doctors battled to save his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 29-year-old, believed to be a male nurse named William, caught the virus while caring for patients at a hospital where 15 nurses have already died of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the first confirmed case of a Briton catching the virus in the recent outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colleagues of William said last night he had begged to be allowed to work with Ebola patients, despite being warned about the risk of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is said to have volunteered after local doctors fled from the hospital. The Briton told friends it was his calling to help those afflicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William was flown home by the RAF and taken to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead in a plastic isolation tent. He will be treated in the only isolation unit in Britain designed to deal with contagious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it was unclear how doctors planned to treat him after it was disclosed that supplies have run out of the experimental drug that has been used to treat Ebola patients. The Department of Health said the male nurse was not &quot;seriously unwell&quot;. However, patients have been known to deteriorate quickly despite previously appearing well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public health experts insisted that the risk to the public from the virus was &quot;very low&quot; despite the first arrival of a confirmed case on UK soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friends spoke in glowing terms about William, who is believed to have been in Sierra Leone for six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A colleague in the West African country, where William had worked for five months, spoke to his friend as he was waiting to fly back to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;Will said he was feeling very ill but he was quite positive about every-thing. He was feeling very unwell but he told me that he was sure the British doctors would be able to cure him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The colleague said William volunteered to work at the hospital as soon as the disease broke out about five weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said William stayed at the hospital even as fearful doctors deserted their patients. He administered medicine and helped to keep dying patients comfortable and clean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the outbreak began, 392 people have died in Sierra Leone, with 910 confirmed cases. The death rate for Ebola can be as high as 90 per cent, but during the current outbreak it is 57 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The colleague said: &quot;When the Ebola outbreak occurred, Will begged me to allow him to go and work at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He told me he had a calling to go there. I advised him not to go. But he pleaded with me. He is very brave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William trained as a nurse in Britain before leaving for Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking previously about his decision to travel to Africa, he said: &quot;It's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference. I'm not particularly experienced or skilled, but I can do the job and I am actually helping.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government ministers decided on Saturday to fly William back to Britain. They decided there was &quot;no risk&quot; the repatriation would cause an outbreak in Britain. His hospital bed will be surrounded by a specially-designed tent with its own controlled ventilation system. Only speciallytrained medical staff will be allowed inside the unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waste is decontaminated and a dedicated laboratory will carry out tests. Air leaving the unit is cleaned to minimise the risk to anyone at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the outbreak began there have been 2,615 cases and 1,427 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. But it believes the magnitude of the outbreak has been underestimated because people are hiding infected friends and family in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection at Public Health England, said measures would be maintained to avoid the virus being transmitted to staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;For Ebola to be transmitted contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and as such, the risk to the general population remains very low.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healthcare worker who is the first Briton confirmed to have tested positive for the Ebola virus was flown to London yesterday for treatment after being evacuated from Sierra Leone on an RAF plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health said he was &quot;not currently seriously unwell&quot; in a statement issued shortly after the C-17 aircraft took off from Freetown-Lungi airport for RAF Northolt in west London where it landed at 9pm. The man was taken to the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, London, which has an isolation unit where he can be treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who lives in Sierra Leone, had been volunteering at an Ebola clinic in the Kenema district in the east of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people who have died from the virus has been put by the World Health Organisation at 1,427 out of 2,615 inflected since the disease was identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to fly the British man home was taken on Saturday at a meeting between the medical director of the NHS, Sir Bruce Keogh, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond. A medical assessment was carried out to see whether the patient was fit to fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof John Watson, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said the risk to the public remained low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Paul Cosford, the director for health protection at Public Health England, said protective measures would be maintained to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and, as such, the risk to the general population remains very low,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Freetown-Lungi airport, an official said: &quot;I saw it (the plane) sitting there for more than one hour before it took off. Some doctors assisted the man on board&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Bob Winter, national clinical director for emergency preparedness and critical care for NHS England, said preparations had been made over the past few weeks to ensure any patient being repatriated to the UK received the best possible care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital has specialist equipment to help contain the infection. The bed is surrounded by a specially designed tent with a controlled ventilation system and a specific hospital entrance is used for transit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waste is decontaminated and there is a dedicated laboratory to carry out tests. All the air leaving the unit is cleaned to minimise the risk to anyone at the hospital, the Royal Free said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Dannatt, founder of the British charity Street Child which works in Sierra Leone and the Liberian township of West Point, said the spread of Ebola had spiralled from a health emergency into a humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said West Point was &quot;a tense, grim, impoverished slum at any time&quot; and was now barricaded. &quot;They are now totally cut off from the world with uncertain access to food and water - and a terrifying disease from which they do not fully understand how to protect themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Medecins sans Frontieres said the international community was paying &quot;almost zero&quot; interest to the growing health crisis. The first confirmed case of a British person contracting the virus comes after two US citizens were last week discharged from hospital after receiving experimental medications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries in west Africa face ever growing isolation in their attempts to combat Ebola, as Ivory Coast became the latest state to close its borders with affected countries and the Philippines withdrew peacekeepers from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast shut its border with Liberia after cases of the disease were reported on the border, and also with Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors in Freetown said patients were shunning hospitals because of the fear of catching Ebola, even though the city has had only 12 cases in a population of 1 million. Two large city hospitals in the capital were mostly empty yesterday, with few patients to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets of Freetown are quieter than usual and people have been avoiding large crowds. The WHO has sent 400 people to help fight the epidemic and yesterday revealed that one of its experts had contracted the disease in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Freetown airport, passengers arriving and departing have to wash their hands twice, have their temperature taken and fill in a form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued updated travel advice last week which urged people to carefully assess their need to travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;General medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are currently under severe strain due to the Ebola outbreak and unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Dedicated healthcare facilities for Ebola are overwhelmed,&quot; the FCO warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health minister says up to 15 people may have died but virus is not linked to epidemic that has spread through west Africa</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has sent protective equipment for medical staff to the Democratic Republic of the Congo after it became the fifth African country this year to suffer a deadly outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ministry of health has declared an outbreak and we are treating it as such,&quot; Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, told Reuters in Geneva on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo declared on Sunday that Ebola had struck in its northern Equateur province after two of eight patients tested for the virus were found positive, but health minister Felix Kabange Numbi denied any link to the epidemic raging in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congolese officials believe Ebola has killed 13 other people in the region, including five health workers. Kabange said 11 people were ill and in isolation and that 80 contacts were being traced, while Djera would be placed under quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congo cases follow the outbreak which has swept through Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, resulting in 1,427 deaths and 2,615 infections since March. But Kabange said: &quot;This epidemic has nothing to do with the one in west Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the two cases that tested positive was for the Sudanese strain of the virus, he explained, while the other was a mixture between the Sudanese and the Zaire strain - the most lethal. The virus in west Africa is the Zaire strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not new to Congo, where the virus was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola river. In all there have been seven outbreaks, causing more than 760 deaths. &quot;The experience acquired during the six previous epidemics of Ebola will contribute to the containing of this illness,&quot; Kabange said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Djera is more than 1,200km(745 miles) from Congo's capital, Kinshasa, and more than 600km from the provincial capital, Mbandaka. M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res said it was sending a crew to help handle patients in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries in east and southern Africa have imposed travel restrictions to prevent Ebola reaching their shores while battling global perceptions that they are no longer safe for foreign tourists. South Africa has banned entry for non-citizens arriving from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is spread between humans through direct contact with infected body fluids. It is one of the world's deadliest diseases, with up to 90% of cases resulting in death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest-ever outbreak of Ebola was triggered by a toddler's chance contact with a single infected bat, a team of international researchers will reveal, after a major investigation of the origins of the deadly disease now ravaging Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of 17 European and African tropical disease researchers, ecologists and anthropologists spent three weeks talking to people and capturing bats and other animals near the village of Meliandoua in remote eastern Guinea, where the present epidemic appeared in December 2013. They have concluded that the disease was spread by colonies of migratory fruit bats. Their research is expected to be published in a major journal in the next few weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the research came as the first confirmed case of a Briton contracting the disease in Sierra Leone emerged last night. Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said the overall risk to the UK public remains &quot;very low&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early studies suggested that a new strain of Ebola had emerged in west Africa but according to epidemiologist Fabian Leendertz, a disease ecologist at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin who led the large team of scientists to Guinea, it is likely the virus in Guinea is closely related to the one known as Zaire ebolavirus, identified more than 10 years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Leendertz said the virus had probably arrived in west Africa via an infected straw-coloured fruit bat. These bats migrate across long distances and are commonly found in giant colonies near cities and in forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak has killed more than 1,300 people in west Africa so far. Within a week of the two-year-old boy catching the disease in Meliandoua, both he and his mother had died and it was spread to nearby communities and urban areas by mourners at a funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists have suspected for several years that bats are the wild &quot;reservoirs&quot; of Ebola, but direct transmission to humans is extremely rare, despite communities hunting the bats for food. Nearly all previous epidemics had been linked to the bushmeat trade, with hunters picking up dead infected animals and selling them on. Previous outbreaks saw catastrophic death rates in gorilla and chimpanzee populations, which led some scientists to think they may be responsible for the disease spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimps, gorillas, some antelopes and even pigs - which possibly eat fruit dropped by infected bats - have all been linked by the World Health Organisation to the spread of the disease, but the researchers now say no evidence has been found of other animals apart from bats being infected. Primatologists and conservationists in the region who were contacted by the Observer all confirmed that vulnerable chimpanzee colonies had so far escaped infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruit bats, however, are widely eaten in rural west Africa - either smoked, grilled or in a spicy soup. Leendertz said: &quot;We spent eight days in Meliandoua. They told us they regularly catch bats, like every other village in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The evidence is not 100% and we can only say that it is possible. There are huge colonies of bats which regularly migrate. They can travel far in one night. I don't think an individual bat or colony migrated all the way from Congo or Gabon to west Africa. These big colonies are connected. There is a possibility for the virus to mix between colonies. They (the bats) share the same fruit. It is likely not to have even been one species of bat. The virus may jump from one species to another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If bats are confirmed as the reservoir of the disease, forest communities could try to destroy their vast colonies. &quot;That would be an ecological disaster,&quot; said Leendertz, &quot;because bats pollinate plants and devour insects. And bat hunts would also only increase human contact with potentially infected animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall risk to UK public 'very low' says chief medical officer as west African nations impose stringent new measures</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British national living in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the Ebola virus - the first Briton confirmed to have contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health said medical experts were assessing the situation &quot;to ensure that appropriate care is delivered&quot;. Consular assistance is being provided.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said: &quot;The overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low. Medical experts are currently assessing the situation in Sierra Leone to ensure that appropriate care is provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, west African nations have imposed stringent new measures to stop the spread of Ebola as two new cases emerged in Nigeria that appear to indicate a widening of the circle of those affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ivory Coast has closed its borders with its Ebola-hit neighbours and Sierra Leone has said it will jail people who hide patients with the virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) believes the practice has contributed to a major underestimation of the current outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was announced on Saturday that the borders between Ivory Coast and both Guinea and Liberia had been closed the previous day as the death toll of the epidemic reached 1,427 across west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agence France-Presse reported that the measure was put in place &quot;to protect all people, including foreigners, living on Ivorian territory,&quot; Ivorian prime minister Daniel Kaban Duncan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the WHO, Liberia has been the hardest hit by the outbreak, with 624 deaths since March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea has seen 406 people die, while in Sierra Leone 392 have succumbed to the haemorrhagic fever. Nigeria, meanwhile, has seen five people die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two new cases in Nigeria are causing particular concern because they are outside the immediate group of caregivers who treated a dying airline passenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new patients were infected by their spouses, both medical workers who had direct contact with Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer, who flew into Nigeria from Liberia and Togo and infected 11 others before he died in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fears that the number of people affected is even higher than reported because many people - mindful of the stigma attached - are hiding Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This phenomenon strongly suggests the existence of an invisible caseload of patients who are not being detected by the surveillance system,&quot; the UN health agency said. This has &quot;never before been seen in an Ebola outbreak&quot;, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Associated Press, the Liberian government has delivered donated rice to a slum where 50,000 people have been sealed off from the rest of the capital Monrovia in an attempt to contain the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, a new amendment to the country's health act was passed, imposing jail time of up to two years for those caught hiding Ebola patients. The new law - an update to the country's 1960 Public Health Act - was passed on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmaker Ansumana Jaiah Kaikai said the measure was necessary to compel reluctant residents to cooperate with government officials. &quot;This amendment seeks to address these emerging bottlenecks,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healthcare worker who is the first Briton confirmed to have tested positive for the Ebola virus was flown to London on Sunday for treatment after being evacuated from Sierra Leone on an RAF plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health said he was &quot;not currently seriously unwell&quot; in a statement issued shortly after the C-17 aircraft took off from Freetown for RAF Northolt in west London where it landed at 9pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was expected to be taken to the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, London, which has an isolation unit where he can be treated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who lives in Sierra Leone, had been volunteering at an Ebola clinic in the Kenema district in the east of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people infected with the deadly virus has been put at 2,615 by the World Health Organisation. The disease was identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria - 1,427 victims have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to fly the British man home was taken on Saturday at a meeting between the medical director of the NHS, Sir Bruce Keogh, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond. A medical assessment was carried out to see whether the patient was fit to fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The patient is not currently seriously unwell and is being medically evacuated in a specially equipped C-17 Royal Air Force plane to RAF Northolt in the UK. Upon arrival in the UK, the patient will be transported to an isolation unit at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust,&quot; a statement from the Department of Health said on Sunday. Prof John Watson, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said the risk to the public remained low. &quot;We have robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases when they arise, supported by a wide range of experts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases and this patient will be isolated and will receive the best care possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Paul Cosford, the director for health protection at Public Health England, said protective measures will be maintained to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus. &quot;For Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed and, as such, the risk to the general population remains very low,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RAF flight took off from Freetown-Lungi airport. &quot;I saw it [the plane] sitting there for more than one hour before it took off. Some doctors assisted the man on board,&quot; an airport official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital has specialist equipment to help contain the infection. The bed is surrounded by a specially-designed tent with a controlled ventilation system and a specific hospital entrance is used for transit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waste is decontaminated and there is a dedicated laboratory to carry out tests. All the air leaving the unit is cleaned to minimise the risk to anyone at the hospital, the hospital said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Dannatt, founder of the British charity Street Child which works in Sierra Leone and West Point in Liberia, said the spread of Ebola had spiralled from a health emergency into a humanitarian disaster. He said the Liberian township of West Point was &quot;a tense, grim, impoverished slum at any time&quot; and is now barricaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are now totally cut off from the world with uncertain access to food and water - and a terrifying disease from which they do not fully understand how to protect themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res said the international community was paying &quot;almost zero&quot; interest to the growing health crisis. The first confirmed case of a British person contracting the virus comes after two US citizens were last week discharged from hospital after receiving experimental medications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries in west Africa face ever growing isolation in their attempts to combat Ebola, as Ivory Coast became the latest state to close its borders with affected countries and the Philippines withdrew peacekeepers from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast shut its border with Liberia after cases of the disease were reported on the border, and also with Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors in Freetown said patients are shunning hospitals because of the fear of catching Ebola, even though the city has had only 12 cases in a population of 1 million. Two large city hospitals in the capital were mostly empty on Sunday, with few patients to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets of Freetown are quieter than usual and people have been avoiding large crowds. The World Health Organisation has sent 400 people to help fight the epidemic and on Sunday revealed that one of its experts had contracted the disease in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Freetown airport passengers arriving and departing have to wash their hands twice, have their temperature taken and fill in a form.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH charity worker infected by the deadly ebola virus sweeping through West Africa is to be flown home in a desperate bid to save his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, the first Briton to contract the disease outside the laboratory, will be transported by the RAF from Sierra Leone, where 392 people are known to have died of the virus this year. The evacuation will take place today or tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to fly him back was taken yesterday after a top-level meeting during which Ministers concluded there was no risk' that the repatriation would trigger an outbreak in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military aircraft was last night being equipped with a specially designed isolation tent, and infectious diseases experts were on standby to oversee the emergency evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few details have emerged about the man's identity, but it is understood he is a medic working for a British charity on the front line of the battle against ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be flown into RAF Northolt near Heathrow in West London then driven across the capital by London Ambulance Service to North London and the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead Heath - the only hospital in Britain equipped to treat an ebola patient and contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts believe that if the man stays in Sierra Leone he will almost certainly die, because its hospitals are so poorly equipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two American volunteers who contracted the virus in Liberia were recently flown back to the US for treatment, and have recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the medical director of the NHS said there was no reason for the British public to be afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said: We have prepared rigorous plans for this type of situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This individual will pose no risk to the public, and only the tiniest risk to those who those who come into direct contact with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not an airborne virus and can only be transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, vomit, sweat and diarrhoea.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to fly the British man home was taken yesterday morning in a meeting involving Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Sir Bruce and Number 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Ministry of Defence source said the man would be flown back in a C-130 Hercules, probably from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. The ebola outbreak, which has ripped through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in West Africa, is by far the biggest ever recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far there have been 2,615 confirmed cases and 1,427 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), and casualties continue to mount by the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of British volunteers are thought to be working with ebola patients across the region. Although they wear full biological protection suits and are highly trained in infection control, they run the risk every day of catching the killer disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday Ivory Coast became the latest country to close its land borders due to fears over the spreading virus, following the lead of Senegal, Cameroon, Gabon and South Africa, which have imposed similar restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease is now spreading to Nigeria, which has major links to the UK. So far, five people in that country have died of ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued updated advice earlier this week which urged travellers to carefully assess their need to travel to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General medical facilities throughout Sierra Leone are currently under severe strain due to the ebola outbreak, and unable to provide the same standard of healthcare as in the UK. Dedicated healthcare facilities for ebola are overwhelmed,' the FCO warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone on August 5 until the end of the month over concerns about the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carrier normally operates a four-times-a-week service from Heathrow to Freetown in Sierra Leone, with a connection on to Monrovia in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only other Briton ever known to have contracted ebola is former laboratory technician Geoffrey Platt, who accidentally pricked his thumb while taking a sample from an infected guinea pig at the Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire, in November 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suffered three days of extreme weakness, diarrhoea and vomiting, and a rash that covered his body - but he survived. Mr Platt then spent 40 days in quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 80, he said earlier this month: The public need to be alert and everything needs to be done to stop ebola breaking out in Britain.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was confirmed yesterday that an Irish engineer who died at home after returning from working in Sierra Leone had not contracted ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT IS EBOLA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is an infectious and usually fatal disease which spreads through contact with body fluids. Initial symptoms include muscle pain, fever and a sore throat which turns into severe internal bleeding from the mouth, rectum and eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus attacks almost all kinds of tissue, reducing organs and flesh to a pudding-like mush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 90 per cent of victims die - making ebola one of the most lethal viruses known to man. Most succumb within six to 16 days of infection. Since the disease was identified in 1976, no clinically proven cure has emerged. However, charity MSF has improved survival rates using antibiotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outbreaks have occurred primarily in remote villages in central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECURE WARD WHERE HE'LL FIGHT FOR LIFE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN'S first ebola patient will be treated at the country's only High Secure Infectious Disease Unit (HSIDU), at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It contains just two beds in a ward large enough to normally fit 20. The medic will be wheeled in, enclosed in the same isolation tent used to transport him from Sierra Leone, to minimise contamination risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit contains an array of special equipment to ensure he does not pass on the virus - including a negative pressure' air flow to make sure no virus particles escape either the tent or the room itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will be treated by a specialist team including infectious diseases consultant Dr Stephen Mepham.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 59, recovered after being given the drug which had previously shown promising signs in tests on primates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brantly said he was delighted as he and Ms Writebol were discharged from hospital last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: Today is a miraculous day and I am thrilled to be alive and to be reunited with my family.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infectious diseases specialist Dr Bruce Ribner said that after treatment with ZMapp he was confident that Dr Brantly had fully recovered and that he could return to his family and professional life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Writebol's husband said in a statement that she too was free of the virus but had been significantly weakened by her ordeal. It remains unclear if the drug was entirely responsible for the pair's recovery, but out of six people known to have received ZMapp, two have recovered, three have shown improvement and one has died, according to the World Health Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMapp was also given to a Spanish priest who died from the virus having been flown home, while three Liberian health workers are showing signs of improvement following treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drug's manufacturer, Mapp Pharmaceuticals, acknowledges that more trials are needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has now run out of the drug after providing it free to anyone who requested it to treat ebola victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the firm is looking to work with the US Government to make more of the potential cure, after being criticised for not being able to treat more people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collateral hardship from the Ebola epidemic now includes a delay for Mercy Ships, which operates the world's largest civilian hospital ship in ports on the West Coast of Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a news release from Mercy Ships, already with one canceled deployment to Guinea, where Ebola first broke out last December, the Mercy Ship now waits in the water with crew and staff, pending an end of the August decision on field service in Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mercy Ship was due to sail from the port of Cotonou, Benin, for its 10-month field service last week but has delayed that sail pending further assessment due to the virulence of the outbreak in neighboring Nigeria. Earlier, in April, Mercy Ships canceled the hospital ship's planned deployment to Guinea, where the Ebola outbreak began last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently docked in the Canary Islands, following the vessel's annual maintenance phase, the 16,500-ton Mercy Ship is designed to deploy specialized surgical expertise and educational support. The news release said it is unequipped to treat viral epidemics, according to the charity's president and founder Don Stephens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Multi-bed wards and limited isolation facilities, close proximity to crew accommodation and dining for families and children are but a few restraints,&quot; Stephens said. &quot;We also hire 200 day crew in each port as part of our training and capacity building for Africa.&quot; Stephens said the organization is closely monitoring the situation on the whole of the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is and remains our priority, but crew safety drives every decision,&quot; he emphasized in the news release. &quot;We request prayer as we consider all options to manage the risk, including deployment to other unaffected nations.&quot; This ship's crew of 400 represents 40 nations, with up to 60 children on board at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the US Center for Disease Control recommendations, Mercy Ships have banned crew travel to Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. Likewise, crew, guests and day crew may not board the Mercy Ship for at least 21 days after they have visited one of the four affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mercy Ships has many, many friends in West Africa,&quot; Stephens said. &quot;In the meantime, our prayers go out to all those affected by this terrible epidemic, especially those in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Docking in an African port, the ship brings high-tech equipment, state-of-the-art facilities, highly skilled doctors, free specialized surgeries, healthcare training, including instrument sterilization and disease prevention, agricultural training and more. Mercy Ships provides many types of surgeries: maxillofacial, plastic reconstructive, orthopedic, and general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the news release, the organization also offers dental care and eye care, and works with local government and healthcare providers to improve local healthcare delivery systems. Since the first arrival of a Mercy Ship in 1991 to Togo, 23 of the 35 years of Mercy Ships service have been focused in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 29-year-old woman, from Guinea in West Africa, was being held in a cell after being arrested by immigration officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officers decided to shut down the 20-cell custody block when she developed a mild fever late on Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was transferred to a local hospital where she was undergoing tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Health England said the measures were &quot;precautionary&quot;, and that it was &quot;very, very unlikely&quot; the patient would test positive for the virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airlines have cancelled more than a third of international flights to three west African countries over fears that an outbreak of the Ebola virus could spread, as more African countries introduce measures to block visitors from affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of 590 monthly flights scheduled to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, 216 have been cancelled, according to OAG, an airline data provider. Although 14 cases of Ebola have been reported in Nigeria, flights to and from the country have not been affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries are introducing measures to stop Ebola from spreading: South Africa on Thursday banned travellers from Ebola-stricken countries from entering the country, and yesterday Senegal announced it was closing its border with Guinea as a preventative measure, while Chad said it had closed its border with Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria confirmed two new Ebola cases yesterday - both spouses of medical workers who had direct contact with Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer, who flew into Nigeria last month with the virus and infected 11 others before he died in July. The male and female caregivers both subsequently died of Ebola, after infecting their spouses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) is concerned that the scale of the outbreak has been underestimated especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and that many people with Ebola symptoms have not been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past two weeks new treatment centres in Liberia have been overwhelmed as soon as they opened by patients who had not previously been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a situation assessment issued yesterday, WHO said this had &quot;never before been seen in an Ebola outbreak&quot;, and said that it suggested &quot;an invisible caseload of patients&quot; was going undetected by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria's Arik Air, Togo's ASKY Airlines, British Airways, Emirates Airlines and Kenya Airways have together cancelled a combined 76 scheduled flights to Guinea, 70 to Liberia and 70 to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Airways on Tuesday became the latest airline to freeze routes to Liberia and Sierra Leone after Kenya's ministry of health recommended a temporary ban, calling the Ebola outbreak &quot;vastly underestimated&quot; and saying it was &quot;expected to continue for some time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With fears growing that quarantining the affected countries will damage their economies and increase food shortages, WHO has urged airlines to keep routes to west Africa operational, saying it &quot;does not recommend any ban on international travel or trade&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: &quot;Travel restrictions and active screening of passengers on arrival at sea ports, airports or ground crossings in non-affected countries that do not share borders with affected countries are not currently recommended by WHO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riots broke out in a slum in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, on Wednesday as residents desperate for food rations battled police. The World Food Programme (WFP) said that about 1 million people are facing food shortages because of quarantines around the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air France, which has not suspended any flights, said it requires passengers in Conakry in Guinea, Freetown in Sierra Leone and Lagos in Nigeria to have their temperature taken before boarding an aircraft. &quot;They are only given their boarding card if no medical symptoms are present,&quot; a spokeswoman said. Other airlines have taken similar precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air France crews refused to board flights destined for Ebola-affected countries this week, rasing concerns that it could scrap routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brussels Airlines, the only European carrier to serve all three affected countries, said it would continue flights, while Dutch airline KLM said, &quot;travellers are highly unlikely to be infected with Ebola, which cannot be transmitted under normal hygiene conditions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways, which announced on 5 August that it would suspend its service to Sierra Leone and Liberia, has said it would review the severity of the Ebola outbreak at the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1,350 people are thought to have died from the Ebola outbreak since it began in March, according to WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Nabarro, the UN's system coordinator on Ebola, arrived in Monrovia this week as part of a trip to affected countries. He is also scheduled to visit Freetown, Conakry and Abuja in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO said yesterday it was working on a six to nine-month plan designed to ease the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two American missionaries who were infected with the Ebola virus while working in Liberia were released from an Atlanta hospital yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 60, both Christian Aid workers, were infected in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, last month as the largest outbreak in history swept West Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were airlifted to Emory University Hospital for treatment three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am thrilled to be alive, to be well and to be reunited with my family,&quot; Dr Brantly said, looking thin but otherwise healthy as he smiled and held hands with his wife. &quot;I am incredibly thankful to all of those who were involved in my care, from the first day of my illness all the way up to today - the day of my release from Emory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak of Ebola has killed 1,350 people and infected more than 2,400 since March in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no known cure for the virus, which has a mortality rate of more than 60 per cent, although both American patients were given an experimental drug called ZMapp. However, the drug is in short supply and doctors have stressed that they have no way of knowing if it helped the patients recover or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Dr Brantly received a blood transfusion in Liberia from a boy who had recovered from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Bruce Ribner, the director of Emory's infectious diseases unit, said the effects of treatment by blood transfusion were also unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Writebol, who was released from hospital on Tuesday, had requested privacy and did not want details of her medical condition to be made public, doctors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Ireland's health service said yesterday it was carrying out tests on a suspected case of the Ebola virus in the body of a person who recently returned from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Blood samples have been sent for laboratory testing to confirm whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease,&quot; it said, adding that the risk of transmission of any disease is considered to be extremely low.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed the suspected victim, whom locals named as Dessie Quinn, from the Doorin area, outside Mountcharles, Co Donegal, was a father of one aged 43. He is thought to have been living with his partner in Dublin but was visiting his large family in Co Donegal when he was taken ill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two US humanitarian workers who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia were released from hospital yesterday after receiving an experimental drug treatment that has yet to go through full clinical and human trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kent Brantly from Texas and Nancy Writebol, a missionary from North Carolina, contracted the deadly virus while working in Liberia for an evangelical Christian group. They were both treated for three weeks with the drug called ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today is a miraculous day,&quot; said Brantly at a press conference at Emory University hospital in Atlanta to announce his discharge. &quot;I am thrilled to be alive, to be well and to be reunited with my family.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation said this month that unlicensed drugs and vaccines can ethically be used to treat the outbreak, which has so far claimed at least 1,200 lives in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors cautioned that it was too soon to hope the treatment could hasten the end of the public health crisis. Dr Bruce Ribner, medical director of Emory hospital's infectious disease unit, said it was unclear if the drug had contributed to the pair's recovery, and suggested it may have even delayed their return to health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian officials have said three African medics who have also been given the treatment are showing &quot;remarkable signs of improvement&quot;. But Ribner said there was no scientific basis to suggest the treatment was a cure. &quot;They are the very first ever to receive these agents. We do not know if it's improved them . . . or even delayed their recovery,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the treatment is effective, the California-based manufacturer of ZMapp, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said &quot;the available supply of ZMapp has been exhausted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re-infection is possible, but Ebola survivors are highly unlikely to contract the virus a second time and the hospital said their release posed no risk to public health. &quot;Limited knowledge of the Ebola virus, especially in our country, has created understandable anxiety and fear for some persons,&quot; said Ribner. &quot;However, we cannot let our fears dictate our actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointedly, Brantly and his wife Amber held hands before he read from a written statement, and he hugged members of his care team. He came close to tears several times while thanking his aid group, North Carolina-based Samaritan's Purse, and the Emory medical team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital said Writebol had been discharged without publicity on Tuesday. Asked why her release was not announced, Ribner said the hospital decided to release the patients after a rigorous course of treatment and thorough testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is five months since the first case of Ebola was confirmed in Guinea. It spread quickly into Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. According to the World Health Organisation, 2,473 people have contracted the disease which, once symptomatic, can kill within five days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Senegal closed its border with Guinea because of the outbreak, according to a government statement carried by APS, the national press agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly, 33, said the virus was not on the radar when he and his family moved to west Africa two years ago, but he noticed a steady increase in Ebola patients in June and July. His wife and children returned to the US on 20 July, but Brantly stayed on to continue his work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, he fell ill. &quot;I woke up feeling under the weather, and then my life took an unexpected turn as I was diagnosed with Ebola virus disease,&quot; he said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was flown out of Liberia on 2 August in a private jet fitted with a containment tent and was admitted to Emory, which is one of only four institutions in the US capable of handling patients with a disease of this nature, according to the hospital. Writebol, 59, arrived three days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two emphasised their desire to spend time with their families, since the nature of the disease requires isolation treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family and I will now be going away for a period of time to reconnect, decompress and recover,&quot; Brantly said, after thanking all the people involved in his care and hugging many individually at the press conference. &quot;For now, we need some time together, after a month apart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writebol has gone to &quot;an undisclosed location&quot;, said the North Carolina-based aid group SIM, for whom she had been working in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nancy is free of the virus, but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition,&quot; her husband, David, said in a statement. &quot;Thus, we decided it would be best to leave the hospital privately to be able to give her the rest and recuperation she needs at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ribner warned that the fight against Ebola is &quot;far from over&quot;, as it continues to spread across west Africa. &quot;What we learned in caring for them will help advance the world's understanding of how to treat Ebola infections and hopefully improve,&quot; said Ribner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two missionaries' survival has given impetus to the search for a vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US clinical trials for what scientists hope is a promising new vaccine have been brought forward, according to the US National Institutes of Health. Its researchers have been working on a vaccine with Okairos, a Swiss-Italian company owned by Britain's GlaxoSmithKline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease is out of control in Sierra Leone and Liberia, both of which have declared states of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Medecins sans Frontieres director of operations Brice de la Vigne told the Guardian the international community was taking &quot;almost zero&quot; interest in the crisis, saying the outbreak would not be contained unless western leaders implemented an emergency operation comparable to the response to any other natural disaster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following serious tension between residents of West Point and security forces on Wednesday, calm has returned to the densely populated community and Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State security including the Armed Forces of Liberia, Liberia National Police and other paramilitary security forces deployed in the troubled community restored calm in West Point and surrounding areas after the community was quarantined by government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Point was quarantined as a result of the surfacing of the deadly Ebola virus in the township that hosts over 40,000 of Liberia's population. Visiting the community late Wednesday evening, Police Director Chris Massaquoi called for calm following Wednesday's incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quarantining of the congested community of West Point led to serious commotion and massive looting of the Holding Center that was established in the community prior to the quarantining. The situation has been brought under control by the Liberia National Police headed by Director Chris Massaquoi and the Liberian military under the command of Defense Minister, Brownie Samukai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial activities and the movement of residents of Monrovia were impeded when news broke out on Wednesday that West Point has been quarantined by Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Massaquoi who toured the West Point community encouraged residents to remain calm and do away with social activities including football and other sporting activities. He said sports is one of the easiest ways of contracting the deadly Ebola virus. Director Massaquoi also encouraged them to adhere to the preventive measures given by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to avoid the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Massaquoi met and spoke with residents of the West Point community late Wednesday evening following serious commotion between residents and state security. He called on the residents to allow health workers carry on their responsibilities in the community in order to protect themselves against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police boss ordered the reopening of the Police Depot in the West Point Community and Slipway. He then urged residents of the quarantined community to return to their various houses as government was doing everything possible to provide food, medication and other basic necessities for those in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further stated that the situation that led to the serious tension between state securities and residents of the quarantined township of West Point was as the result of the township of West Point denying health workers from performing their tasks and the looting of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our reporter a team from the Liberia National Police and some journalists who visited the township late Wednesday evening observed that security forces deployed in the area including soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia, the Liberia National Police have succeeded in restoring calm in the densely populated slum community of West Point.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the quarantined communities in Liberia, Dolo's Town in Margibi County remained calm yesterday despite clashes in West Point, a densely populated community that was also quarantined in Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a team of Inquirer reporters who visited the community observed that despite the calmness of the township, residents of Dolo's Town have complained of lack of food and medication in the affected community. Dolo's Town and West Point were quarantined recently by the Government of Liberia as the Ebola virus spreads in both communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town which is in the Harbel area is surrounded by police and military officers to make sure that no one leaves the town. Meanwhile the residents are moving about with their normal activities while health workers are going from house to house to take temperatures of residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Joint Task Force commander at Dolo's Town, Lt. Gavan Milton said the people of Dolo's Town are very peaceful and cooperative and that they are having no problem at all as everything is going on very smoothly and that in fact the youths are the ones who are creating awareness and making sure that everyone takes the preventive measures necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the residents are so peaceful as though nothing is happening and there is no sign of hostility from the youths or the older people. They are glad that the people have realized that what the Government is doing is for their own good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Acting City Mayor of Unification City, Emmanuel Fayia Fartumay, said he is glad that the youths are willing to work along with the Joint Task Force. He said there is no problem at all and that they are praying for the Ebola Virus to go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, they have had several cases and they are doing all they could to make sure that the people of Dolo's Town take the preventive measures. He said they are glad that the death rate has reduced, but that one thing that should be clear is that all the deaths are not Ebola related.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youth of Voinjama district with support from the John Emmanuel Paivey Foundation has given twenty-five buckets and other items to ten communities within the district. The buckets were placed at strategic locations within the communities to ensure that people are able to wash their hands with chlorinated water as a means of preventing the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the buckets were being distributed within the communities the youth explained to citizens about the virus, its symptoms, how it can be contracted, the importance of suspending traditional practices at this time especially burial rites, how people could protect themselves from contracting the virus and what to do when there are suspected cases of virus within the communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communities benefitting from the donation and awareness initiative included central Voinjama, Mandingo quarter, kissi quarter, and several motocycle parking stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the donation at the Mandingo quarter parking station Mohammed Kamara, the operations person called on the youth group to take its activities to other parts of Voinjama including Bakedu town from where he hailed, a place where reverence to the dead such as bathing is a deeply entrenched traditional practice that has been one of the major causes of the rapid spread of the disease. Mr. Kamara said he was happy with the efforts and that his kinsman needed to be continuously educated about the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The origin of the Ebola viral outbreak in Liberia is traced to Lofa County. Since its spread in Liberia, Lofa continue to have the highest number of death and reported cases as a result of the rapid spread of the disease which is due to migration and traditional practices such as burial and funeral rites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youth chair Andrew Akoi said the donations and awareness activities are sponsored by the John Emmanuel Paivey Foundation, a Philanthropic organization with the goal of assisting and empowering the most vulnerable in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the activities of the youth will continue in the coming days with the expansion of a coalition of Zoes, elders, Imam, women and youth groups' to continue the initiative to fight the spread of the Ebola disease in Lofa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. AKoi said he was concern about sustaining the wash stations within the communities where the bucket had been placed due to the limited quantity of chlorine distributed. He called on other Liberians and citizens hailing from Lofa to support the initiative by making donations through the foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The John Emmanuel Paivey Foundation is appealing to international organizations and other Liberians at home and abroad to support the efforts to stop the spread of the Ebola disease in Lofa County.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Monrovia, Liberia; 21 August 2014): The National Executive Committee of the Congress for Democratic Change is troubled by the reemergence of the Military's use of deadly force against unarmed civilians in WestPoint and calls for an independent inquiry. The leadership of the CDC being categorical in its condemnation of the joint actions of the Liberia National Police backed by the Military, also believes urgent measures to deescalate spiraling tensions in WestPoint and other parts of the country are imperative decisions the President is encouraged to envisage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of looming dangers of increased confrontation between residents of the densely populated community of WestPoint and armed security forces, the leadership of the CDC requests government to review its decision to quarantine the Township. This thoughtful action would avert an imminent humanitarian crisis in a Township soon to run out of food and safe-drinking water, amidst inadequate healthcare facilities to diagnose and contain new patients that could expand the circle of infection. Except where these conditions are met to warrant an imposition of quarantine, the decision would pose serious humanitarian consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Congress for Democratic Change remains cynical of the armed Military's intervention in a national biological emergency, it nonetheless bewails the grave threats of the Ebola virus, and its disastrous aftereffects on people, economy, and regional security. This nightmare being detrimental to our collective existence as a country, the Congress for Democratic Change recommends the formation of a Joint-Task Force led by the Liberia National Red Cross, international humanitarian organizations, and political parties, to harmonize a singular frontier of containment against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With substantial gratefulness to health workers, foreign and domestic, who continue to make enormous sacrifices, as we pay tribute to deceased brothers and sisters victimized in the fight against Ebola, the CDC equally commend media institutions (print, electronic and social) for the remarkable deploy of their broadcast resources. in additional efforts to create anti-Ebola awareness, the leadership of the CDC believes continuous media enlightenment, joint community-based outreaches by the right personnel, suitable quarantine centers away from populated areas, empowered/equipped specific medical facilities, and a secured health-worker, are necessary essentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC places particular emphasis on the important role of civil society institutions and the media in the fight against Ebola, and suggests an immediate meeting between government, the Press Union of Liberia/its member institutions, other relevant media functionaries, and a consortium of Civil Society organizations. The CDC is seized of the mindset that said meetings would stimulate strategic implementation of dynamic educational programs made possible by reasonable allocation of state resources, which should not be difficult at this time of strong international goodwill towards Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being mindful of the grave threats of Ebola as a national security priority that must be decisively confronted, yet with cautious restrain as the nation moves past a dark chapter of security sector oversteps, the Congress for Democratic Change views the imposition of curfew as unhelpful actions of unclearly explained motives that may complicate patient's access to healthcare institutions during serious emergencies while movements are restricted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Congress for Democratic Change continue to urge its general membership throughout the country and beyond to exercise respect for the rule of law, it is however believes government's recent actions create a confused state of uncertainty, fear, and dampens a collective spirit against the permeating health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eager to understand the growing complexities of the unfolding state of affairs, akin to recommendations sprung out of a burning desire to help our country back on the course of recovery, the CDC is requesting an audience with the President, Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, and hope it takes place soon enough to allow a frank discussion on ongoing challenges besetting our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lastly, the prevailing humanitarian challenges of residents of the Township of WestPoint ought to strike the conscience of every well-meaning Liberian, for which the Congress for Democratic Change has setup a special Humanitarian Assistance Committee, which anticipates a timely relief intervention in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This position-statement of the Congress for Democratic Change, authorized by its National Executive Committee, is issued by Nathaniel F. McGill, Act. National Chairman/Secretary General...</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the overwhelming outbreak of this virus that is claiming the lives of our people, on Wednesday August 6, 2014, President Sirleaf declared a ninety (90) days State of Emergency with reference to Article 86 a and b of the Liberian Constitution. The state of emergency took the citizenry by surprise in the mix of poverty and economic degradation. Though the President declaration has a good intent which is part of the strategy to battle the epidemic and restore the land free of Ebola, we need not forget the socio-political and economic implication to the state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Socio-Political implication to the state of emergency:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a state of emergency is declared, some rights of the citizens shall be suspended. In this light, the citizens shall remain observance of the state of emergency knowing that some of their rights have been temporarily suspended until the country returns to normalcy. But any citizens or institutions caught doing otherwise especially against Government under said restricted atmosphere, this might warrant such persons or institutions to face the full consequences of the law. But in the first place, every state of emergency must have some kind of exception according to crisis management or crisis prevention experts. But Madam Sirleaf was insensitive to the plights of some privileged group of Liberians in her declaration and mandate. The closure of Medical Center without considering the medications of people with disabilities, pregnant women and children is against international and humanitarian laws. This act is also in extreme conflict with the United Nation Convention on the rights of children, women and people with disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political commentators are also speculating that Madam Sirleaf being the head of the Taskforce was unequivocally unwise decision. Instead, there should have been crisis management or crisis prevention experts whether local or foreign to head the Taskforce in the fight against Ebola while, Madam Sirleaf sits as the &quot;watch- dog&quot; to this process. As the momentum to fight the epidemic is on the rise, Madam Sirleaf has again buttressed the state of emergency with curfew thereby restricting the movement of citizens at night from 8:00am -9:00pm, businesses and entertainment Centers from 8:00am -6:00pm. Having experience our chaotic past, there must be something beyond the scope of Ebola that citizens may not know now which is influencing the Government to take those decisions by taking security measures. Though it is not our wish for anything contrary other than peace and stability, but we need to start thinking beyond the scope of Ebola and get prepare for the unforeseen circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Economic implication to the state of emergency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration of a state of emergency by the President and with the concurrence of the upper and lower Houses has a serious economic implication on the lives of the ordinary people. Economically, one of the ways to economic viability and efficiency is by regional trade or in other words, cross border trade. Trading goods and services and having access to farming land and market places in the exchange of goods and services are instruments of food security, economic growth and poverty reduction. 85% of our food intake is by importation from USA, China and neighbouring countries within the Sub African region. As a result of the state of emergency, our borders are closed thereby impeding the aspect of regional or cross border trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of importation of goods and services is directly proportional to an increase in the price of consumer's goods and services and especially eatable and petroleum commodities. Merchants have already started taking advantage of the current state of the Country and its economy by double pricing communities on the market. The entire country is now on pause while businesses are closing and companies are cutting down staff day-by-day. 65% of the working population including both public and private sectors is home seated in observance of the state of emergency, as the economy of the country remains abstract and in the state of unpredictability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To curtail the Ebola epidemic, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast have closed borders with Liberia. But new development has reviled that Ivory Coast has reconsidered border closure with Liberia speaking of Mino-River Union solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian President has described Patrick Sawyer as &quot;MAD MAN&quot; and the cradle for the spread of Ebola in Nigeria which has resulted in the suspension of flights with Liberia indefinitely and while Kenya has also followed same resulting from the epidemic. Delta Airline is equally shutting down flight from Liberia very soon on grounds that the economy of the country is causing the system more in spending than benefit. But on the overall, the decision for Delta to shut down flight from Liberia is mostly attributable to the Ebola epidemic but, in disguise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion/Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While members of the three (3) Branches of Government are parading in 100-150 thousand US Dollars cars at the expense of tax payer money, there is a need in this critical time for Government to cut-down cost on luxury spending that has no impact on the lives of our people and purchase more Ambulances to pick-up Ebola affected patients to health Center and dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that at least five 5 Ambulances must be assigned to each County where the epidemic is on the rise. Ex: Lofa and Montserrado Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open Health Centers for pregnant women, children and people with disabilities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two 2 quarantine Centers only in a Country of over 3.5 million populations are inadequate. The government needs to construct more quarantine Centers within the fifteen political Subdivisions with at least Five (5) Centers in each County where the epidemic is on the increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers should be well equip with protective materials as well as having good incentives and other benefits like medical and life insurance, for they are the front- liners in the fight against this killer virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let Medical practitioners stop describing people generally as Ebola survival when some of the cases are Non-Ebola related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let the Taskforce be headed by Crisis management or Crisis prevention experts while President Sirleaf sits in the seat of a &quot;Watch Gog&quot; as she carries on her statutory responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekly update must be given from the taskforce on Ebola status within the Country including challenges and prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We citizens must also do due-diligence to ourselves by being committed to observing preventive measures as we all fight together in making our country Ebola free</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has announced the arrival of the Senior UN Systems Coordinator for Ebola, David Nabarro, who according to the Mission will meet with key partners in the Government-led fight against Ebola during his three-day visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Liberia, Karin Landgren in a release said UN Secretary-General's appointment last week of Dr. Nabarro as Senior UN Systems Coordinator for Ebola and his immediate visit to the most affected countries underscores the UN's commitment to rolling back the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the release, the scope and scale of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is unprecedented, with over 1,350 deaths now recorded in the three countries and the numbers of new cases and deaths continuing to grow. In Liberia, 964 confirmed, probable or suspected cases have been reported. The actual number is likely much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN SRSG noted that &quot;Dr. Nabarro's first priority is to help stop the spread of the Ebola virus. &quot;This demands a sustained, fully coordinated international response, which must include an influx of qualified international medical personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that many materials are still lacking, including chlorine, gloves, personal protective equipment, tents and body bags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Landgren disclosed that health-care systems in the most affected countries were weak before the outbreak and indicated that now they are overwhelmed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has reoriented several parts of its operations to support the Government in the fight against Ebola. The Mission is leading a crisis logistics team at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, and providing support to Superintendents and County Health Teams through UNMIL Field Offices in every county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNMIL is taking every necessary precaution to protect its personnel, which enables UN Police and military to continue providing back-up security to the Liberia National Police. UNMIL Radio and the Mission's outreach team are disseminating information on Ebola prevention and response, along with UNICEF and the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola's impact now extends far beyond the families and communities of those infected with the virus. This situation poses a threat to broader public health, food security, physical security, and the national economy,&quot; said Landgren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN is working very hard to help mitigate these associated risks, for instance by providing food in some quarantined areas. But if we are to preserve the gains made over these 11 years of peace, Ebola must quickly be stopped,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nabarro will also visit Sierra Leone and Guinea, as well as Nigeria, where 12 cases of Ebola have been recorded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">629 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Streets Of Monrovia are calm and normal commercial activities have resumed just a day following violent protest that left four persons in the township of West Point injured, including a 15-year-old teenager, who reportedly sustained serious wounds that would ultimately result to the amputation of his leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defense Ministry admits that security forces did fire shots in the air, but not at protesters. However, some residents in the township told this paper via telephone that the security forces fired at protesters during Wednesday's event.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Protest On Wednesday, August 20, 2014 was triggered after the Commissioner of the Township of West Point, Miata Flowers informed security forces that her family had been held by some residents of the township and that she wanted security personnel to rescue them. In the process, chaos erupted and the protesters started throwing stones and other objects at the armed officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Protesters At some point became aggressive by throwing stones which reportedly resulted to some officers sustaining injuries. Security forces fired warning shots as protesters dodged for cover. News of the violence in West Point spread to other parts of the country, especially in Monrovia that was virtually shut down. Businesses were closed and the streets were completely disserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fight Against Ebola took a different trend far from the mandate announced earlier by the government. West Point, a densely population community, had been quarantined days after mob action in the township which resulted to some 17 suspected Ebola patients fleeing the isolation center. Some West Pointers criticized the government for creating an Ebola isolation center in their community believed to be densely populated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whilst We Believe that the Liberian government has the constitutional rights to impose a state of emergency and curfew based on emerging situations, however, we believe that certain mandates that have been given to security forces should be relaxed. The incident on Wednesday has already been condemned by two renowned human rights organizations. The Catholic Justice and Peace Commission (JPC) and Foundation for International Dignity (FIND) say the use of force by state security to ensure that citizens comply with government's measures to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus is counterproductive. In a press statement read Thursday, the two groups claimed that the use of force by state security would &quot;exacerbate an already fragile situation and cause citizens to resist these measures.&quot; JPC and FIND said while they agree that there must be some stringent measures to adequately combat the Ebola virus, however, they maintained that the use of force is not in the best interest of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Use Of force against defenseless civilians appears to be triggered by statement made by the deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Col. Eric W. Dennis recently, authorizing the military to use of force against people crossing the Sierra Leone-Liberia border at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Forces have a mandate to keep the peace and ensure that our country remains stable as it gradually takes over from the UN Mission in Liberia. What happened on Wednesday in West Point was simply the use of unwarranted power against powerless civilians. The behavior of protesters to challenge state security forces, whether by throwing stones or use of invectives is repugnant, but it does not imply that state security should use force against the very people they will defend in time of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, We Call on the government to ensure that security forces relax the use of force against defenseless citizens because we are not at war with each other; instead we [as a nation and people] are united in fighting against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Ugandian Ebola expert doctor Atai Omoruoto says the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Liberia is very deceptive. She said the disease is deceptive due to the manner in which it kills people, especially those who are healthy instantly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From what I have observed since I came here (Liberia), is that this ebola disease is very deceptive because it kills people who are healthy instantly when they come in direct contact with it; you could be healthy and working and could just drop and die,&quot; Dr. Omoruoto said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omoruoto made statement Thursday when a delegation from the World Health Organization (WHO) headed by Assistant Director General Keiji Fobode visited the JFK Memorial Hospital and the ELWA Hospital..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruoto told the delegation that although the Ebola in Liberia is similar to the ones that were discovered in Uganda in the mid 70s, but the speed at which it is moving is very high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the virus is spreading more in adults than that of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed the delegation that the health system in Liberia is slow in responding to Ebola and other related cases, expressing the need for the health system to catch up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explained that shortage of vehicles to respond to Eebola and other health issues remains a huge challenge, while there is inadequate techicians to deal with the outbreak in the country. She indicated that food for Ebola patients has been a problem because they need to have a special type of diet which is purely nutritional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She disclosed that two of the nine local health workers assigned at the JFK died on Sunday, August 17, 2014 while additional two health workers are being treated for coming in contact with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the delegation, a local Liberian Medical Doctor J. Soka Moses said health workers are dying as a result of the lack of medical equipment (Personal Protective Equipment) and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctor Moses told the WHO team that food and PPE are needed for the health workers to enable them respond effectively to the outbreak in the country. He said the survival rate of those infected by the EVD is very low and government needs to provide the necessary support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moses also said that stigmatization is high in communities where health workers are assigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people find out that you are working at any of these hospital where there is ebola patient, they don't want to interact with you again and this is bad&quot; Doctor Moses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, WHO Assistant Director General Keiji Fobode assured the health workers of his organization's support. He promised that WHO will provide food and medical eqipment for patients and health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we can work on some of these concerns, but we need to know about the monetary cost or figure that is needed&quot; Fobode said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement read by JPC acting Director, Pilate Johnson, at a news conference Thursday, the two groups claimed that the use of force by state security would &quot;exacerbate an already fragile situation and cause citizens to resist these measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPC and FIND said while they agree that there must be some stringent measures to adequately combat the Ebola virus, however, they maintained that the use of force is not in the best interest of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups said survey they conducted depicts that when the communities are consulted and involved in the process, the fight will be holistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They made reference to residents of Geewloh in Mount Barclay, Montserrado County where they (residents) voluntarily quarantined their community after 13 residents reportedly died from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government has admitted to being overwhelmed by the outbreak of the Ebola disease which has been demonstrated by the delays in responding to Ebola related cases in Monrovia alone, where it takes days for bodies to be recovered, and these new measures will only put more strain on the already scarce resources of government and additional burden on an already impoverished citizenry,&quot; the two groups said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They recommended broad base consultation with affected communities in dealing with the spread of the deadly virus as opposed to using force or military presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two groups said government must seek to win the hearts and minds of its citizens rather than impose authority by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also said the establishment of treatment centers should involve the consultation and participation of community dwellers to avoid the repeat of the West Point scenario where the residents attacked and looted an Ebola holding center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two groups, among other things, recommended the establishment of community based task force to reduce the response time to Ebola related cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We encourage government to review some of the measures already taken, many of which tend to undermine its efforts to deal with the outbreak; for instance the deployment of the military and police around affected communities to compel community residents to follow the necessary safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus,&quot; they noted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian journalists are said to be of no exception to the night time nationwide curfew imposed by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf but the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) has written the Information Ministry to grant reprieve to journalists during the curfew hours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MICAT release issued Wednesday, August 20, 2014 in Monrovia said only health workers, utility workers, airline's passengers and crew are exempt from the curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the release said concessionaries are not going to be affected by the curfew as long as they are within the confine of their concession areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides those exempt, the Liberian government is encouraging all to abide by the curfew, stressing that the curfew will be lifted as soon as the spread of the Ebola virus is significantly contained and the entire situation normalizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government then stresses that during this curfew period it anticipates the fullest cooperation of the general public and warns that violator of the curfew will be dealt with in accordance with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest decision by the government not to grant reprieve to journalists seems to have put journalists in a difficult position in the performance of their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a letter addressed to Information Minister Lewis G. Brown on Wednesday, August 20, 2014, the PUL said it wants the government to grant reprieve to journalists during the period of the curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we all work together to serve the public, it is our hope that the Government will grant a favorable consideration to our request, while we remain open and available for further discussions on the matter,&quot; PUL Secretary General D. Kaihenneh Sengbeh told Minister Brown in the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PUL said most journalists work for extensive periods, which at times run very late at night, and very early in the morning for which it is necessary to excuse the media from the curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unquestionably, the PUL is of the strongest conviction that the curfew, as imposed, will seriously hinder the work of the media and undercut its agility in providing public education and awareness on the Ebola virus outbreak and prevention,&quot; PUL stressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIOLENCE erupted in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, yesterday after security forces sealed off a slum in an attempt to stop the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Riot police and soldiers fired live rounds and tear gas to disperse a stone-throwing crowd trying to break out of a quarantine imposed on West Point, home to 50,000 people and one of the poorest and most densely populated neighbourhoods in the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four people were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These measures are meant to save lives,&quot; said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who ordered the restrictions, in an address to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence flared after security forces tried to evacuate a government official and his family from the slum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, roadblocks had been created out of piles of scrap wood and barbed wire to prevent anyone from entering or leaving the neighbourhood, which has been hit badly by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slum occupies a peninsula where the Mesurado River meets the Atlantic. Ferries to the area have been halted, and a coastguard boat was patrolling the waters around the neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people of West Point reacted with fury to the quarantine, hurling stones and shouting at the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is inhumane,&quot; said Patrick Wesseh, a resident. &quot;They can't suddenly lock us up without any warning. How are our children going to eat?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many feel that the government has not done enough to protect them from the spread of the disease. West Point residents raided an Ebola screening centre over the weekend, accusing officials of bringing sick people from all over Monrovia into their neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many areas of the capital, bodies have lain in the streets for hours, sometimes days, even though people asked that they be picked up by health ministry workers wearing protective equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the first time that such restrictions have been put in place in a capital city since the Ebola outbreak began last December. Doll Town, 30 miles south of the capital, was also sealed off, while Mrs Sirleaf imposed a nationwide curfew from 9pm to 6am in a further attempt to stem the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, 106 new deaths were reported by the United Nations health agency yesterday, bringing the total across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria to 1,350. Liberia has the highest number of deaths of the four countries - 576 - and its total is rising the fastest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN also warned in its announcement that &quot;countries are beginning to experience supply shortages, including fuel, food, and basic supplies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of airlines and shipping services have halted transport to the worst affected capitals of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were also fears yesterday that the epidemic could have spread to Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities in Vietnam said they had detained several people arriving from west Africa who they suspected could have Ebola. Two Nigerians who travelled to Vietnam from Nigeria were having tests at a specialist hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, health officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burma, a man was also being tested after arriving from Guinea. The cases follow the news on Tuesday that patients were also being tested in the United States and Spain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, I spoke to my mother at her home in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to discuss my forthcoming trip. In light of the outbreak of Ebola in the country, should I still come? She thought I should reschedule - the mood in the country was low and people were staying home. Best wait for a better time. What we didn't discuss was the chance of me catching Ebola, because we both knew the chances were minuscule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our conversation may yet be entirely academic because British Airways, on which I am booked to fly, has cancelled all flights until the end of this month and possibly beyond. The World Health Organisation issued a statement to say there was no need to suspend flights as the disease was not airborne, and anyone in the infectious stages of Ebola would be incapable of flying. &quot;Hard to save lives if we &amp; other health workers cannot get in,&quot; the WHO tweeted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, that didn't stop other airlines following suit. Kenya Airways suspended flights to Freetown, and Korean Airlines suspended flights to Nairobi, even though Kenya is 3,000 miles away. This week, a Brazilian delegation to a trade conference in Namibia cancelled its visit, citing fear of Ebola. &quot;Do these people not have a map?&quot; a spokesman for Namibia's Chamber of Commerce asked. The Namibian capital, Windhoek, is closer to Rio de Janeiro than to Guinea, where the outbreak originated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western reporting of the Ebola outbreak has been consistently overblown. Early reports claimed the virus was passed on to humans through the consumption of fruit bats, an apparent delicacy of which I'd never heard. In a scientific paper I found a more convincing explanation: the bats hang in the rafters of buildings, dropping their contaminated feces and urine below. A friend in Freetown tells me of the greeting that has replaced the customary three kisses: people knock elbows and chant &quot;Elbow, elbow-la!&quot;. This week, the New York Times reported Ebola survivors being shunned and treated as &quot;untouchable&quot; by neighbours. Much, in fact, as people in America refused to touch HIV-positive people a few decades back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, Donald Trump tweeted that American Ebola victims should not be brought home. Yet international health experts agree that the failure to contain the outbreak is due to the broken health systems in the affected countries, which are among the poorest in the world, two of which are still rebuilding following a decade of war. Simply put, this would not happen in Britain or the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In west Africa, those most at risk are the very poor, their carers and health workers. True, the disease has no cure, but reported death rates of 90% are wrong. The actual figure is 50%-55%. Agencies struggling to contain the outbreak took the international media to task for reporting an inflated figure, causing locals to view Ebola centres as no more than a place to die and therefore refuse to report symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has begun evacuating its citizens from the area. Meanwhile, another friend, who heads an NGO in Freetown and has no plans to evacuate her staff, describes the courage of the doctors and nurses working 20-hour shifts, despite the loss of nearly 100 colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some years ago I met the Sierra Leonian expert in haemorrhagic fevers, Dr Aniru Conteh, who headed the country's Lassa fever research unit. He had struggled on with his work for years despite a lack of proper equipment - reportedly at one point using a snorkel and mask while handling samples. He died after being accidentally contaminated by a patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His successor, Dr Sheik Umar Khan, spearheaded initial efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak. He too died in the line of duty, as did most members of his unit: researchers, nurses and even a driver. Their loss will have enduring consequences in the world's fight against the disease, yet their life's work has received less coverage than an idiotic remark by Trump. Read reports in the western media of Ebola hysteria and you may well ask yourself to whom the hysteria belongs. Not, apparently, to those with the most to lose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international development secretary, Justine Greening, has launched an emergency research initiative to look into spread of Ebola, which has claimed more than 1,200 lives in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &pound;6.5m programme co-funded by the Wellcome Trust was announced a day after a director of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) accused western leaders of taking &quot;almost zero&quot; interest in the crisis in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greening said she hoped the research would &quot;better equip those working on the ground so they can tackle the outbreak as effectively as possible&quot;. Val Snewin, international activities manager at Wellcome Trust, said: &quot;There's an urgency to this. We are not an emergency team, but what we can do is mobilise research. Unless someone is willing to commit to research you cannot learn to improve things either later in this outbreak or the next one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department for International Development and the trust hope to have research commissioned and completed within two months, meaning it could have an impact on the current crisis, which is expected to last more than six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the projects they may look at are case detection systems in places such as Sierra Leone and Liberia where there is illiteracy and weak health infrastructure and where accurate data on the spread of the disease is difficult to come by. Snewin said they would also be prepared to fund clinical trials for prototype diagnostic tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the World Food Programme announced it was stepping up emergency food deliveries after reports of shortages in quarantined areas. MSF has called for international leadership and resources to tackle Ebola. The UK's Disaster Emergency Committee has said it would support a transnational intervention if asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DEC spokesman, responding to MSF's plea, said: &quot;A regional monitoring and tracing programme would require leadership from national governments in the affected countries, probably with the support of the UN agencies. Were such a programme initiated, many DEC members might well be in a position to support it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, police in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, fired teargas to disperse a crowd agitating to leave a neighbourhood placed under quarantine because of Ebola, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has the highest death toll of the four west African countries affected by the disease, with the fastest-rising number of cases. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf ordered the quarantine and imposed a night-time curfew that began yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snewin said a committee of experts was in place for the initiative, drawing on the UN, WHO and academia, who could approve research proposals. Among the areas that interest Wellcome are treatment-seeking behaviour, case detection systems and clinical management.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Active commercial activities and the mobility of residents of Monrovia were yesterday impeded when news broke out that the densely populated slum community of West Point has been quarantined by Government. West Point is the home of over 20,000 of Liberia's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian soldiers used live bullets and tear gas to disburse angry crowd who were protesting the evacuation of the Township Commissioner and her family from the quarantined community. The crowd threw stones at security forces as a means of protesting the evacuation of the Commissioner. They complained that it was wrong to evacuate the Township Commissioner and her family when thousands of residents were being quarantined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But state security succeeded in taking away the Commissioner and her family amidst heavy tension. In the process according to our reporter, a twelve-year old boy sustained serious injury. Residents said the injury was a bullet wound but the AFL dismissed the information saying that the little boy was hooked by a barb wire while running. The actual cause of the boy's injury is yet to be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation led to serious tension between state securities and residents of the quarantined township of West Point as police fired tear gear at protesters vehemently protesting the quarantining of their community without prior notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia and police early Tuesday morning were deployed at strategic points leading to West Point. Mechlin Street, Randall Street, Coleman Hill, Water Street, the newly constructed Zulu Domah Bridge in Vai Town were all blocked by security forces to prevent the movement of vehicles and pedestrians from entering West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the densely populated city of Monrovia remained tensed on Wednesday as stores and business houses could not open their doors for normal business transactions. State security deployed in West Point stopped residents of the community from moving about within the township. Earlier, residents threatened to burst into stores and other business entities to get food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat by the angry residents resulted to the heavy deployment of security including AFL soldiers and police at all entry points to West Point while the entire Waterside General Market has also been quarantined thus, preventing normal business activities in that part of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following several hours of closure, Police Deputy Director for Operations, Abraham Kromah, got on the street to encourage businesses to reopen their doors to the public. He told the public that there was nothing to fear as the situation has been put under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf Tuesday evening announced the quarantining of the communities of West Point in Monrovia and Dolo's Town in Margibi County respectively. The Liberian leader in making the pronouncement said that the two communities will be quarantined effective Wednesday (yesterday) beginning at 6:00 p.m. She warned that there will be absolutely no movement in and out of West Point and Dolo's Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quarantining of the congested community of West Point created serious pandemonium in and around the city of Monrovia as soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia and officers of the Liberia National Police moved in the area to effect government's mandate that no resident or visitor leaves the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of the community threatened late Tuesday evening when President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced the imposition of the closure of all video centers by 6:00 p.m. daily, as well as the closure of all entertainment centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Liberian leader announced these measures in a nationwide address late Tuesday evening, stressing that the additional measures are intended to contain the spread of the Ebola virus disease and particularly in those areas of intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fellow citizens, these measures are meant to save lives and make the Government's efforts to combat this disease made more effective and timely,&quot; she pointed out, adding, &quot;If we can all do our part, we can defeat this disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that Government, supported by citizens' groups and partners, continue to work assiduously to combat the Ebola virus disease, emphasizing that there has been some success including several persons who have been cured from the disease. She named structures and systems that have been put in place, the human and financial resources that have been mobilized and stabilization in a few of the response communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, President Sirleaf, also chair of the National Task Force on Ebola, admitted that they have been unable to control the spread due to continued denials, cultural burying practices, disregard for the advice of health workers and disrespect for the warnings by Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, at a briefing yesterday held at the Ministry of Information, Deputy Information Minister, Isaac Jackson said the Government of Liberia is appealing to the people of West Point to be calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Jackson said the government is mobilizing resources to help the people of West Point with the necessary food items in the not too distance future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Jackson also used the occasion to clarify that the curfew that was imposed yesterday by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf does not apply to Monrovia alone but the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated further that the government imposed the curfew because some individuals are hiding the sick and the dead as a result of the deadly Ebola virus only to use the cover of darkness to bury their dead relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the curfew is intended to stop this practice as it has the propensity to further spread the Ebola virus to those who are not infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, following serious pandemonium in the Township of West Point and other part of Monrovia yesterday, calm has finally returned to the area with the intervention of state security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of journalists who visited the township late yesterday evening observed that security forces deployed in the area including soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia, the Liberia National Police and others have succeeded in restoring calm in the densely populated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the journalists' visit, it was observed that state securities are engaging residents of the quarantined community to return to their various houses as government was doing everything possible to provide food, medication and other basic necessities for those in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also observed that nothing was seriously damaged in the community and news that the AFL soldiers killed and wounded several persons in West Point had no iota of truth. The commotion was a result of an attempt by police to evacuate the Township Commissioner from West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result the city of Monrovia became paralyzed when confusion broke out between residents of West Point and security forces deployed in the quarantined community. Meanwhile, our reporter also observed trucks loaded with rice and other assorted items moving into the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of National Defense wishes to state categorically that the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) has not been issued any order to shoot and kill anybody on sight, as was reported by some media outlets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that on Friday, August 15, 2014, Col. Eric W. Dennis, Deputy Chief of Staff of the AFL and a team of security personnel toured counties in Western Liberia, assuring residents that their lives were not threatened, but protected in totality under the watch of the AFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this tour, Col. Dennis called on the AFL Task Force to remain vigilant in the execution of its assigned mission. He cautioned personnel of the AFL to be cautious in dealing with the civilians if the nation is to succeed in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on soldiers of the AFL assigned at major crossing points to be judicious in the application of the rules engagement when their lives are perceived to be threatened. The Deputy chief of staff assured the citizens of the Western Region of the AFL fullest protection and praised them for level of cooperation being rendered to the AFL which has greatly enhanced their fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of National Defense assures the citizens of Liberia and its international partners that the AFL remains a force for good and therefore calls on the public for understanding given the current security conditions as the nation collectively unite in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Honorable Minister of National Defense of Liberia says he enjoys a cordial relationship with his colleagues of the Manor River Union Basin and therefore hopes that the concerted efforts aimed creating an Ebola freed sub-region remains a major priority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON TUESDAY, PRESIDENT Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced several additional stringent measures her government will urgently embark on to curtail if not end the Ebola terror or trauma that is looming over the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN HER LATE evening address to the nation on August 19, the President among other things, imposed a 9p.m. to 6am curfew, the closure of all video clubs at 6p.m. and all night clubs beginning yesterday, August 20 and that the communities of Dolo's Town in Margibi County and West Point in Monrovia were being quarantined under full security watch with no movements in and out of those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT SIRLEAF SAID her decision was against the backdrop that her government has been unable to curtail the spread of the virus due to the continuous denial, cultural burying practices and disregard to the advice of health workers as well as disrespect for the warnings of government and the large population concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHE SAID THE above reasons have caused the spread of the disease in Monrovia and its environs but stressed that successes have also been made by the international partners and national stakeholders in the stabilization of few response communities with structures and systems put in place as well as human and financial resources mobilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE LIBERIAN LEADER did not attach any time frame for the end of her additional urgent measures imposed but said it is to save lives and make government's efforts to combat the disease more timely and therefore urged all citizens to do their part so that we as a country can return to normality once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE COMMEND THE measures taken so far by the President in the fight of the Ebola virus but our concern is with the humanitarian aspect. We urge the government to match its urgent measures with urgent humanitarian supplies into the communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS HUMANITARIAN PROVISION should take into consideration the broader rationale of a government's imposition of the curfew and quarantine system because we all may understand 'curfew' to mean seclusion and to add the quarantine aspect with a mandate for a 'full security watch' with no movements in and out, signals government's urgent preparedness to meet the basic needs of those affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALREADY, DAY ONE of the imposition has shown signs of tension in Monrovia and its environs with shops and even some banks closed in central Monrovia. There appears a shut down in the city center as news have been spread differently to other quarters of the country as to what is obtaining thereby causing more fear than the Ebola has done over the past six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE BELIEVE THAT government's measures are in the right direction but plead with you, Madam President, as head of the National Task Force in the Fight against Ebola, to make your humanitarian strategy a priority so that your 'timely' decision cannot be misconstrued and slide the nation back in the days of internal chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ALSO CALL on the citizens to exercise restraint as the government works on every modality to ensure its measures so that Ebola can be eradicated from the country. We believe these measures are just for our own good and health safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, WE ITERATE our call to you, Madam President to please give your decision a humanitarian faces so that citizens can not continue to live in perpetual fear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in the township told The NEWS on telephone yesterday that security forces used lethal force to quell the protest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the police backed by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) also used cane to flog violators. Security forces are acting under the state of emergency issued recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense authorities had instructed AFL soldiers to use 'deadly force' against violators while the Deputy Chief of Staff of the army gave similar mandate, ordering his men to shoot the legs of violators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to residents, security forces moved into West Point after they received a tipoff that the Commissioner of the Township, Miatta Flowers had been held by some protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commissioner has been accused of influencing government to locate an isolation center in the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports that some west pointers had resisted the decision of government to locate an isolation center in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security forces moved in West Point to rescue Commissioner Flower and family which triggered violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters were seen throwing stones at soldiers and police officers, which prompted warning shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early morning protest affected businesses at the busy commercial center of Water Side as the police prevented traders from transacting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest soon moved towards the center city, forcing several businesses to partially close to the public. The incident also affected normal working hours at banking institutions and other places to scale down to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest in West Point comes just a day after the Liberian government imposed a night time curfew (from 9:pm -6:am) as part of measures to quarantine the township of West Point where isolation centers have been built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a mob action led to 17 suspected Ebola patients missing from the isolation center. However, the government said all of them have reported themselves and are being treated at the JFK Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, three Liberian doctors with Ebola virus who started taking an experimental drug (ZMapp) are reportedly showing encouraging signs of improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister Lewis Brown told a news conference yesterday that the drug was given to one Nigerian and two Liberian doctors who had contracted the virus while helping to save the lives of other victims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed security officers including the military and Liberia National Police were seen posted Wednesday at the entrance of the Township to ensure that nobody leaves or enters the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian government has identified West Point as a hot spot for the deadly Ebola virus for which President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf ordered state security to quarantine the densely populated township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter who visited the area said stores and other business centers were closed apparently afraid that their stores would be looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of Waterside were seen standing on their porches in a state of bewilderment as state security officers armed to the teeth patrolled the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the West Point Township, huge residents were seen standing at the demarcation point venting out their disappointment over government's latest decision to quarantine them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blamo Johnson, one of the residents of West Point said government is in error to have quarantined the township without taking food and water there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the action by the government clearly demonstrates insensitivity to the plight of the people of West Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another resident, Rose Wreh said the government wants them to die from starvation so that it would appear that they die from Ebola. She claimed that no Ebola is in the Township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said some of them come to town daily to hustle in order to sustain their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said government's latest action will lead them to survive at the mercy of God as they have no other means to feed their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other residents told The NEWS that prices of basic commodities have skyrocketed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claimed that a 25kg bag of rice that was sold for L$1,400 is now sold between L$1,700 and L$1,900.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A journalist from New Democrat newspaper Peter Toby who is a resident of West Point said a sack of water which was sold for L$85 is now sold for L$200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said people who were selling basic commodities in the township especially the Fulani have closed down their businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist Toby also said some individuals in the township were going around warning businesses not to open or risk losing their commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in West Point also compelled owners of businesses in central Monrovia to close down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Deputy Police Director for Operations Abraham Kromah was seen in a vehicle marked RL 104 with microphone telling the people to go about their normal businesses because nothing warrants them to close down their shops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Edwin Snowe said there are some members of the Legislature who think that they can use the Ebola fight to win elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They miss it... If anybody wants to win election or vote for somebody because they fought Ebola, that person will be crazy... &quot; Rep. Snowe added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Wednesday on the Truth Breakfast Show, Rep. Snowe said the fight against the deadly virus is a national call that one does not need to anticipate getting any political favor or score any political goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This thing, we all either work together as a government or we perish as fools; and some of us will not sit here to allow it happen... &quot; Snowe maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there are times that elected officials should do away with politics and address national issues as a unit irrespective of their political affiliations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described as 'irresponsible', recent statement made by his colleague, Montserrado County District #7 Representative Solomon George that he will transport suspected Ebola bodies from West Point to the Foreign Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe said it was completely disappointing for a lawmaker to have made such irresponsible statement instead of seeking amicable remedy as a leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even though all is not well in addressing and robustly responding to the Ebola situation in the country, it is important for leaders to constructively engage the process to seek amicable remedies instead of making statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot be a leader and an advocate; you have to decide to do one. You want to stay in advocacy, then be an advocate and if you want to be in leadership as a legislator, cabinet minister or a president, then stay in leadership position... &quot; Rep. Snowe warned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN'S Armed Forces could help to set up field hospitals in Africa if the Ebola crisis worsens, the Defence Secretary said yesterday, as the World Health Organisation suggested that sufferers may be treated with blood taken from survivors of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Fallon confirmed that the Army had been assessing whether British expertise at setting up field hospitals in hostile environments could be used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that, following a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee earlier this month, the Army was examining what it could do to repatriate British citizens if they became infected with the virus, as well as assessing options for building field hospitals in infected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six out of 10 Ebola victims infected during the outbreak have died so far. The official number killed in West Africa has reached 1,229, with 2,240 cases in total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health officials are examining whether the natural immunity built up in survivors could be transferred to other victims via infusions of their plasma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the small number of cases in which blood transfusions have been tried, the results appear promising, doctors say, with antibodies found in the plasma of survivors apparently helping to fight off the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Using blood products rather than expensive drug cures would be more cost effective and therefore more obtainable for the largely impoverished nations at the heart of the outbreak. In an interview with Bloomberg, David Wood, who is leading a World Health Organisation team of doctors looking into the possibility, said: &quot;It's feasible. We're consulting with the blood operators who have capability to assist, so that we can get some realistic sense of when this could be available as an option. We'll have that information pretty soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors say Ebola survivors have antibodies created by their white blood cells as they fought off the virus. These bind to the invader microbes, either killing them or identifying them for other parts of the immune system to attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kent Brantly, an American missionary who contracted Ebola while helping to treat patients in Liberia, is known to have been given a transfusion of plasma from a 14-year-old boy. His condition has improved dramatically, although it is not clear whether this was the result of the transfusion or an experimental drug called ZMapp, which he had also taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors also say it is possible that his body would have fought off the virus even without treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics of the use of transfusions say patients who appear to do well may be responding to an infusion of plasma while suffering from a disease that takes a grim toll on the body, often causing bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While ZMapp seems to offer hope of a cure, it has not yet been properly tested and supplies are already exhausted, according to its US manufacturer, and it will take some time for more to be made. Given the scale of the crisis, the World Health Organisation has given permission for experimental drugs and treatments to be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials fear the true infection rate may be far higher than their figures suggest, with many patients in West Africa hiding away from the authorities over fear of the stigma of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Monrovia, the Liberian capital, a group of patients who fled from a quarantine centre after gunmen broke in at the weekend returned for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had been exposed to the virus and were waiting to learn whether they had contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attackers, who said they did not believe in the existence of the virus and opposed the presence of the centre in the area, also made off with bloody sheets, which have not been recovered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community has made &quot;almost zero&quot; response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, with western leaders more interested in protecting their own countries than helping contain the crisis that has now claimed more than 1,200 lives, a senior aid worker said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brice de la Vigne, the operations director of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said politicians in industrialised countries urgently needed to take action, or risk the outbreak spreading much further.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Globally, the response of the international community is almost zero,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;Leaders in the west are talking about their own safety and doing things like closing airlines - and not helping anyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments came as the World Health Organisation announced that the death toll in the world's worst Ebola outbreak has now exceeded 1,200. The haemorrhagic disease, which kills up to 90% of those infected, is ravaging Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and also has a toehold in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Vigne, who has just returned from a tour of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, said the scale of the outbreak was comparable to a catastrophe such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake, which killed 300,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The solution is not that complicated but we need to have political will to do so. Time is running against us. But you need very senior people with high profiles, the kind of people who can co-ordinate a response to a million people affected by an earthquake,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His words were echoed by Dr Gabriel Fitzpatrick, who is working at the MSF field hospital in Kailahun, the epicentre of the crisis in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this Ebola outbreak happened in a western community, in London, you'd get a few cases and that would be it,&quot; he said. &quot;The main objective here is not to dramatically increase the person's chance of survival, it's to contain the spread&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 810 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone, and 348 people have died from the virus in the country, according to World Health Organisation figures. Since June Fitzpatrick has been working in the MSF field hospital, processing patients through three stages with a &quot;suspect tent&quot;, a &quot;probably tent&quot; and a &quot;confirmed tent&quot;. Once in the final tent, their chances of coming out alive are slim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described one family of nine wiped out after a grandmother contracted the disease on 4 August. Death is swift - usually within four or five days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear, rumours and conspiracy theories have conspired with poverty and high illiteracy to allow the disease to flourish in two countries whose infrastructure is already weak. &quot;Both Sierra Leone and Liberia were at war 10 years ago and all the infrastructure was destroyed. It's the worst place on earth to have these epidemics,&quot; De la Vigne said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone and Liberia have already declared a state of emergency, but health provision is reaching breaking point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinead Walsh, who is working on the Sierra Leonean presidential Ebola task force, said the crisis was already causing deeper problems. She said more than 1 million people are in quarantine in Kailahun and neighbouring Kenema, businesses are closing, farmers are unable to trade and fears are rising about food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease is having a knock-on effect, with sick people afraid to go to hospital for fear of catching Ebola. Health workers fear deaths from malaria and in childbirth could now also escalate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are gone beyond the stage of a health crisis. This is a humanitarian emergency now.&quot; said Walsh, Ireland's ambassador to the country and head of Irish Aid in Freetown. &quot;We need to start working on the secondary crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fitzpatrick said the priority was to contain the disease, using local volunteers to find suspected cases and bring patients to hospitals where they can be isolated: &quot;The second thing is to trace those who we know have been in contact and keep them under observation. We are not doing any contact tracing at the moment,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not rocket science to do on a large scale across west Africa. But it needs an organisational structure and good leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been disclosed in Monrovia that the fight against the Ebola virus is gaining grounds in Lofa County as the situation is said to be improving on a daily basis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister told a news conference yesterday that if the death rate was ten in the county, it is now reduced to two because the people of Lofa are adhering to preventive measures being put in place by the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown told the conference that the major struggle for the government is to contain the virus in Monrovia that inhabits over a million persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown told journalists that when once sneezes in Lofa, people get concerned and report same to the authorities, saying, &quot;The situation has greatly improved in a place like Quarndo Gboni where over fifty persons had died since the virus was noticed in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown called on the people of Monrovia to adhere to the preventive measures been prescribe by the Ministry of Health, saying, it is not reporting Ebola cases and the constant denial that is increasing the virus in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown appealed to Monrovians to take the preventive measures being prescribed by the Ministry of Health seriously and stop the habit of denial which is producing counter-productive result in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the Ebola virus has killed 25 persons in Nimba County in less than three months, the Assistant Superintendent for Development, TekoYorla has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Ebola Task Force spokesperson and Assistant Superintendent for Development, Teko Yorla confirmed 48 plausible and suspected cases, 156 contacts and 25 deaths in Nimba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ganta has the population of more than 500, 000 but because of the outbreak residents of various communities are fleeing in thousands to towns and villages around the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this paper in Ganta, the city mayor, Dorr Cooper appealed to the central Government to make food available for the suspected cases quarantined by the Ebola Task Force in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the Ebola burial team charged per each dead body US$ 300. 00 to bury and the City Corporation has no money to pay the burial team in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two dead bodies have been discovered in a house at the LPMC community in Ganta with residents of the area setting road block to call the attention of authorities in the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the upsurge of the Ebola virus in Monrovia, authorities continue to struggle with how to manage the situation and bring things under control. As a result of this, several measures including the suspension of schooling activities and other steps have been taken by the Government of Liberia to enhance the fight against Ebola. However, with these measures it appears that the people of Monrovia are still in the state of denial, a situation that is causing suspected Ebola cases to increase by the days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of such incidents that might lead to the increase in the cases of suspected Ebola is the Saturday episode at the Township of West Point when uniformed youths went on the rampage and looted a Holding Center for suspected Ebola patients making away with mattresses stained with blood, some protective gears for health workers that have been used, food and some medical supplies for the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At news conference yesterday in Monrovia, Liberia's Information Minister Lewis Brown said the Ebola situation in Monrovia is increasing and the government will announce new measures soon for Monrovia. Minister Brown said Monrovia being a densely populated place requires that residents adhere to preventive measures being prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in a bid to stop the further spread of the Ebola virus. Apparently this is the case because several individuals especially those living in the slum of Monrovia are still in denial when it comes to the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the new measures to be announced by government may be, people are already speculating that entertainment centers including video clubs might be closed. Others are of the view that the government might close market buildings or impose a curfew to stop the further spread of the Ebola virus thus ending the untimely death of number of citizens. Again whatever the measure might be, the will to stop the spread of the virus depends seriously with Liberians especially Monrovians here, in this overpopulated city. Government may take actions to save lives but if the people become intransigent, then situations will undoubtedly worsen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this vein that we are appealing to all Monrovians to stop this denial and begin to respect and adhere to the preventive measures that are working in other terrains such as Guinea and our own Lofa County where the Ebola rate is decreasing gradually. It is important for Monrovians and all Liberians to know that this disease has no cure, can kill and has the propensity to fracture an entire family, community or group when preventive measures are not taken seriously and practiced. However, when everybody begin to adhere to these measures which include the washing of hands, avoiding body contacts such as handshakes and hugging as well as keeping away from crowded places, serious improvement will be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are appealing to Monrovians because we want to see an improvement relative to curtailing the spread of the virus because it has no boundary and does not know the rich, the poor, the strong or those who are frail. The more Monrovians believe that Ebola is real and begin to take preventive measures to the core, we will fast defeat this virus in our little but enjoyable Monrovia and begin the process of rebuilding our lives and console those bereaved and move forward.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN a screenwriter read The Daily Telegraph's review of his new film, he was disappointed it received only one star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animated children's feature about table footballers who come to life was summed up in a one-word headline: &quot;foul&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stung by the &quot;pernicious&quot; review, Richard O Smith decided to strike a blow for all writers hurt by a bad review by delivering some counter-criticism. He described Robbie Collin, the Telegraph's film critic, as a scourge of humanity on a par with Ebola, the conflict in Gaza, and Isis, now known as Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps he just doesn't like films? Working as a film reviewer must make him permanently furious, like someone allergic to cats working in a cattery,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Unbeatables is an Argentinian-Spanish production directed by Juan Jos&eacute; Campanella, the Oscar-winning filmmaker. It was released last year in the Spanish language to some acclaim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith was hired to write dubbed dialogue for an English language version, to be voiced by a cast, including Rupert Grint and Rob Brydon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dubbed release did not attract the praise that greeted the original. Smith took particular issue with a tweet Collin sent, which read: &quot;Even in a memorably bad summer for children, The Unbeatables is about as wretched as it gets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His review added: &quot;The Unbeatables, a half-Spanish, half-Argentinian cartoon about lead table footballers who come to life, is significantly less fun than playing with lead table footballers, or eating lead table footballers, or standing on lead table footballers in bare feet in the middle of the night while groping around for the light switch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his riposte, Smith wrote: &quot;Even in a memorably bad summer for humanity (Israel/Palestine, Isis, Ebola), Robbie Collin is about as wretched as it gets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Juan Jos&eacute; Campanella won an Oscar for his last film [The Secret in their Eyes], so he probably knows what he's doing. How many Oscars has Collin won? No, winning 'World's Worst Critic' for so many consecutive years that he gets to keep the trophy outright doesn't count.&quot; Smith, 50, is a comedy writer who has contributed to BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz and Dara O'Briain's Science Club on BBC Two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with his local paper, Smith admitted that writing dialogue to fit animated characters whose mouth movements were speaking the original Spanish lines was a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had &quot;no control over timing. It was very difficult getting them all to fit in with the lip syncing of the characters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collin said: &quot;I'm sorry to hear that Mr Smith thought my review was pernicious. I can assure him, though, that I love my job and have enjoyed many films this year, just not his.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the recent ransacking and looting of the newly established quarantine center in the congested community of West Point, the leadership of the community has appealed to the Government of Liberia for the reestablishment of the center.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, some residents of the densely populated slum community of West Point rejected government's move to establish a quarantine center in the community. As a result of fear, many of the residents went on the rampage and looted the facilities thus taking away mattresses with blood-stained beddings, rice, and generator among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing on a local radio talk show yesterday in Monrovia, the leadership of West Point condemned the looting of the center by some unscrupulous individuals residing in the township describing them as mere criminals who want nothing good in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Nelly Cooper and another leader identified as Mullah apologized to President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf for the ugly act carried out by some of the residents and appealed that the quarantine center be erected in West Point to save the entire community from contracting the deadly Ebola virus. They are at the same time calling for the deployment of the state security in the Township of West Point to ensure that anyone involved in such unwholesome act be arrested and prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the establishment of the Ebola center is a blessing for the community something that must be embraced by all residents of West Point. Madam Cooper said those who carried on the looting do not even constitute one percent of the population of West Point and as such, government must listen to them (leaders) and reestablish the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leadership of West Point has at the same time, vowed to identify, arrest and turn over for prosecution community dwellers who were involved in looting the center last Saturday. The leadership of the community also said they have retrieved some of the stolen items including generators that were taken away from the quarantine center. The leadership said items retrieved will be turned over to the committee that was set up by the leadership of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, many callers who called on the talk show yesterday called on the Government of Liberia to quarantine the Township of West Point Community following the looters of the center recently. The callers said if the community is not quarantined, the Ebola virus will rapidly spread not only in the community but the entire city and that some of those who looted the Ebola center are now leaving the community and roaming around in other communities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The early morning news and Super Morning Show were stalled yesterday when an unidentified young man lay before the main entrance of the Liberia Broadcasting System (LBS) pretending to be terribly ill of the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of the man created disorder thereby preventing workers from entering the compound and or leaving as those inside could not come out while those coming to work had to turn around in fear while the management made every effort to get the National Task Force to come to their rescue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LBS employees who had already begun to believe that the man had contracted the virus were scared to death but the man later got up and began speaking loudly telling the crowd how he had been sick for days and that the Task Force had refused to take him to a health care, isolation or observation center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The performance of the man created a dramatic scene as passers-by and community members, who were greeted by the man who had by then stripped himself naked, crowded the surroundings of the entrance but could not get close to him because he pretended to be desperate to touch anyone stating that he wanted others to die along with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the crowd grew, the performer who took along a Holy Bible began to act as though he were preaching but by then, seven securities at the LBS entrance were all in their hiding places while those watching at the scene were at a distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, some individuals believed to be his relative arrived on the scene and grabbed him by the arms and without saying a word to anyone took him away; it was several minutes after the incident subsided that the health team led by the Director on Ebola, Tolbert Nyenswuah arrived on the scene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margibi County Health Team has trained 40 community health volunteers to assist in curtailing the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this paper recently, the District Health Officer of Kakata, Larry Boahndao said a guest from Uganda through the World Health Organization is visiting the county to train volunteers in controlling the transmission of the virus and contact tracing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boahndao noted that the volunteers will be tracing people who came in contact with infected people; be it alive or dead, in order for the county health team to monitor them systematically for the period of 2- 21-days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the training targeted people from the affected communities in the county and how to trace and monitor people who come in contact with infected people for the 2-21-days period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that for the tracing to be effective, they have planned on reopening C.H. Rennie Hospital which is the only Government's referral hospital in the county explaining how many people are dying in the various communities from different conditions because of the closure of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that the hospital is closed as the result of the fear of Ebola and its reaction. Mr. Boahndao added that they have totally abandoned the hospital due to the lack of equipment and supports adding, &quot;We cannot continue dying as health workers while serving the nation; we cannot do well for the nation in that manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He maintained that when the hospital reopens, the health workers will continue to use the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to detect malaria, diarrhea and other cases as they were given to them by the government through the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boahndao also said the only ambulance the hospital has is being used to transport Ebola patients to ELWA Hospital and appealed to the county authority and the government to provide additional ambulances to be used by the hospital to transport other patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said to reopen the hospital; the health team will have to disinfect the entire facility for three days. It can be recalled that the hospital was shut down after 22 health workers contracted the virus out of which 14 have died with 8 at the ELWA treatment unit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Water in the Desert Assembly in Brewerville last Sunday celebrated 16 years of holistic Church Ministry and eleven years of peace in the Republic of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With theme: 'Lord We Are Grateful', and scriptural text taken from Luke 17:11-19, the Church offered Thanksgiving Prayer to God for families, the Church and the nation for keeping Liberia in peace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Thanksgiving sermon was delivered by Rev. Samuel Quire, Special Assistant to the Bishop of the Liberia Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church and he used his theme, &quot;He who receives a Divine Grace needs to be thankful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Methodist prelate said that through his observation he has learned that God is very close to Liberia, but yet Liberians are very far from God; stating that Liberians have always complained about their leaders but they have refused to change from their old attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where are Liberians today after their cries unto God to deliver them during the war; all you can see is the multiplication of video clubs and night clubs. Now that the deadly Ebola is here, we are once again coming back to God for deliverance; we are very hard to learn,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prelate warned Liberians to be very careful how they handle national problems, stating that the country is sitting on a time bomb waiting to explode, adding, &quot;There are some young people in this country who are gearing up for any problem that will spark up for them to loot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Quire provided hope for believers when he quoted Psalm 50: 6 upward stating that all that Christians need is to offer thanks and praises to God and call on Him to have mercy, and then He will deliver them from all pestilence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded his sermon by calling on Liberians to call on God for mercy at which time he instructed the congregation to lie prostrate on the floor to call on God to deliver Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pastor of the New Water in the Desert Assembly, Dr. Kortu Brown thanked the congregation for having a successful anniversary and contributing to the 'Feed My Sheep' Program initiated by the Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on all Churches in Liberia to give back to the community most especially during this time of the outbreak of a deadly virus called Ebola and said that it is not only enough to spread the Ebola message to the communities when the people are not being fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not only Ebola killing people right now; people are hungry therefore it is time that the Church fulfills her social responsibility to the community,&quot; Rev. Brown stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Brown also warned Liberians to do away with electing people into power who practice homosexualism and said it is against God's will that a man marries another man while a woman marries another woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Water in The Dessert Assembly was founded in 1998 and is the Headquarter Church of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church Int'l.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torrential rains towed down Monrovia and its environs as the death toll in Liberia's worst health epidemic rises. Health workers in protective gears seem overwhelmed by repeated calls from communities about the bodies of suspected ebola victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears loom in the beleaguered city as the poverty stricken people are petrified by the scourge of a virus that seems to have shown its penultimate onslaught on the country's scattered health system. The death toll is beyond 270, and there's no indication when this will end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Liberians believe that their government is unable to deal with the mammoth cases of suspected ebola cases and deaths across the country, unless a massive international rescue mission takes over the situation, there would be a human catastrophe before the end of the ebola war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization says it would take about six months to contain the virus that already taken the lives over 1,000 persons in the West African sub region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rain, the bodies of a number of suspected Ebola victims were discovered in Brewerville and other parts of the city. Residents in Brewerville reportedly set road blocks in their community due to the delay of the Health Ministry response team to remove ebola bodies in their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents told The NEWS that some of the bodies in and around Monrovia may not necessarily be ebola victims but instead some of these bodies might be people who died from other causes, but the fear of ebola and the warning from health officials not to touch dead bodies have triggered fright in the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports that 17 suspected ebola patients and some confirmed Ebola patients escaped an isolation center late Saturday, August 16, 2014 in West Point, a densely populated slump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Frontpageafrica, news about the escape of the 17 suspected ebola patients and those already confirmed, were revealed by Sam Tarplah, a registered nurse who is managing the self-initiative isolation center in west point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tarplah said the suspected Ebola patients escaped from a concrete fence and a building with half transparent windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, there were 29 persons that the center had registered but nine had died over the last few days. A day ago, he claimed that one of the patients who were very weak, fell on his forehead and died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on Friday, a lady from Bardnersville who brought food for her husband and a son, two of them Ebola positive, became angry when she was not allowed entry and as such some residents of West Point, assisted her in erecting sticks on the wall of the fence where the man and his son used to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, there are growing concerns over the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare's handling of the Ebola virus, heightening fears that the virus could spread faster than expected across the country. It is not known which community the escapees are currently residing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Nigerian daily reported Saturday that 4,000 bottles of 'holy water' were taken to Sierra Leone on a chatter flight cost US$50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TB Joshua disclosed minutes before ministering to foreign visitors on his phone-based 'Prayer Line' service that he had already send the 'holy water' to Sierra Leone as promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the renowned Nigerian preacher said he would send 'holy water' to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the three West African nations that have been hard hit by the ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anointing water can also heal problems including infertility and tumors, Joshua claims. It is distributed through his church, the Synagogue Church of All Nations, which is based in the Nigerian capital, Lagos and holds meetings online and on the phone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers were seen restricting the crowd movement when the official vehicle of the Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) lawmaker was parked on the edge of the road next to his colleague District #8 lawmaker, Acarous Gray's vehicle that was initially parked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker furiously disembarked the vehicle and approached the police officer with his finger pointed at the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to eyewitnesses, the lawmaker threatened to slap the officer in his face if he had spoken a word to him. The lawmaker was earlier warned by his colleague, Acarous Gray when he furiously disembarked his vehicle and was moving towards to officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Rep. George was later held from slapping the officer and was taken from the scene toward his vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. George is known for his emotional outburst in public. It can be recalled that Representative George threatened to Slap Journalist Malcolm Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also on record threatening to defecate on Madam Mary Broh in public during a town hall meeting in the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Representative George threatened to dump suspected Ebola bodies in front of the Foreign Affairs Ministry so that Ebola would infect President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf because the Taskforce is bent on delaying to remove dead bodies from his district in West Point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Callaghan, the leader of USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Liberia has disclosed that the fight against the deadly Ebola virus requires global effort.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Callaghan told a news conference Wednesday at the United States Embassy in Monrovia that one country cannot fight the Ebola epidemic alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the United States Government is stepping up efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, Mr. Callaghan noted, is a whole-of-government coordinated approach to help affected countries deal with an unprecedented crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no one country can do it alone. Fighting Ebola is also a global effort requiring effort and commitment by the entire international community and affected West African countries,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that there are approximately 15 people on his team from different U.S. Government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.S. Forest Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that the team deployed here on August 5 is overseeing the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are coordinating closely with our CDC colleagues like Satish Pillar, working around the clock, seven days a week to help respond to the outbreak,&quot; he told a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Callaghan explained that DART would coordinate key areas of the response on behalf of the entire U.S. Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working in support of the Liberian government to do a number of things including the procuring of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other health supplies for healthcare workers in coordination with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of Liberia,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the team would also be involved with the training of local healthcare workers on how to properly use the medical equipment as well as offer trainings to communities and families on how to detect Ebola symptoms and prevent the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. Government is also providing resources to help fight the spread of Ebola. Since the Ebola outbreak was first reported in March 2014, USAID alone has committed more than $14.5 million for the response,&quot; he disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US$14.5 million, he noted, has been used to provide more PPE, health supplies, field laboratories, training, and public service messaging campaigns, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the news conference, Satish Pillai, a medical officer at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reiterated that the outbreak is the 'largest Ebola epidemic in history'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assured that the US Government will stand by Liberia to bring the situation under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pillai said no one can predict how long an outbreak like the current Ebola outbreak will last.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Attack By angry mob on a center structured to quarantine suspected Ebola patients in the densely populated community of West Point on Saturday, August 16, 2014 should tell us that there are loopholes in government approach in handling the Ebola crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There Are Conflicting reports over the fate of 17 suspected Ebola patients who escaped from the center during the mob action. Their whereabouts which are unknown puts the citizenry in a precarious condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody Thought That this would have happened and the danger it poses to the already frightened population cannot be imagined. Some of the individuals who escaped from the center are infected already, and they have mixed with others who apparently don't know their status. It makes the fight against Ebola extremely arduous and portrays some kind of weakness on the side of the task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah said after the attack, 29 patients at the centre were being relocated and readmitted to an Ebola treatment centre located at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center. However, Jina Moore, a journalist for Buzzfeed who is in Monrovia told the BBC that 10 people had been freed by their relatives on Friday, August 15, 2014 and 17 had escaped during the looting the next day. Rebecca Wesseh, who witnessed the attack, told the AFP news agency: &quot;They broke down the door and looted the place. The patients have all gone.&quot; She said the crowd entered the grounds of the Ebola isolation center and looted the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It Is Sad that the incident happened, however, the government should learn from this situation and put in place measures that would ensure maximum security at isolation centers. Much is expected from the government task force in terms of policies, strategies and effectiveness of ensuring that the Ebola fight is sustained and that what transpired last Saturday is not repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, Stringent Security measures must be put in place at hospitals, clinics and all Ebola treatment centers to prevent individuals flouting certain rules that risk human health. It is important for security men to be posted at health facilities where Ebola patients are treated to prevent family members who still doubt the existence of Ebola from intruding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents condemned the vandalization of the Ebola isolation center recently established in the Township by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claimed that the act was carried out by 'misguided' individuals who do not mean well for the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ernest Tweh who spoke on behalf of the residents said stakeholders from various communities in the Township regret the act and called on the government not to neglect them in the wake of the attack on the Ebola isolation center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the leadership of the Township has set up a committee to conduct an investigation and prosecute perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the residents have urged the government to continue normal operations in the Township, including the resumption of activities at the Zone Two Police depot which was closed in the wake of the August 16, 2014 unfortunate incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the closure of the depot has exposed the population of the Township to potential security threat leaving them in fear of contacting Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the residents have alarmed about the presence of four dead bodies in the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called on the government to immediately take delivery of the bodies so as to avoid health hazard in the area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia says additional drastic measures are needed in Monrovia to curtail the continuous spread of the dreadful Ebola virus in the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister Lewis Brown said Montserrado County, mainly Monrovia remains a serious challenge to fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday at the Ministry of Information debut Ebola press briefing in Monrovia, the MICAT boss said the government, through the Ebola Taskforce was working on additional measures to reduce the increased transmission of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said unlike Guinea and Sierra Leone, the government of Liberia is being challenged in fighting the deadly virus in its densely populated capital city. Liberia has an estimated population of nearly 4 million with Monrovia constituting about 970,824 people as of the 2008 census, amounting to 29% of the total population of the country and is considered as the country's most populous city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MICAT boss said at least 233 suspected, probable and confirmed new cases were recorded in Montserrado County, mainly Monrovia over the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said government is encouraging community leaders to support the establishment of holding centers in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown said this will help the government in ensuring that individuals suspected of the virus and other fevers are kept under observation before being released or sent for further treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf got her second mandate from the Liberian people in 2011, she was under obligation to ensure that the aspirations of the people are met. Unlike the first term, which was practically good; although certain development goals were not met, by and large most Liberians believe that the President's performance was better than now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It Is Difficult to understand why the socioeconomic condition of the country is declining. The living conditions of Liberians are appalling, foreign businesses are rapidly scaling down their operations amid the spread of the Ebola virus. The Liberian economy was predicted to increase by 5.9% this year, but considering the current state of affairs - with government having limited resources to fight Ebola and address other critical development issues -economists believe that it would be difficult to get 3% by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola Crisis has and will seriously impact the economy, especially when the government lacks sufficient resources to deal with all of the mammoth problems at once. In spite of all of what we are going through as a nation and people, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf continues to suggest that the &quot;Iron Lady&quot; Liberian knew is beginning to show lack of efficacy in dealing with her officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Week, The President gave her officials who are abroad to return in one week or face dismissal. One week has since expired on Monday, and there are indications that some of her officials are still abroad. The President has taken no decision yet, and it is uncertain whether she intends to penalize those who violated her order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Very Issue has been raised by Darius Dillon, a confidante of the President, who said since the president instructed her officials to return home within one week; that one week expired and nothing has been done to them. Dillon says some of her officials are still out of Liberia, but she is yet to act against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dillon's Statement Is an indication that these officials take the president for granted because they know when she says one thing, she does another. Liberians are resilient people, but they are not happy with the way the president is handling the affairs of state and her officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Believe That the President is right to demand her officials who are abroad to return home. She cannot be fighting Ebola and struggling to address other state matters while her officials are on safari; it is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Know That the President has always protected her officials whether they are wrong or right. We recall couple of months ago, when the government was in pursuit for Ellen Corkrum, the former managing director of the Roberts International Airport (who secretly recorded some government officials, including the president), it was some of the very officials who aided her to escape the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, When Her officials are behaving in this manner, we are not surprise. Madam President must match her words with actions or else she will be viewed as a president who pretends to be serious about what she says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">631 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been quite a while when we last tendered you a memo. We thought there were so many pressing things on the docket of yours which we wanted to allow you tend to before bothering you with our editorial opinions. But today, the imperative for tendering you a memo is made urgent by your invocation of Article 86 of our organic law, the Constitution, relative to the State of Emergency declared. This is not an ordinary exercise of presidential prerogative; it is a serious--a rare--national declaration. This is so not only because our Constitution, which the declaration fractures, finds its beauty and substance in the virtues of freedom, liberty and liberation, but also because you came to Liberia's national leadership with high inclination to radically break from the nation's past replete with subjugation and cheat. There is no guarantee that under a state of emergency you or your government can claim these values unscathed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though many Liberians, even including us, may disagree with the imposition of a state of emergency, we are compelled to accept because perhaps there are no better options. Ebola is raging. Ignorance, carelessness, arrogance and doubtfulness are all combined composts providing fertility to the galloping spread of the epidemic. To further compound the situation, our national capacity, particularly the health sector, is rudimentary and totally weedy and fragile to contain the ferocity of the Ebola virus. As infections and accompanying deaths increase, so is pervasive fear amongst the population. Nearly everyone gives up and national disorder is potentially setting in. As the pilot in charge of this national voyage, you see power gradually slipping out of your hands and you cannot afford it slip completely. You therefore have risen to take charge of things; to keep the nation, including the prevailing health crisis, governable. We agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Madam President, a state of emergency also comes with other costs. It's not just inputs a cost to the economy, as the private sector is bound to sink into the much-abhorred and much-feared state of uncertainty, but also a cost on the rights and freedoms of people for which Government was primarily established to protect. Human rights and human freedoms are God-given; one has them because they are born. Human rights can neither be rationed like relief items nor taken away. Paradoxically, the Constitution provides for state of emergency and in essence subjects these God-given rights to rationing by just a single citizen, the President. And we also agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Your Excellency, you have your own legacy to protect. In fact, you ascended to the erstwhile people-feared presidency with a promise to make presidential powers congenial. And your hard work to keep this promise has earned you the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize and other coveted international accolades. These merited earnings can be ruined by the State of Emergency, and can cause you to leave the Liberian presidency as others before you did--leaving behind unpleasant histories. We think this can also befall you because a state of emergency converts democratic, civil governance into an arbitrary and excessive political order. It is maintained not by civil structures built by the apparatuses of state trained and programmed to dispense brutality, coercion and extortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our Liberian situation marred by state apparatuses already ingrained with, and having a long history of, barbarism, a state of emergency is expected to be maximized in all furies and with all its inborn anti-freedom and anti-rights traits. Without being indifferent or opposed to stern measures against Ebola, this is our qualm. And we hope you will take note as the nation cruises through the state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for your attention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">945 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIKE KING SOLOMON of Bible times, many opine that age doesn't matter--necessarily. They exalt wisdom as the moral cloud that must be cherished over the number of birth anniversaries one has acquired, and celebrated. True. But age is the basic centerpiece of knowledge. In fact, it is a basic barometer by which one's worth or merit is measured. That is why an elder receives more censure when he errs than the young. Like a fine metal or diamond that gets its purity or refinement by the hearth or fire, man's true caliber arrives from life's journey--age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT DECADE AND six, The Analyst stands on the judgment seat of the public--both Liberian and international readerships--since we run print and online editions. But whatever is in the figment of any reader, our age, which clicked at 16, has not only been a checkered existence, but also a grandiose hope for formidability on the media landscape of this country. The Analyst, fondly called the Nation's Most Analytical Newspaper, was born on the island of tumult, sailed on turbulent seas even before it celebrated its third anniversary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY, AS WE quietly observe the passing of our 16th Anniversary, we do so with deep, sober reflection not only of the checkered past, an eager eye on the current trends of the national business and a high determination to enter the future with greater dedication, but also with a heavy heart as the nation endures the hurt and carnage that the Ebola virus has inflicted upon this country. Amid it all, we can assure our many readers and admirers that we will not walk alone, just as we usually been, but invokes God's healing mercy on the nation and its neighbors also suffering similar health emergency situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE gracious partnership we have had with the Liberian people--their trust, support and counsel--without which we certainly would have joined dozens of our compatriots who only flashed on the horizon and withered away. This is why our hearts are broken at this time of health emergency because these partners--national and international--with whom we should have shared our joy and celebration are irked and beleaguered by a pandemic not showing any sign of receding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS WE TODAY celebrate because with the blurred beam of light we see from the shores of media freedom in this country, and an ultimate defeat and end of the Ebola conflagration over this nation, may True God of our Fathers guide us prevail over the challenges of the nation. In line with our mission to inform, educate and entertain--to trumpet the voice of the commoners--we promise to do all within our power and limited resources to continue and widen our campaign of information and awareness and enlightening on the Ebola virus. This is the vocation for which we were born and for which in difficult political times we were deeply bruised and crucified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURING THE OVER decade and a half of existence, we endure calamities. Our offices were summarily shut down and our equipment seized several times without a warrant. We were called all kinds of names: agent provocateurs; enemies of government; paid agents; rebel accomplices, etc. Most of our staff, including the Publisher/Managing Editor, were rounded up and thrown in a common jail on mere police suspicion. In all of these, we were like sheep being taken to the slaughterhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT 16, WE forget not that the public, particularly our loyal readers who constitute the bulwark and fortress around which our triumph is anchored. When we were only eight pages, one-time and later three-time weekly and logistics-starving, it was the encouragement of readers, the prayers of well-wishers and few nickels and dimes of admirers that fastened the buckles that kept us in grips on the newsstand. Moreover, in the face of adversity--when the political regime under which we rose to the newsstand regarded and treated us like a sworn armed adversary, we depended upon the public, second to God the Almighty, to hummock us out of danger and console us, and even to fight our case when physically and psychologically preyed upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THOUGH THE SIRLEAF Administration is yet to prove itself akin to the regimes of the dark days of the past when the Liberian media, specifically The Analyst, hungered for free expression and free press, we don't bask in the illusion of final freedom to slack the bond of camaraderie with the public. On this 16th Anniversary, therefore, we solemnly renew our covenant with the people of this country for whom, after all, we got our birth, and for whom we have become willing preys of official lashes. The journey we have embarked upon is timeless and regimeless. As we said in our maiden editorial, the mindset and conviction that drove our rise on the media terrain is to serve and keep the public trust, to support and ally with those who strive to build a better Liberia based on the pillars of freedom, justice, equality and patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN OUR CELEBRATION today, we are not consumed by the euphoria of ululation and the joy of the day, nor are we amused and carried away from the so-called improved media environment. We shall remain a vanguard of the voiceless ordinary people of Liberia. We shall remain a paragon of professionalism, objectivity and an instrument of peace and development. We shall never waver in the face of intimidation even with guns at our chest. This is exactly why we celebrate today; because we stood the test of time in the darkest of days because God, our Great Benefactor and the people of Liberia, our cherished constituents, were with us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE SALUTE AND THANK you all for your support and pray that our nation will triumph over Ebola and all the advertises of recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">God bless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1229 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groggy with the fanfare of our anniversary celebration, but reflective and sober of the reality of the day, including the Ebola-made misery befallen upon our country, we bring not flowers to you on this day, but our earnest advice on a very pivotal element of national governance, the media, and what we candidly think you must, do not only to keep a better relationship with the Liberian media, but also act consistent with constitutional dictates of free speech, free press and other human freedoms. While we acknowledge you and everyone else are preoccupied with efforts to curtail Ebola, we are compelled to leave you with this subject of this memo during the observance of our 16th anniversary because this Ebola storm will certainly pass over and since this moment comes to us every 12 long months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, let us say, Madam President, that when you took the oath of office on 16 January 2006, you made a number of elating statements and vows, amongst which is the pledge to protect media freedom as a foundation for sustainable peace and development. It is not difficult to say why you promised to uphold press freedom and why you tried to minimally make a difference from the regimes of your predecessors: your much-vaunted 40-year political struggle was underpinned by a strong support from the media. And you fiercely agitated against your predecessors who saw the press as a launching pad of opposition agenda. Some media people and organizations took bruises because they trumpeted your views and bolstered your popularity and relevance in the Liberian political mosaic. You are therefore under moral obligation, and bounded by Constitutional imperatives, to go the extra mile and demonstrate significant differences in your free expression policy and commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading of the history of your struggle vi's-&agrave;-vis the role of the media in it, much is expected from you. You have often advocated that press freedom is the mother of all freedoms. We recall President George W. Bush awarded you the coveted award of Freedom, for your &quot;personal courage and unwavering commitment to expand freedom... in Liberia and across Africa.&quot; Many have recognized you as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To whom much is given, much is expected. Thus, you stand morally obliged, now as President of Liberia, to vanguard the cause of freedom of the press than any other Liberian President. That expectation, as far as the history of your struggle is concerned, is not comparatively satisfactory. Independent media watchdog groups, located here and abroad, have found your regime wanting of the full respect for media freedom. Research reports published indicate untold unfavorable actions--harassment, brutality, prejudice, malice--against media people and organizations. Harsh media laws, including &quot;criminal malevolence&quot;, are still on the books. Lamentations triggered by asphyxiating taxes on media-related goods have gone unheeded. Some &quot;regime unfriendly&quot; media groups are complaining of exclusion from certain state functions and bias in advertisement distribution by loyal or partisan officials and public institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More besides, Madam President, your government owes media entities in huge advertisement debts. The other day, the Ministry of Finance introduced the disadvantageous &quot;Golden Handshake&quot; scheme which only treated the symptoms of the problem and left the root causes. In the last couple of months, the advertisement debts have exceedingly ballooned and every media organization in the country is burdened--burdened without attention from your government. This is a bloodless decapitation of the media and it speaks volumes about your relationship with them also. Even with the national emergency caused by Ebola, the media remain critically impaired to play its role which is indispensable in the fight against the pandemic. We hope the emergency would mark the turning point in defraying your government's indebtedness to media and ease the burden so that we play our rightful play during this emergency and long after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Madam President, if Liberian media ever deserve kingly treatment at any time in their existence, that time is under your administration. You are a longtime partner in the search for plural and freer society. They lamented the thirst for freedom, particularly media freedom. And more so, you are, or profess to be, a Constitutionalist, a religious observer of the Constitution. You therefore certainly know that the pages of the Constitution bear bundles of political, social and economic freedoms, amongst which Article 15 which lavishly provides and protects the rights of Liberians to be informed, educated and enlightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police brutality, official hatred (covert or overt), killer tax regime on media goods, scathing official criticisms and other notable disposition of your administration towards the Liberian media must be discontinued if you are to maintain and merit the epithet of &quot;protector of human freedom&quot; for which many find your regime culpable. If you don't understand the background from which our anniversary memo derives its focus, get a copy of publications on attacks on Liberian media by local and international organizations such as the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building and Freedom House respectively. There are bundles of violations ranging from SSS and other presidential military units' excesses against the media, police brutality, intimidation, harassment and scathing verbal censures of the media by officials of government representing the three Branches of Government. There is no report of punitive or disciplinary action against victimizers of media people under your administration just as it had been in the days of old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are held in esteem for your administration to take such a drift. As the past holds it to you to live by what you preached, and the present now sifters your rhetoric, the future will bring upon you the final judgment on how history should remember you. You must endeavor to find your place on the good side of history: a true forerunner of free press and free speech. This calls for the end of complacency and self-confidence on what is perceived to be improved media environment under your administration. That no journalist is in physical prison is no better than journalists languishing in the cells of &quot;unfriendly media&quot; appellation or in the furnace of advertisement discrimination and high taxes on exported media materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We thought to provide you this counsel on our anniversary because our reflection on this day brings out the postulation that your administration stands a perfect possibility and chance to end the long night of captivity which the media have threaded over the years. The dawn sparked by your ascendency to state power is not yet turned into day for the genuine free press as envisaged by the Constitution of Liberia. The break of sunny day for the media, for free press and free speech, is not long, though it is not automatic. It depends on your deliberate and forceful demonstration of the political will. You see the unprecedented support the media have been giving since the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. This is an expression of patriotism and good relations. This needs to be harnessed and promoted even after the virus is repelled and the nation return of normal. We are therefore hopeful you need this counsel of ours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for your time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the National Task Force on Ebola, anytime from now, announces the last infected person healed or dead, with no additional cases emerging afterwards, Liberia would sigh a huge relief from the virus' nightmarish devastation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Ebola-related deaths would have come to an end, it would not be the end of the trouble for Liberia. Pundits are predicting that the devastated population would then be awakened to an equally ruinous crisis--a biting economic crisis, which if not managed would result into political crisis. And the roots of those crises have begun to form right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The postwar country's largest investor, Arcelormittal, is parking out of here and there are signs that other major concessionaries would soon be freezing their jobs-underpinning operations, as The Analyst's Edward Palmer reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the evolving situation of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, contractors working on the phase 2 expansion project of ArcelorMittal have declared force majeure and are moving out of the country, according to a communication given in this paper on Monday by the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ArcelorMittal's Chief Executive Officer for Mining, Bill Scotting, said while the termination of contracts for several companies sub- contracting for Arcelor Mittal is taking effect, the priority for Liberia and any other affected countries right now is to contain and ultimately stop the current outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are providing full support to the government in this regard and taking every precaution to protect all of our employees on the ground in Liberia&quot;, he added. Mr. Scotting assured that ArcelorMittal has made a long-term commitment to Liberia and that the company will maintain this commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging that the recent developments are very alarming, Mr. Scotting noted that at present, the company's management believes that the emergency procedures and other measures developed and currently in place at all ArcelorMittal sites in Liberia make it possible to continue phase one of their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia, ArcelorMittal has taken every precaution to protect its employees and operations, including providing thermo flash scanners to test for fever in all employees and visitors to all ArcelorMittal Liberia locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Scotting added that 500 full sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) have already been distributed to ArcelorMittal hospitals and other hospitals and clinics in Nimba, Buchanan, and training has been provided to health care workers and employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola awareness sessions were conducted by a leading Ebola prevention and control expert, and an infectious disease nurse has been brought in who serves as the company's in house expert that is now working closely with ArcelorMittal hospital team, Mr. Scotting confided through his communications. ArcelorMittal is currently mining and shipping 5 million tons of ore a year in Liberia from its operations in Yekepa and Buchanan described as Phase one of its operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIKE every other medic trying to fight the spread of west Africa's deadly Ebola outbreak, Dr Melvin Korkor knows the importance of reassuring a panicking public. Despite its high fatality rate, and the belief that it is the work of witchcraft, his message is that victims may well pull through if they are treated early enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he tells that to fellow Liberians, one thing gives him a unique credibility. For not only did Dr Korkor come down with Ebola himself recently, he survived.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spoke to The Daily Telegraph at Phebe Hospital in Liberia's remote Bong County, where an outbreak last month saw him and five nurses rushed to an isolation unit in the capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus had hit the hospital after a woman suffering diarrhoea came in for treatment, lying about the fact that she was from neighbouring Lofa County, where the Ebola outbreak has been at its worst. By the time she died three days later, it was too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some of the nurses who had treated her had come down with a high fever,&quot; said Dr Korkor, 42, who is now on three months' leave. &quot;They were tested for Ebola and confirmed positive. I knew I had had interaction with the patient and the nurses, and so I asked for one of my blood samples to be sent for testing too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His worst fears were confirmed. But Dr Korkor knew that, while the virus has a mortality rate of 60 to 90 per cent, those who treat the symptoms early - a matter of keeping the body well-watered and nourished - improve their survival chances. &quot;I asked for an ambulance to take me to Monrovia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then I told my wife get me a Bible and nothing else. She started to cry, but I told her 'no crying, I am coming back'.&quot; On arrival at Monrovia's Elwa Hospital, he was assessed at a sealed unit, where medics wear boiler suits, goggles and masks, and checked into the bed of a patient who had just died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As many around him failed, he put his faith in scripture as well as medicine, reading Psalm 91 from his Bible, which refers to how God will protect his followers from &quot;noisome pestilence&quot; and &quot;any plague come nigh thy dwelling&quot;. Four days in, he was tested again. It was negative. &quot;It was like being reborn,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his discharge, he returned to Bong County, where he found other people avoiding him &quot;like the plague&quot;. As he told a local radio station: &quot;Thanks to God, I am cured. But now I have a new disease: the stigmatisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this sort of public misunderstanding that he is trying to correct, aware that the more fear and ignorance surrounds Ebola, the more it will spread. It has already claimed more than 1,000 lives in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. &quot;The only reason I survived is because I went to get help earlier,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to tell the world that Ebola is real. If you start to feel ill, get tested straightaway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinic raid Patients flee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's effort to combat the Ebola outbreak suffered a blow yesterday when armed men looted a quarantine centre and its patients went on the run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The facility in Monrovia, the capital, was stormed by gunmen who alleged that the epidemic had been faked by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outcome was that bloodstained sheets and mattresses - all potentially infected with the virus - were taken and previously quarantined patients simply disappeared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has urged governments not to impose blanket bans on trade and travel on Ebola-affected countries after Kenya joined a growing number of countries and airlines severing links to three west African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO has already said that the risk of Ebola transmission from air travel is low, but the level of fear is so high that several airlines have disregarded the advice. The disease has already killed at least 1,145 people across west Africa this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The scale of the outbreak is much larger than anything ever seen before,&quot; said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the UN's public health arm. &quot;It is an obvious source of concern and it is not to be underestimated, but we must take measures commensurate with the risk. What you don't want to do is to take blanket measures to cut off travel and trade.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya is the latest country to jump on the bandwagon by declaring a travel ban on Saturday. From midnight tomorrow, people travelling from or through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia will not be allowed to enter the east African country, said Kenya's health ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, which allows entry to health professionals and Kenyans returning from those countries, was not included in the ban. The outbreak began in the forested zone on the borders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia earlier this year, and spread to Nigeria last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO last week said the outbreak had been vastly underestimated and will require &quot;extraordinary measures, on a massive scale&quot; to contain it. Medecins sans Frontieres, the medical charity, said the disease was spreading &quot;faster than we can respond to (it)&quot;, and accused the WHO of being too slow to react.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Kenyan government's decision, Kenya Airways said it would suspend flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone, abruptly reversing its announcement on Friday that it would continue flying to those countries. The airline had been accused by medical experts and Kenyan politicians of putting profits ahead of prudence amid fears that its flights would spread the virus. The airline flies more than 70 flights a week to west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's chief executive, Titus Naikuni, had argued at a news conference on Friday that its flights helped to contain the Ebola outbreak by transporting medical staff, supplies and equipment to west Africa. But doctors representing the Kenya Medical Association asked Kenya Airways to suspend flights to the four countries affected &quot;until things stabilise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several airlines have already suspended flights to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, including British Airways, Emirates Airlines, Arik Air and Asky Airlines. Nigeria became the fourth Ebola-affected country after a Liberian-American man flew to Lagos on an Asky flight and infected several people in the city before he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Cameroon, which borders Nigeria, announced on Friday that it would suspend flights from Ebola-affected countries. Korean Air announced on Thursday it would halt services to Kenya despite there being no cases in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartl said action commensurate with the risk of Ebola spreading through air travel had already been taken in the three most-affected countries: the screening of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes sense at the departure end and there is nothing to stop screening at the incoming end. These are much better measures. You do not need a sledgehammer to crack a nut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screening involves visual observations and asking passengers questions such as whether they have had known contact with Ebola cases and whether they feel ill or feverish. Hartl pointed out that the Liberian-American who died in quarantine in Lagos had left before screening was in place. But screening in his case might not have worked as he had left with no symptoms, and only reported feeling unwell on arrival in Lagos.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the ceremony held at the National Drug Service, UNFPA-Liberia Assistant Representative, Dr. Philderald Pratt said the assorted items are to be shared with other medical institutions to enable pregnant women get the rightful treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, this will ensure that the health workers are protected and to make sure that they stay on the job and take care of those who are in need.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Pratt mentioned that UNFPA will support the Ministry of Health in every way they see fit to contain the Ebola virus and make sure that Liberians and Liberia be free of this virus and hoped that with the assorted items being shared with other medical facilities will encourage health workers to return to work and save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the assorted items, the Director of Family Health Division at the Ministry of Health, Dr. CuallauJabbeh-Howe thanked UNFPA and said that the donation cannot be overemphasized because it is timely as mothers are dying every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the items will help medical officers save mothers and contain the deadly Ebola virus and emphasized that the Ebola virus is very deadly and most health workers who do not have protective gears find it difficult to stay on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jabbeh-Howe said it is true that pregnant women are dying of safe delivery but with the protective gears, there is hope that they will have safe delivery while at the same time she thanked UNFPA for going beyond and caring for the people and medical officers of Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several residents in West Point were seen on Saturday looting the West Point Hospital ahead of fear that the Government of Liberia was planning to establish another Ebola Center in the area. Currently, ELWA hosts the only Ebola Center in Montserrado County, but the residents feared that building the center in the area was going to increase the spreading of the deadly virus in the already jammed packed community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Point, which is situated right at the center of Monrovia, serves as one of the congested communities in Monrovia, dominantly occupied by business people and ordinary residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, when this paper visited the disputed area on Saturday, several persons, including youths, women and elderly men were seen looting the beddings and other medical equipment at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene of the looting which appeared dramatic attracted the attention of ordinary people who stood astounded with disbelief at what was occurring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What kind of people are we as West Point people loot the hospital? This is unbelievable, so when they loot the hospital, what happens if they get sick? This behavior should stop and we need to stop this behavior,&quot; a resident stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporters who were on the scene vividly saw several hospital beddings, a big generator, bags containing personal items perhaps for some of the patients or health workers, and several bags of 25kg of parboil rice being looted by the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About three persons were believed to have died and their remains were still in the area. According to residents who preferred anonymity said the death of the people was unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resident further explained that since the community residents including family members of the deceased persons called on the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare including the Ebola Response Unit with no positive response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents said they have called on the health officials concerning previous deaths that occurred which the Health or Ebola response officials have not told them the root-cause of the death of these persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident explained that a pastor in the area, John Kargba who visited the West Point Hospital to seek medical attention after he felt ill with fever, returned home helpless after health officials at the West Point Hospital sprayed the vicinity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the residents, Pastor John Kargba instantly died at the threshold of his house upon his return from the hospital thereby making three dead bodies in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, another pastor was mysteriously found dead in his home in Paynesville and according to eye witnesses; Pastor Eric Gorden was seen lying dead at his Duport Road residence on Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources also said that Pastor Gorden previously lived in the area with his family prior to his demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, angry residents on Saturday took the wife of the pastor for questioning at the police station in Paynesville.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These new facilities will be able to host more than 200 confirmed patients at once and will still have space for suspected cases and those who might be tested negative even though they were once tested positive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing the press on Sunday at a joint press conference, WHO Country Representative, Dr. Nester Ndayimirije, Liberia's Assistant Minister for Preventive Services at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Tolbert Nyenswah said they had to construct these new isolation centers in order to decongest the present center at ELWA and take in new cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nester Ndayimirije said at least 50 health workers have volunteered to work at the JFK isolation center which will operate on three shifts. He said it is not enough to keep opening isolation centers; Liberians need to know how to prevent the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part,Minister Nyenswah said the government was doing all health good to adequately respond to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, especially after the revamping of the incident management system for Ebola response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they have been struggling in the past weeks with space of where to admit Ebola patients and mentioned that they now have 120-bed capacity for treating Ebola patients at ELWA-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Minister for Preventive Services stressed that ELWA-2 in the same compound of the ELWA Hospital, now hosts 77 patients and also disclosed that ELWA-3 which has the capacity of 120 beds at the moment, will be expanded to 300 beds in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the isolated centers at John F. Kennedy (JFK) medical center in Sinkor has 35 beds and can be stretched to at most 45 beds. Dr. Atai Omoruoto, who is a Ugandan medical practitioner, has been hired by WHO to help with the situation in Liberia by running the refurbished and extended Ebola center at JFK along with a team of Ugandan medical practitioners including two doctors and seven nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Omoruoto, the present trend of the disease, the Ebola virus might still be around up to December. At the same time, at least 20 persons died Thursday night at ELWA-2 isolation center. It has long been said by Medicins San Frontier (MSF) and other international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) that the Ebola virus is still claiming lives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I have repeated in two articles about rumor-mongering that what is difficult in this kind of communication, commonly referred to as the GRAPEVINE, is the tracing of the origin of the source of a piece of rumor, that would usually spread rapidly from one person to another. It is such that as it leaves from one person to another, there is always the possibility of its being garbled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ugly situation of rumor-mongering was experienced last Thursday when it was rumored in parts of the city suburbs that there was shooting by security officers in the city, a situation that caused serious fear and panic to an extent that normal activities in parts of the suburbs of the city, especially in the Duala Market vicinity, were disrupted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the rumor also spread to some areas, including the popular Red Light Market that also caused people to be imbued with fear. First it was said that a mad man attacked a police officer, later it was learned that it was because of the news from Monrovia about the shooting in the city that caused the panic in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news about the reported panic and fear about the rumor of the shooting came to light in the evening when relatives in the Duala areas inquired from their relatives who were in the city, as to what was really happening in the city. They reported how people were running for their lives because it was widely rumored that there was shooting in the city, which may eventually have an effect on them. Therefore, in keeping with the first law of nature, which is self-preservation, they decided to vacate the street to their various homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, as relatives &quot;in town&quot; refuted anything of shooting in the city, those in the Duala areas and other parts, persistently inquired on really what was going on. With disbelief, because of the high level of the rumor, there were still inquiries of this issue of shooting. In some instances, this paper and some of its staffers received numerous calls on the issue. Some called to ask: &quot;What's really happening in the city? They said they are shooting in Monrovia.&quot; The situation was like from one inquiry to another on the matter until &quot;the newspaper went to bed&quot; (sent to the press for printing).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to this Thursday scenario, there was another rumor on Wednesday that police has arrested caskets filled with arms, something that proved the opposite, but as the rumor spread, many person stormed the Zone Three Police Depot to see the arms. Later, it was discovered that the caskets contained two bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be noted here that since the declaration of the state of emergency, the rumor mills have increased. Some said the decision was taken because of security problems facing the country; others said it was taken, not necessarily for the Ebola, because arms have been discovered in some part of the country and that the state of emergency was the only meant to quell any act detrimental to national security. And so, for sometime, rumors have been around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation about rumor in recent times is like this country is sitting on time bomb, because every other day has its own rumor. As one professor said, rumor is what people make of a situation that is, whenever there is a situation, one should expect the spread of rumor, without discovering the source of origin. Yes, the Thursday rumor was what people made of the situation of the number of police officers in the streets to close down the National Chronicle newspaper of Mr. Philipbert Browne. Someone may have interpreted what he or she saw with the presence of the heavily armed police officers and the number of officers sent to carry out the closure of the newspaper to others in Duala in a way that suggested the issue of shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is common, as rumor travels from one person to another or from one channel to another, those who also spread it may likely add or subtract. And so in this particular situation, someone may have misinterpreted the initial rumor to mean shooting, thus, spreading it in a different fashion and manner; something that led to this unnecessary fear and panic last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, besides the spread of the rumor, the presence of the police officers to effect the closure of the newspaper caused lots of panic on Carey Street. That even led to the closure of businesses and the restriction of the movement of people. As a result of that, it was initially speculated that that was all intended to arrest the publisher and managing editor of the newspaper, Mr. Brown. However, later it was gathered that it was all intended to close down the newspaper, whether it was by court order or in line with the State Of Emergency, that stresses the suspension of certain rights, when the need be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me say that this article is not intended to look into the merits and demerits of the closure of the newspaper, as this could be handled later. This piece is intended to look at the decision of whosoever that ordered the police officers, in such a colossal number that moved belligerently to go and close down a newspaper, for whatever reason. The presence and mood of the number of officers, coupled with the disruption of businesses in that part of the city, gave rise to the rumor that came out that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worst of all, the sound that characterized the alleged forceful opening of the offices of the newspaper and the alleged use of teargas that carried sound, may have been taken for the shooting that reached the suburbs of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, I blame those who authorized the method that was used by the police officers only to close down a single newspaper. Why was such number of officers deployed in such combat position, as though they were able to attack a garrison or to quell a situation that threatens national security, thereby bringing about fear in the area, something that led to businesses hurriedly closing down for hours? Was there any threat at the time of the planned closure of the newspaper? I ask these questions because I'm still pondering why such a force that caused unnecessary panic and fear was used?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lest we forget that we are in a crisis situation, with this deadly Ebola claiming the lives of our compatriots. This outbreak has already brought about unnecessary tension and all kinds of rumors, therefore, those in charge of national security, no matter of any planned action, should be very careful and mindful of how they go about in carrying out such actions. Once more the authorizing authorities erred for last Thursday's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with the State Of Emergency, we as a government and people must be mindful of how we go about using force to effect certain actions or decisions. We must beware of what is called &quot;excessive or unnecessary force,' and also consider what is known as the &quot;Proportionality Of Force&quot; in such matter, like last Thursday. Indeed, last Thursday incident was bad public relations for the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, the decision to put such number of police officers in the street in such a belligerent manner and combat gear for the closure of a newspaper was not proper and appropriate. I hope my foster brother Chris Massaquoi, as head of the police and also a lawyer, has taken note of this embarrassment. I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Winnie Saywah-Jimmy</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">515 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Airways, a member of the Sky Team Alliance leading African airlines flying over 60 destinations worldwide has finally complied to temporarily suspend all its commercial flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an operation up-date released by the airline on Saturday, August 16, the airline said the operational decision takes effect on tomorrow, Tuesday August 19 beginning at midnight and said the decision is based on the situation risk assessment of Kenya's Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline expressed regrets to customers booked on the suspended flights for disrupting their travel plans and promised to provide a full refund of all tickets earlier booked and paid for prior to the suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the statement released, the airline said, &quot;As we have indicated before, we are dependent on expert advice for our continued operations from the Ministry of Health and WHO. Kenya wishes to confirm that we will comply with the advice to suspend our commercial flight operations to Liberia and Sierra Leone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of the air transport services during such critical moments remains a crucial component of the outbreak containment and overall management as at the height of the Ebola outbreak, Kenya Airways has remained a key air transport solutions provider which had earlier promised that its door will remain opened to its guests even in countries plagued with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to confirm that Kenya Airways will continue operating all its scheduled flights to Nigeria and Ghana. However, in the interest of public safety for both our esteem guests and staff, we reserve the right to cancel our flights to any other destination should the situation warrant,&quot; Kenya Airways Group Managing Director and CEO, Titus Naikuni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on August 12, Kenya Airways up-date said WHO stated that the risk of a tourist or businessman becoming affected with Ebola virus to visit the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO said according to Kenya Airways the transmission requires direct contact with blood, secretion, organs or other body fluids of infected living or dead persons or animals, all unlikely exposures for the average traveler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The KQ airlines promised to continue to maintain several precautionary measures which included educating all its staff especially those in Liberia and Sierra Leone on Ebola and how it is transmitted and how to keep safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline also supplied and trained its crew members on how to use the Universal Precaution Kits (UPKs) as well as give them up to date briefing before departure and upon arrival back home adding that, &quot;So far, Ebola has not been declared an epidemic or pandemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear in the recent operational up date released if the virus has been declared an epidemic or Liberia and Sierra Leone a no go zone, because its statement of up date released on August 12 said, &quot;Withdrawing our flights to these key destinations given the safeguard already placed by the respective governments and global health authorities would amount to a corporate placement of unnecessary travel advisory.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Working On the Ebola Response Mechanism</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">576 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, we published an editorial, captioned: 'Identifying with the fight against Ebola' in which we, among other things, urged those responsible for receiving and expending funds being donated to ensure proper accountability and at the same time called on the authorities to intensify efforts to create a strategy that will not result to residents resolving to community protests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial at the same time acknowledged the many contributions that are being exerted especially by international partners towards the fight against this deadly virus despite the epidemic is still active in the country. It was also mentioned how everyday several corpses were found at homes or in open places on the streets with community members hopelessly calling on the Ebola Task Force to respond by assisting in removing the dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that editorial published on August 14, we said being cognizant that many persons have begun identifying with the fight of Ebola in the country, it is equally important that the National Task Force use wisely and appropriately the funds and items provided because there were many who are still complaining about the lack of swiftness in getting the National Task Force to respond as expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we continue to call on Liberians to take all preventive measures in curtailing further the spread of the virus across the communities and country in general, we are equally concerned about the wave of deaths and how the Task Force is coordinating itself in tackling this situation especially with the straight instruction that nobody is to touch a dead person or someone suspected of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we continue to thank the Ministry of Health and Social welfare for creating a massive awareness strategy that has brought onboard several national partners including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, National Defense and the National Police with special assistance from the General Services Agency, we are also urging this coordination to beef up a proper Ebola response mechanism that will match the contributions already provided so that the process will attract more assistance if it is to be eradicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we are constrained to reinforce this editorial with a clarion call to the Task Force on its response mechanism component that seems to be very weak because of the heap of hopelessness the community members have expressed in anger by their day-to-day protest action or road blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the mechanism is not coordinated on how to remove the dead from in communities, the disbeliefs by some Liberians will grow and the virus will continue to spread as it is difficult to see a love one die much more to sit and watch their dead body lay in the street or floor of a room without being attended to for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For us, we are convinced that if there is a proper response mechanism established by the Ebola Task Force, the team will be able to quarantine the facility or home as well as remove the dead body on time so that the family members do not get in contact with the person out of anger and there will not be protest from family members or community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We emphatically stated in our previous editorial on this matter that, &quot;to whom much is given, much is expected,&quot; hence, the National Task Force on Ebola must make swift moves into communities where they are called and avoid communities using protest as the only language the government and its task force on Ebola understands. A HINT TO THE WISE IS QUITE SUFFICIENT!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many citizens have denounced the behavior of residents of West Point for ransacking and looting a quarantine center in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Saturday residents of the congested community rejected the Government of Liberia and international partners move to erect the Ebola center in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of their fear and rejection of the center, residents of West Point went on the rampage and looted the facilities that were brought into the area for the treatment of Ebola patients.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many Liberians called the West Pointers' action as a stave in their own back while other believe that residents of the community had lost an opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unbelievable that someone will go into an Ebola Center and take away Mattresses, buckets, rice that was in stock for Ebola Patient, Ebola protective gears some of which were already used. This action will spread Ebola in West Point and I believe this township is now at risk&quot; one health worker told the INQUIRER yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident of West Point(named withheld) said some of the Mattresses that were looted are now in the homes of others or have found their way on the market something which has the propensity to further spread the virus in West Point and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a big damage that is now hanging over the people of Monrovia because white Ebola suits that were already used were also looted and it is rumor that they might find their way on the market&quot; another resident told the INQUIRER.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Monrovia closed to eighty percent of callers on talk show denounced the act of the west pointers noting that this act was carrying out people who still denying that there is no Ebola in Liberia. &quot;This denial thing is causing Liberia to lose more lives to Ebola&quot; a caller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to West Point yesterday it was also discovered that Ebola fear has grip the area after many got to realized that the looting of the Ebola Center could further spread the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My man this thing is not a joking things and I believe this township and beyond will experience a serious outbreak of the Ebola sickness since people used their bare hands to touch these Ebola mattresses, buckets and protective suits that were already used,&quot; a school teacher who intends to leave West Point said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ignorant, greediness and illiteracy are factors that contributed to people walking into the Ebola center to loot things that have been used already. I saw some of the looted mattresses that had blood stint on them God bless the people of West Point,&quot; a student said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tarnue Wolowala, a resident of Monrovia recommended that to stop the further spread of the Ebola virus, government should do more and if it requires that the entire West Point bbe quarantine such a decision must be take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development information reaching this paper says at least three persons have died from suspected Ebola in New Georgia Estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The INQUIRER has also been informed that another person is now on the run after sensing that his two brothers died mysteriously at their business center on the New Georgia Estate. It was recently disclosed to this paper that two brothers who were running the Free and Fair Business Center at the New Georgia West Junction died of suspected Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anonymous source also told this paper that the mother of the two brothers died later thus, instilling fear among the family. When the other brother learnt about the unfortunate situation according to our report, he escaped from the community for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is most disturbing according to residents of New Georgia is that the brother who escaped (name withheld) might take the virus to other communities where he will be interacting with residents of those areas thus, spreading the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are afraid whether these boys died from Ebola that is why we have chlorinate the entire shop and surroundings where they were selling, our greatest fear is that their other brother ran away, we do not know whether he is taking the virus with him,&quot; said Mamie Doe, a concerned resident of New Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of New Georgia are now living in fear as a result of the recent death of the three persons who were very active and moving actively in the community. &quot;They were very young and energetic, charging phones here but died mysteriously, later, their mother also died, so where are suspected that this could be Ebola,&quot; said another resident who preferred anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, residents of New Georgia have rejected the establishment of an Ebola testing center in the area. The residents most of whom are young people have threatened to stage a protest if their Representative, Saa Joseph forced the establishment of the center on the estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief interview via mobile phone yesterday, Rep. Joseph said he proposed the idea of establishing a testing center in the area but the residents vehemently refused to this and said they will protest any attempt to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Joseph said as representative of the people, he must listen to them and so, the will of the citizens must prevailed against his wish. Those many see the establishing of a testing center as a good idea, Joseph said his people are not willing to cooperate with such idea and therefore, he alone cannot force anything of such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the District#13 lawmaker has confirmed the death of three persons of suspected Ebola in the New Georgia Estate, but did not give detail of the circumstances leading to their death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The door to the Free and Fair Business center remain closed since the death of the two persons. Residents have chlorinated the entire area though they are living in fear after one of the brothers escaped the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commerce Ministry's move comes at a time when drivers of commercial vehicles are requesting sky-rocketing fares since the Liberia National Police and the Ministry of Justice had reduced the number traveling in a vehicle due to the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the new transportation fares at a news conference during the weekend, Commerce and Industry Minister, Axel Addy, said the Liberia National Police (LNP), the Federation of Road Transportation Union of Liberia (FRTUL) And the Ministry of Transport participated in the structuring of the new transport fares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Addy said at a time when the country is seriously combating the deadly Ebola virus which has both health and economic implications, the government intends to ensure that there is no price hiking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the new transport fares listing the previous price for gasoline was L$290.00 and now L$ 360.00 while transport fares has been increased by L$5.00 for short distance in the city and L$ 10.00 to L$ 20.00 increase for far distances (See new transport fares Inside).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said as the LNP is enforcing the decongestion of transport vehicles, it will also have to enforce the new transportation fares for the benefit of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said based on public outcry as it relates to the sharp increase in the price of major commodities including those to prevent the deadly Ebola virus , it has constituted inspection teams with the help of the LNP and the Liberia Marketing Association (LMA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry said the teams will vigorously inspect all businesses and monitor prices on the Liberian market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Commerce named areas of focus during the inspection as building materials sector, used clothing and readymade garments sector, frozen food, cold storage sector; food stuff and Provision sector; Stationery and House Material Sector; Electrical Electronic Sector, Motels, Hotels and Bars as well as Water industry sectors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transmission risk is low from flying is low, but mounting pressure forces Kenya Airways to suspend flights</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged governments not to impose blanket bans on trade and travel on Ebola-affected countries after Kenya joined a growing number of countries and airlines severing links to three west African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO has already said that the risk of Ebola transmission from air travel is low, but the level of fear is so high that several airlines have disregarded the UN agency's advice. The disease has already killed at least 1,145 people across west Africa this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The scale of the outbreak is much larger than anything ever seen before,&quot; said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman. &quot;It is an obvious source of concern and it is not to be underestimated, but we must take measures commensurate with the risk. What you don't want to do is to take blanket measures to cut off travel and trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such advice, Kenya is the latest country to jump on the bandwagon by declaring a travel ban on Saturday. From midnight on Tuesday, people travelling from or through Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia will not be allowed to enter the east African country, said Kenya's health ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, which allows entry to health professionals and Kenyans returning from those countries, was not included in the ban. The outbreak, which has killed more than 1,000 people, began in the forested zone on the borders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia earlier this year, and spread to Nigeria last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO last week said the outbreak had been vastly underestimated and will require &quot;extraordinary measures, on a massive scale&quot; if it is to be contained. M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), the medical charity, said the disease was spreading &quot;faster than we can respond to&quot;, and accused the WHO of being too slow to react.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Kenyan government's decision, Kenya Airways said it would suspend flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone, abruptly reversing its announcement on Friday that it would continue flying to those countries. The airline had been accused by medical experts and Kenyan politicians of putting profits ahead of prudence amid fears that its flights would spread the virus. The airline flies more than 70 flights a week to west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's chief executive, Titus Naikuni, had argued at a news conference on Friday that its flights actually helped to contain the Ebola outbreak by transporting medical staff, supplies and equipment to west Africa. But doctors representing the Kenya Medical Association had asked Kenya Airways to suspend flights to the four countries affected by Ebola &quot;until things stabilise&quot;. MPs also called on the carrier to halt its west African operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several airlines have already suspended flights to Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, including British Airways, Emirates Airlines, Arik Air and ASKY Airlines. Nigeria became the fourth Ebola-affected country after a Liberian-American man flew to Lagos on an ASKY flight and infected several people in the city before he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Cameroon, which borders Nigeria, announced on Friday it would suspend all flights from all four Ebola-affected countries. Korean Air announced on Thursday it would temporarily halt its service to Kenya despite the fact there are no cases of Ebola in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has withdrawn its athletes from the Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China as a result of the outbreak; the games opened on Saturday. The International Olympic Committee has barred athletes from Ebola-hit countries from competing in pool events and combat sports, affecting three athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartl said action commensurate with the risk of Ebola spreading through air travel has already been taken in the three affected countries: the screening of passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know it's happening. It makes sense at the departure end and there is nothing to stop screening at the incoming end. These are much better measures. You do not need a sledgehammer to crack a nut.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screening involves visual observations and asking passengers questions such as whether they have had known contact with Ebola cases and whether they feel ill or feverish. No one has been stopped from travelling since the screenings were introduced, said Hartl, who pointed out that the Liberian-American who died in quarantine in Lagos had left before screening was in place. But screening in his case might not have worked as he had left with no symptoms, but reported feeling unwell only on arrival in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola-affected countries are suffering economically as international airlines restrict flights, companies scale down regional operations and commercial trade is put on hold, said the World Bank. The bank, with the International Monetary Fund, reduced this year's economic growth estimate for Guinea to 3.5%, down from their original projection of 4.5% growth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WOMAN was last night in isolation in a Scottish hospital after showing symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patient, from Sierra Leone, was having urgent medical tests, as health officials were put on high alert amid fears the disease has spread to the UK for the first time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman was a detainee at the Dungavel immigration detention centre in South Lanarkshire, a holding unit mainly for failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation. It is understood she is being treated at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limited numbers of staff will be allowed contact with the patient, who is likely to be transferred to a highly-infectious disease ward somewhere in the UK. Home Office officials have since suspended the detention or release of detainees from the centre in a bid to contain any potential outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials across the UK have been alerted to the situation and a full emergency plan will be put into action if the patient tests positive, although the NHS trust treating the woman said it appeared highly unlikely that she would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from NHS Lanarkshire said: We are currently investigating a possible case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [Ebola].</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a precautionary measure and it would appear at this stage to be highly unlikely the patient will test positive for Ebola.' A Home Office spokesman said: We do not comment on operational matters.' It came as doctors said the Ebola outbreak in Africa will take at least six months to bring under control. Joanne Lui, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the pace of outbreaks in Guinea had slowed but other countries, particularly Liberia, now had to be the focus of efforts to contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: If we don't stabilise Liberia, we will never stabilise the region. In terms of timeline, we're not talking in terms of weeks, we're talking in terms of months?...?at least I would say six months, and I'm being?...?very optimistic.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her warning came after the World Health Organization said the toll of 1,069 deaths and a further 900 sufferers could vastly underestimate the magnitude' of the outbreak.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making remark at the donation ceremony held at LIBA Office in Paynesville, GRANDCOALIO Chairman Dee-Maxwell S.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Kemayah added that their organization has unanimously vowed to intensify their support in buttressing the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that following weeks of observations coupled with consultations with authorities of the Press Union of Liberia (PUL), it was realized that support to media was timely; he also said that they hope the message in rural areas will not stop, and hoped that their people will be educated about the danger of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Kemayah stated that the fight against Ebola is not a fight to be limited to the government because the government cannot do it all alone; it requires a collective work to make the country Ebola free. He said the donation of the fuel to the PUL should be distributed to electronic media houses across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;We are of the strongest conviction that information is power and with the level of work being done by media houses across the country is worth more than commendation&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part Press Union of Liberia (PUL) president Abdullah Kamara said the media will continue the education and sensitization of the Ebola awareness to assist in the eradication of the deadly Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion was held at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications where Minister Fredrick Norkeh, LTA Commissioners and Libtelco top brass gathered to consolidate their purpose.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Norkeh added that the management and staff of the sector (MoPT, LIBTELCO and LTA) along with the Board of Directors listened carefully and passionately to the needs of the people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst positive news of the survival of persons affected by the Ebola virus, latest report says victims at the ELWA Ebola Isolation Center are leaving the camp due to lack of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disclosing this at the National Ebola Task Force Meeting held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Monrovia yesterday, Health Minister, Walter Gwenigale, said he had received several calls from the center that the people are hungry and need food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Gwenigale, based on this latest report, most of the victims are now leaving the center which is a major threat to several communities in which those leaving are going. &quot;I'm getting calls every day of the lack of food; the people say they are hungry and I understand that there is food there but I'm getting these calls every minute,&quot; Liberia's Health Minister Gwenigale said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In quick clarification, Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah, said food is available at the various Isolation Camps but those who are making the calls may need special diet. Nyenswah said the victims are being provided meal three times daily adding that the callers are the higher-ups who may need special kind of diet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah promised that an investigation will be launched into the complaint by the Ebola victims and solution be found in addressing the issue. He also disclosed that the Ministry of Health has received seven tons of food from the World Health Organization (WHO) for those quarantined at the various isolation centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Presidential Task Force on Ebola is considering quarantining the densely populated community of West Point in Monrovia and Dolo Town in Margibi County. West Point is a slum populated community with an estimated population of over 20,000 inhabitants, while in Dolo Town report says at least 25 persons have died due to strange circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the meeting yesterday, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf proposed to the Task Force the isolation of West Point and Dolo Town. The two highly populated communities have reported high rate of Ebola deaths in recent times. The task force is also considering the closing of the Waterside General Market to stop affected persons from leaving the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the rapid spread of Ebola in the country, the Ministry of Health opened one holding center in a household in West Point on Wednesday. The Ministry is planning to open2-3 more in the next few days based upon protocols designed by MSF and the Case management team, to isolate and hold patients before moving them to the JFK or ELWA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf reasoned that to isolate West Point and densely populated areas is a difficult task but the Task Force must consider and study the situation before making final decision on the issue. At the same time, the Task Force also wants the Duala Market to be cleared so as to avoid those in the Duala area from contracting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Defense Minister, Brownie Samukai has called on Government to begin taking some drastic measures to stop further spread of the Ebola virus that is killing hundreds of Liberians on a daily basis. Samukai said sternly that West Point must be quarantined with the closure of the market and that another densely populated area of Duala be cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defense Minister said if these steps are not taken, the virus will continue to spread and claim more lives in the coming days and months. He added, &quot;If you can't contain those areas, you can't resolve the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the Task Force are calling for the imposition of curfew to stop the movement of individuals in various communities. They also want Ebola message being played on radios to be changed as the right messages are not being sent out to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) Liberia Chapter has joined its voice with the Nursing and Dental Association of Liberia in appealing to the Government of Liberia to consider reinstating dismissed health workers in the spirit of national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WANEP also noted that while Liberians acknowledge that the country is in a state of emergency, it is urging the Government of Liberia (GOL) to continue to maintain law and order, and respect the fundamental rights of its citizens and other residents in the Republic of Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WANEP also recommended that government ensure that continuous robust and tactful implementation of the Action Plan in containing and preventing the deadly Ebola virus disease is maintained until the complete eradication of the deadly Ebola virus through the length and breadth of Liberia and its neighboring countries to avoid its return to future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering a special press statement on the current situation surrounding the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus and interventions against its spread, Mrs. Victoria Wollie, National Network Coordinator of WANEP-Liberia said, &quot;In regards to the dissemination of information to the public, we acknowledge efforts being made by the Ministry of Information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she said WANEP also observed that there are all sorts of information in the likes of rumors that quickly spread into communities with some of these having the propensity to create panic and chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, we call on the Ministry to speak on such issues in a timely manner to deal with misinformation. This is important in these difficult times of our nation's history,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Wollie said WANEP-Liberia will continue to engage all local and international partners in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus by educating the population on preventive measures required to rid the country of the havoc that the Ebola virus continues to cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will continue to liaise with network members to use their skill in Peacebuilding to encourage mediation and dialogues in situations that may arise in their communities,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Wollie, expanding further on the Deadly Ebola virus said, &quot;There are no lesser words to describe the crisis we the people of Liberia endure each day. Since the outbreak, we have recognized the resolve of the Liberian people to fight this deadly disease using every means possible; spreading news of the existence of the deadly virus in our midst and its destructive and perilous nature, educating the public about the preventive measures required to protect oneself as prescribed by authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and instituting preventive actions such as ensuring hand washing facilities are available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Liberians' efforts have been buttressed by the international community who has sent doctors, healthcare workers, protective gears and medicine and financial resources to deal with the situation which is a national and regional health disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WANEP Coordinator said the people and government of the Republic of Liberia should acknowledge the generous contributions and technical support being galvanized in containing and eradicating the deadly Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that vein she commended the United States of America, the People's Republic of China, the Canadian Government, National and International Humanitarian Organizations, the Media (both electronic and print) through the leadership of the Press Union of Liberia: Special Task Force, Religious bodies and all Civil Society Organizations for their support to the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, The Women in Peace Building Network in Liberia (WIPNET-Liberia) yesterday ended a fourteen-day intensive fast and prayer in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exercise was part of effort to combat the deadly Ebola virus which has taken the lives of over &quot;two hundred&quot; people across Liberia and leaving several others affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourteen days of intensive fast and prayer which brought together a little over one hundred and fifty women from across the country was intended to seek God's intervention in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the National Network Coordinator for the West Africa Network for Peace-building (WIPNET-Liberia) Madam Victoria Wollie, the fourteen days fast and prayer aimed at presenting their supplications to God Almighty and also asking for mercy in order to save the country from the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that the fight against the Ebola virus cannot be successful without the intervention of the Lord who she described as the only solution to the problem that Liberia is currently faced with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Wollie noted that the fourteen days was a time of denial of their humanly feelings, and the things of the world in order to seek the face of the Lord on behalf of the people of Liberia noting that it was not an easy time but that it was worthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Network Coordinator for the West Africa Network for Peace-building disclosed that the fast and prayer will continue but not in the open as it was for the past fourteen days but rather be done at their various homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Victoria Wollie however called on every Liberian to join the fight against the Ebola virus and put away their political differences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has warned businesses operating in the country against price hike stressing that to do so is a criminal act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader made the statement on Wednesday when she met with members of the Business community operating in the country to advise them that as the country fights the Ebola virus nothing must be done to increase the hardship of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the disclosure yesterday at the regular Ministry of Information Press briefing in Monrovia, Information Minister, Lewis G. Brown, said the President stressed that the hiking of prices for goods and services in the country is unacceptable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown said be it goods, services rendered or transportation fare, nobody is to hike prices as the current situation in the country already has an economic implication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown said during the meeting with the Business Community which included the Liberia Business Association (LIBA) the President made it known that the hiking of prices at this time is a crime against the Liberian people and anyone caught will be arrested and prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown said at the meeting, the business community assured the President that there will be no price hiking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as the situation is today, the prices of goods and services are sky-rocketing, some being increased at rate of hundred percent while at times transportation fares are increased by over one hundred and fifty percent at the detriment of the ordinary citizens who have been asked to stay home during the Ebola epidemic which has claimed over a thousand lives in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At yesterday's Press briefing Minister Brown also sounded a warning to owners and operators of video clubs and entertainment centers not to take into their business places a huge crowd of people due to the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown said each of these institutions or centers must have a bucket where customers can wash their hands before entering and before leaving. He disclosed that government will deploy people to ensure compliance at every video club and entertainment center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Minister also said operators of video clubs and entertainment centers must ensure that there is ventilation and if these regulations are not adhered to the Government of Liberia will be forced to close down such video clubs and entertainment centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown said this warning is being given at a time that the European soccer leagues are slated to begin next week. &quot;What we are saying is do not put twenty people on one bench in your video club because when you do not abide by this measure we will close you down and when you come to see me I will not see you&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the head of the Ebola Response Task Force, Mr. Tolbert Nyeswah has disclosed that to further the fight against the deadly Ebola virus, government will put into place a community driven approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said communities will be monitored and if the case of Ebola increases in a particular community people there will be quarantined and victims placed in a school house for treatment before being moved to a larger treatment center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that two doctors are in the country from Uganda to train health workers and are assigned at the JFK Hospital Ebola Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nyeswah said new laboratory equipment has arrived in the country to enhance the fight against Ebola and noted that technical teams are being put in place to be spread to affected counties with the support of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) based in Atlanta, Georgia; the Medicine San-Frontier (MSF), and the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ferocity and scale of devastation the Ebola virus is directly and indirectly taking away lives of Liberians and others have appealed to sense of urgency and solidarity of every citizen wanting to do something quickly to end the nightmare. Even citizens in the Diaspora are sharing the same feeling, political organizations not excluded. When the list of those who turn that sense of urgency and solidarity into concrete reality is drawn, even long after the crisis, it would include one of Liberia's major political parties, the Liberty Party. Recently the party released a comprehensive awareness and sensitization information. This time, the LP is getting ready to contribute lifesaving equipment to health workers in the frontline. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Liberty Party has intensified its campaign against the spread of the deadly Ebola virus when its diaspora members secure a huge consignment of assorted materials and equipment destined to Liberia soon for the empowerment of health workers fighting against the epidemic in the country.Disclosing this at a news conference at the Liberty Party's headquarters on the Old Road Wednesday, Liberty Party's National Chairman, Cllr. Jonathan Fonati Kofa, said the party's members in the United States of America USA have raised about US$10,000 for the fight against the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia.Cllr. Kofa said the members of party in the US, led by party stalwart Mr. Phillip Suah mobilized for the funds to purchase of the health equipment valued at US$5,000 while US$5,000 in cash through the Texas Center for Disease Control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Party's National Chairman also indicated that the material and equipment are in the final preparatory stage for shipment into Liberia.When the equipment arrive, he said, they will be distributed among the necessary health institutions through the relevant authorities or stakeholders responsible to fight the virus out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Kofa named the equipment and materials purchased by the party's diaspora members as preventive gears, gloves and other safety measure materials, saying that the Liberty Party will ensure that health workers benefit from the materials while the money will be awarded to NGOs, , US$2500.00 each to the Samaritan Purse and the Liberia National Red Cross Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned about the danger Ebola posed to the nation, the Liberty Party said it has already set up an anti-Ebola taskforce in the US that is headed by two of the its senatorial candidates, Mrs. Edith Gongloe-Weh of Nimba County and Mr. Benjamin Samvee of Montserrado County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the party's concerned about the spread of EBOLA virus in the country has prompted partisans in the diaspora to contribute to the fight against the virus.The Evola viral disease has claimed the lives of some 932 persons and has infected a 1000 more in the subregion, Liberia being one of the prevalent spot. In Liberia, two of the main NGOs engaged in the fight include the Samaritan Purse and the Liberia National Red Cross, two of who the Liberty intends to give 250,000 USD each.The cash donation, Cllr. Kofa indicated, will be a means of assisting the two NGOs in their respective efforts to fighting against the Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberty Party Chairman, expressing disappointment in the careless attitude toward the fight against Ebola, said the party is seriously worried about the danger the disease poses to Liberians. He cited the crowding some Liberians into bear shops and nightclubs when the issue of Ebola demands sober reflections and care that could serve as preventive measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded by calling on Liberians to support every effort intended to fight against the virus in the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New measures will block unregistered SIM cards and give bonuses for new registration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cellcom Telecommunications Inc, has announced new intensified measures to ensure that all of its more than 1 million subscribers are registered.The company says it has put in place the new measures in line with regulations from the Liberian Telecommunications Authority (LTA) and the Government of Liberia (GOL) in a bid to help reduce crime and prevent hoax calls, which are usually associated with numbers which cannot be traced to an owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New security measures put in place as part of the ongoing national state of emergency recently declared by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to fight the Ebola virus in Liberia is one of the key reason for the company's push to ensure the registration of all SIM cards. By ensuring the registration or blocking of all SIM cards will help prevent the use of unregistered SIM cards to make prank calls or carry out activities that could compromise national security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's spokesperson has also pointed to LTA's recent discovery of a large consignment of illegal SIM boxes using unregistered mobile numbers to divert much needed revenue from the GOL as another reason to ensure the registration of all SIM cards. Corporate Communications Strategist Dr. Kimmie Weeks highlighted that use of illegal SIM boxes to reroute incoming international calls robs government of hundreds of thousands of United States dollars in revenue. Weeks observed: &quot;in these difficult times, when the government needs all of the resources it can get to fight this deadly disease, we cannot allow that revenue to be stolen by shady individuals and companies who are taking advantage of using unregistered SIM cards.&quot; He underscored that going forward, none of Cellcom's sales agents, stores, or point of sale centers would sell SIM cards or mobile devices without first registering the number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Cellcom's CEO Mr. John Vasikaran announced that the company would block all unregistered numbers on its system by August 7, 2014. &quot;We are painfully aware that many legitimate customers will be affected by the block, but we believe in abiding by the laws of Liberia and must support government's efforts to protect the people of Liberia.&quot; He noted that Cellcom had made the registration process free, easy and efficient to ensure what he called &quot;maximum results.&quot; Vasikaran encouraged customers to take advantage of the free registration process in order to secure the number and ensure the continuation of services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vasikaran said that as part of if its efforts to ensure the registration of all of its customers, Cellcom had invested in new equipment for all of itssales centers, point of sales centers, as well as sales counters at Total Service Stations across the country. He went on to disclose that Cellcom had hired a large team of part time young people to carryout registration in local communities in Monrovia and adjacent areas. The move comes in a bid to enhance the registration process, while also providing temporary job solution to young people who are not in school because of the several weeks of mandatory shut down of the education system. &quot;We are doing everything we can to ensure that this process is accessible to all,&quot; Said Vasikaran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the registration process, Cellcom subscribers have been enabled to verify the status of their registration by sending a text message with the words &quot;REG&quot; to the number 5434 to receive confirmation of registration or to initiate the registration process from their mobile device. All new SIMs registered in August 2014 would receive 50MB of data and 50 minutes of voice calls for 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vasikaran admonished subscribers to take advantage of the grace period and bonuses to register their SIM cards to prevent their numbers from being permanently blocked.Dr. Weeks encouraged Cellcom's subscribers to ensure the registration of their SIM cards to continue to benefit from access to Cellcom's services during the state of emergency. This includes the ability to call the ebola emergency response hotline on the toll free number 4455 to get information about ebola or report suspected cases, benefit of the three days of free calls, as well as the Cellcom's new program which allows customers to dial the United States, France, Canada, China, Portugal, Germany, Italy and India at 50 Cents.</SPAN></P>

Guinean Ambassador to Liberia, His Excellency S.E. ElhadjAbdoulaye Dore, told The Analyst that the various border points entering into Liberia from Guinea have remained open since the outbreak of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only problem being faced at the borders right now is with the authorities on the other side who are not allowing easy entry into their country. For us, we have no problem with people leaving and entering as long as they can adhere to measures put in place. We have all the detergent and anti-bacteria materials needed,&quot; he explained.The Guinean envoy indicated that that measureshave been put in place in Guinea to make sure that the virus is not spread to neighboring countries.Ambassador Dore said that though the spread of the virus in West Africa was said to have started in Guinea, the Guinean authorities have never considered closing its border with neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that with the alarming death rate caused by the virus in the sub-region, the Guinean authorities have also put in to place measures that will ensure that people entering and leaving the country are tested for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Dore maintained that Guinea has never shut down its borders as reported on the BBC regular morning &quot;News Day&quot; program, saying he was shocked to learn that their borders have been shut down, claiming that the borders are functioning well and businesses are going on as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asserted that the Guinean authority is doing everything possible to maintain good diplomatic relations with its neighbors and that nothing will prompt them to take such action.Ambassador Dore said various testing centers have already been established so as to conduct test on suspected Ebola patients in and around the country.He named the Guigadou testing center as the main center between Guinea and Liberia which is being used by both governments to carry on testing for Liberians and Guineans as a means of detecting suspected Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has warned business houses in the country against unnecessary profiteering. The Ministry has further warned against arbitrary increase of the prices of essential goods and services. The Deputy Commerce Minister and Industry for Administration, Mr. Cyril Allen II warned, &quot;These are drastic time and we must take drastic actions&quot; cautioning all businesses engaged with the unwholesome practices to desist from such habits. The Deputy Commerce Minister spoke at the Ministry of Information's regular press briefing Thursday when he particularized commodities essential to enhance the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry's warning came in the wake of the sharp increase the prices of basic goods and services following regulations introduced by government to support the State of Emergency recently announced by the government to contain the spread of the deadly Ebola Viral Disease. In the face of the anti-Ebola campaign, prices of other basic commodities including wash-hand materials such as hand sanitizers, sanitary liquid, plastic buckets, detergent soap, Dettol, insecticide and soap prices have gone up thereby creating more hardship for the impoverish average Liberians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also named rubber gloves, chlorine and masks, saying that escalating the prices of basic goods and services, especially those that are essential in the anti-ebola campaign is sad and does not auger well in the campaign towards eradicating the Ebola disaster that has engulf Liberia Besides, business houses have increased the prices of consumable commodities while fare of commercial vehicles have been sky rocketed by more than 50 percent, a situation which has made the standard of living unbearable for the people.On the first day emergency, the cost of transportation to various destinations diametrically increased and has been climbing since, while a 25kg bag of rice in Monrovia which was sold at L$1200 is now L$1500 or more while reports from the countryside puts the cost at about L$2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the business people have always said there was already no price control mechanism, needless should that be conceived during the situation of the state of emergency.This outright exploitation of the masses, using prevailing situation as an alibi, has grasped the attention of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Accordingly, Mr. Allen noted that his ministry has deployed 120 inspectors who have been mandated to go to the field, look at the prices of these goods; and directed to seize any of goods that are seen on the market that prices hiked or any of them that have been hoarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Allen averred that the ministry's inspectors are out there on the field with a specific mandate to monitor the prices and sales of these materials and to seize goods that are sold at hiked prices on the market. He said reiterated that the ministry will publish recommended prices for essential goods on the Liberian market; &quot;we are going to publish what the actual prices on goods are going to be in keeping with their invoices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These measures, he noted, are the start of rigorous check on these businesses and even the small scale dealers; saying that the ministry in this public manner is advising all businesses in the country, who are engaged in this unscrupulous business activities to revert back to normal business practices and sell at normal prices.But the Ministry said it was instituting the inspection as a measure to reprimand those who are trying to taint the government in the face of the prevailing ebola crisis that has plagued the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister Allen further said his ministry has already cautioned business houses in the country against such a bad practice of exploitation at the time the government has started to fight against the deadly Ebola viral disease from Liberia According to Deputy Minister Allen, the exploitation of the Liberian people by the business people in the wake of the anti-ebola campaign must stop. He said the ministry's his attention has been drawn to some unscrupulous business houses in the country that are bent on hiking the prices of essential materials useable to enhance the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that because the Ministry wants to address this problem step by step and meticulously, the warning in the media followed a two day ago engagement of the business community at which time the issue was discussed. However, the deputy minister of commerce said the business community has assured the ministry that they were going back to revert to reducing the prices to lower cost of these materials that would be affordable for all to buy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics, law and danger to life have combined to present themselves to the conscience of Liberia's contemporary leaders. The outbreak of Ebola, the virus with East African origin, has turned the country into a big graveyard not in any Hollywood scene but in a live and practical way. Some may be shaking themselves off from what they think is a dream; but it is a reality struck on the membrane of the country. But before Ebola there was politics as well as the interests and intrigue that come with it. So, even though the state of the nation is a far cry from normalcy, and it is widely accepted to present a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; for which lawmakers concurred with President Sirleaf in her declaration of state emergency, politics and law are still having some bearing on the national conscience and the leaders of today are embroiled in a heated debate. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The postponement of the ensuing legislative elections from October to December of this year by the National Elections Commission without legislative mandate has generated mixed feelings amongst senators when a letter by President Sirleaf informing the senate of the change in election was put on the floor for discussion.The decision by NEC to postpone the election was communicated to the Senate by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for legislative approbation and this was introduced on plenary floor on Tuesday, August 12. Arriving at a conclusion on Tuesday was been heavily characterized by nosy bickering leading to a dichotomous opinion between to arguments toward resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two schools of thought emerged, one calling for Supreme Court intervention and the other seeking consultation amongst the branches of government.Some senators, who pundits say formed their arguments from a desire to prolonging their stay in power, expressed support and no objection to the postponement decision while others objected strongly and want the NEC tested by a Supreme Court review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola outbreak triggered the declaration of a state of emergency by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and recently the National Election Commission announced recommending the postponement of the ensuing senatorial elections in consideration of unfolding unsteady developments in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the State of Emergency, public gatherings are prohibited to avert congestion which could cause the spread of Ebola by body contacts, and the postponement is apparently from the consideration that electioneering is crowd polling and could contribute to the spread of the deadly disease, according to analysts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the tension-packed Senate plenary presided over by Senate Pro Tempore Gbehzohngar Findley, senators who are provisionally listed for participation in the special senatorial elections spoke strongly embracing the postponement decision while others, with diverse opinions in the debate, saw the option of going to supreme court as being the best.Grand Cape Mount County Senator Able Massally informed his colleagues that there have been more debates in many quarters by some individuals questioning the legitimacy of the 15 senators that should be seeking re-elections in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massalley is one of the 15 senators whose tenure would elapse by October in keeping with mandate of the Constitution and should be contesting for another term of office.The longtime-serving Grand Cape Mount County senator said he came across a group discussing legitimacy of the current senators seeking re-elections in the wake of postponement of the pending legislative election by the National Elections Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Cape Mount County Senator note that he has informed the group, which he said was discussing at a community teashop to take their enquiries to the Supreme Court of Liberia for a constitutional opinion on the decision of NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Senator, the holding of elections in Liberia is timed constitutionally, and therefore it was important for individuals or groups questioning the legitimacy of the 15 senators standing for re-elections to take advantage of the Supreme Court for redress as provided for by the very Constitution.He also stressed that the government is under obligation to address any situation that poses threats to the nation and its people as in the case of the Ebola situation for which the election is being postponed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The postponement decision by NEC, a legislative staff who remarked from balcony of the Senate Chamber said, could be an opportunity for the extension Senator Massalley and his likes' senatorial mandate which is expected to end this October if the election was to be held on schedule.Another Senator who is facing a tough challenge in his home country, Sinoe County Sen. Mabutu Vlah Nyepan noted that there was a need for serious consultation among the three branches of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sinoe County Senator indicated that the consultation is intended to arrive at a decision that would be acceptable for the postponement of the election based on constitutional reliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Senator Nyenpan, the possibility of holding series of consultations among the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature would explore and acceptably legitimized decision for the change in schedule of the senatorial elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another possible outgoing senator Isaac W. Nyenabo of Grand Gedeh County pointed out that he sharedthe intervention of those calling for consultation amongst the three branches of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyenabo who is not seeking reelection said, &quot;We should not play down the need for holding consultations as it was important to legitimize the decision of the NEC to have the election postponed to another schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst tense debate along the two key points of seeking Supreme Court intervention or holding consultation amongst the branches of argument, River-Gee Senator Matthew Jaye made a motion that the matter be sent to committee for a unified senate position, and the motion was carried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the National Task Force on Ebola, anytime from now, announces the last infected person healed or dead, with no additional cases emerging afterwards, Liberia would sigh a huge relief from the virus' nightmarish devastation. Though Ebola-related deaths would have come to an end, it would not be the end of the trouble for Liberia. Pundits are predicting that the devastated population would then be awakening to an equally ruinous crisis--a biting economic crisis, which if not managed would result into political crisis. And the roots of those crises have begun to form right now. The postwar country's largest investor, Arcelormittal, is parking out of here and there are signs that other major concessionaries would soon be freezing their jobs-underpinning operations, as The Analyst's Edward Palmer reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the evolving situation of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, contractors working on the phase 2 expansion project of ArcelorMittal have declared force majeure and are moving out of the country, according to a communication given to this paper on Monday by the company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ArcelorMittal's Chief Executive Officer for Mining, Bill Scotting, said while the termination of contracts for several companies sub- contracting for Arcelor Mittal is taking effect, the priority for Liberia and any other affected countries right now is to contain and ultimately stop the current outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are providing full support to the government in this regard and taking every precaution to protect all of our employees on the ground in Liberia&quot;, he added.Mr. Scotting assured that ArcelorMittal has made a long-term commitment to Liberia and that the company will maintain this commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging that the recent developments are very alarming, Mr. Scotting noted that at present, the company's management believes that the emergency procedures and other measures developed and currently in place at all ArcelorMittal sites in Liberia make it possible to continue phase one of their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia, ArcelorMittal has taken every precaution to protect its employees and operations, including providing thermo flash scanners to test for fever in all employees and visitors to all ArcelorMittal Liberia locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Scotting added that 500 full sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) have already been distributed to ArcelorMittal hospitals and other hospitals and clinics in Nimba, Buchanna, and training has been provided to health care workers and employees. Ebola awareness sessions were conducted by a leading Ebola prevention and control expert, and an infectious disease nurse has been brought in who serves as the company's in house expert that is now working closely with ArcelorMittal hospital team, Mr. Scotting confided through his communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ArcelorMittal is currently mining and shipping 5 million tons of ore a year in Liberia from its operations in Yekepa and Buchanna described as Phase one of its operations.The company is also working on an expansion project described as phase-2 that will see shipments rise to 15 million tons of ore with first production planned by the end of 2015.There are reports that several other major companies operating in the country are on red alert and anxiously monitoring the situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KENYA is at high risk of an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, the World Health Organisation has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the East African country - popular with Britons going on safari - is vulnerable because it is a major transport hub with many flights from West Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola has been confined to four countries in the west of the continent - Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has confirmed a third person who was in contact with an American finance consultant who flew into the country with the disease has died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Tom Frieden, director of the US's health protection agency, said he is deeply concerned' that the disease might start spreading in the country's capital Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest figures show that almost 2,000 people have now caught Ebola and there have been 1,069 deaths, including 56 in just two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada is donating up to 1,000 doses of an experimental vaccine to help stem the spread of the disease and Germany has ordered all its citizens, except key medics and diplomats, to leave Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has admitted the outbreak is out of control and sanctioned the use of untested drugs to combat it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Researchers from American institutions found that Ebola carries a protein called VP24, which interferes with a molecule called interferon that is vital to the immune response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Figuring out how VP24 promotes this disruption will suggest new ways to defeat the virus,&quot; said Dr Chris Basler, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation yesterday reported 128 new Ebola cases and 56 deaths in West Africa in the two days to Aug 11, raising the death toll from the worst ever outbreak of the disease to 1,069.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Sierra Leone confirmed the death of a second doctor at the hands of the virus. Dr Modupeh Cole, a senior physician at the Connaught Hospital in Freetown, was diagnosed with Ebola last Friday. His death came two weeks after Sierra Leone's sole virologist, Dr Umar Khan, died from the virus after successfully treating more than 100 patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone's president, appealed to the international community for help in raising an extra &pound;10.8 million to fund a &quot;national response plan&quot; to fight the epidemic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was acting strangely even before he boarded the plane, hunching over in pain and avoiding physical contact with other passengers milling around the airport in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Once airborne, he was sick several times. By the time he disembarked at Lagos airport - one of the busiest in the continent - he was no longer able to stand unaided, diplomats and a witness told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who rushed forward to help did not know Patrick Sawyer was in the final stages of an Ebola-induced breakdown, when the deadly disease is at its most contagious. More than 24 hours passed before the Liberian-American civil servant was diagnosed, allowing the virus to gain a toehold in Africa's most populous city and, for the first time, turning the threat of an urban outbreak into a nightmarish possibility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching three regional neighbours - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - battle an eight-month epidemic, Nigerian officials are scrambling to contain a potential fourth frontline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the World Health Organisation said the number of confirmed, probable and suspected Ebola cases had grown to 1,975 with 1,069 deaths. The German government called on its citizens to leave Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone because of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A colleague travelling alongside Sawyer and a nurse who treated him have both succumbed to Ebola. At least eight others have caught the disease in Lagos, and some 200 are under surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some unique challenges that have come up,&quot; said John Vertefeuille, leading the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) response team in the city. &quot;The population density is a challenge and it's one we're looking at closely in terms of how you do contact tracing. What Lagos has as strengths is there's a really talented workforce to draw on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil giant Nigeria has more resources than most to handle an outbreak but whether the situation spins out of control hinges on the Herculean task of tracing contacts in a crowded, freewheeling city of transients. It took 10 days to trace Sawyer's driver to Port Harcourt, a densely-populated city 600km south of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident has highlighted a deeper culture of neglect when it comes to infectious tropical diseases that ravage West Africa each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, much has come down to chance. As a diplomat, Sawyer, 40, was whisked from the airport by a private driver. The company car - in which he was again sick, according to a Nigerian health official - was taken to a diplomatic compound, and was not used again because it was a national holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But public health workers were on strike, so Sawyer was taken to a small family clinic. There, the team who tried to save his life did not initially suspect Ebola, or work with protective gear. At least one other patient at the clinic would later catch Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family hospital Sawyer went to was caught unawares. If it had been a public hospital, we would have had a better chance of containing it,&quot; said John Oladejo, of Nigeria's Public Health Department, which in April sent dozens of doctors on an Ebola training course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has one doctor per 2,879 people, compared with one per 10,000 in Guinea or one per 86,275 in Liberia. &quot;We have a window of opportunity at the moment to contain it but there's no room for letting down your guard,&quot; said Chikwe Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist who helped stem an Ebola outbreak in Sudan a decade ago. &quot;It's not that we don't have the resources. The challenge is that there are things you have to do religiously every time you're dealing with a patient, and we're just not used to that level of diligence in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the noisy downtown street where Sawyer was hospitalised before being moved to a specially-built isolation ward, hardware salesman Emmanuel Uju sat on a ladder balanced over an open sewer which runs past his house. &quot;I don't shake anyone's hand any more, but I truly have faith it won't spread more. They said you just need to separate the affected people to stop it spreading,&quot; he said. Border controls - which have helped in seven previous Ebola outbreaks - are unlikely to do so in Lagos, whose population ebbs and flows with up to 4,000 new migrants each day. &quot;Ten years ago in Sudan there were no mobile phones, no Twitter. We drove around in Land Rovers with microphones telling people what to do. Today we need to think about how to communicate with the public so that they know what to do without creating panic,&quot; said Ihekweazu, who runs the health information site nigeriahealthwatch.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another site set up within 24 hours of the first confirmed case, EbolaFacts.com, received 600,000 hits and 850,000 Facebook views within a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But technology is a double-edged sword. Yahya Balogun woke up to a 4am call last Friday. On the line, his mother demanded he stock up on salt - she had received a text circulating with the &quot;cure&quot; of a hot salt bath before dawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two hours later she called again and asked, 'Yahya, have you done what I asked? Have you sent all your friends the message? This is a terrible disease and you need to pass on the advice',&quot; the taxi driver recounted. The rumour prompted two deaths from overdosing on salt water. This week an epileptic man reportedly died after residents in Edo state thought his convulsions were a symptom of Ebola and refused to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see the fear in people's faces when we're going around tracing contacts in the community. You have to explain to each person that there's nothing to be scared of - the likelihood of survival is much higher if you come forward in time,&quot; said Oladejo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they ask, what about the Liberian, we tell them: that's exactly what he didn't do; he didn't come forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Goodluck Jonathan has declared a national emergency, and approved a 1.9bn naira special fund. Despite outbreaks of cholera and Lassa fever - a similarly deadly haemorrhagic fever - that kill tens of thousands annually, the country has no adequate isolation units, so officials rushed through orders for special tents and protective suits essential to prevent contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola's rarity means it is often overlooked globally too. Fewer than 300 Ebola specialists are stretched thin on the ground in three other nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just hope all our work is not in vain,&quot; Oladejo said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEVERAL PERSONS AND institutions have begun identifying with government's efforts to curtail the spread of the deadly Ebola virus by making donations in cash, cheques and kind to the National Task Force headed by the Chief Executive, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECENTLY, THE AFRICA Motors contributed US$5,000 and Mr. Seymour Grann, popularly known as SG also gave his contribution of US$1,000 as well as the Eliza Turner Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON MONDAY, THE Government of the People's Republic of China gave its donation in items worth about US$1.7 m while a company in the United States has consented to sending an experimental drug to be tested on those affected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMONG OTHERS WHO have join the fight against Ebola in Liberia has been the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Government of the United States of America and even the Liberian Government through its National Legislature who set aside some U$ 20 m in its national budget to be used for that purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OTHER PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS have made their own meager contributions to electronic media institutions in Monrovia including the latest made to 45 radio stations across the country with the intent of assisting the media continue the Ebola awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS A good start in the fight against the Ebola virus that is taking a rapid toll in the country. To date over 300 persons have lost their lives and thousands are suspected or have contracted the virus including medical doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS NO secret that everyday several dead bodies are being removed from communities while many are still complaining about the lack of swiftness in getting the National Task Force to respond as expected; a situation that sometimes leads to residents resulting to setting road blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEING COGNIZANT THAT many persons have begun identifying with the fight of Ebola in the country, it is equally important that the National Task Force use wisely and appropriately the funds and items provided especially by our international partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS SAID that to whom much is given much is expected, therefore, we expect that those responsible for receiving and expending funds being donated will ensure proper accountability, as this is necessary to attract additional assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, WE WANT to thank all those who have contributed and hope that others will emulate this good example to end this nightmare that has befallen this nation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities of Bong County say they have completed clearing the site for the construction of a centrally-located Ebola Treatment Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site is a mile away from the Gbarnga-Monrovia Highway and is in the vicinity of the Leper Colony in Suakoko District, Bong County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the disclosure on Monday at the regular briefing of the Ebola Response Task Force at the Phebe Hospital Compound in Suakoko District, Bong County Development Superintendent, Anthony Sheriff, said, &quot;Despite the lack of money in the coffers of the county we have done everything possible to clear the site with the help of some partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff however frowned at a story carried on Monday in the media which claimed that the Superintendent of Bong County was doing nothing in response to the Ebola outbreak in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said county authorities will remain focused and committed to the work of the local Ebola Task Force and the County Health Team (CHT) to ensure that the disease is eliminated from the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, CHT has lauded the Health Ministry and Cuttington University (CU) for supplying it with 50 pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), chlorine, assorted supplies, 125 burial bags and rice, while CU contributed 50 gallons of fuel each to Phebe Hospital and for the site clearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the CHT has reported that four of the five specimens sent to Monrovia last week have proven positive, while one of them was negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also recorded five new suspected cases in newly-quarantine Balakitela Town in Salala District where the Town Chief is reported to have escaped to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently there were four household deaths in Balaketela Town, following which county health officials contacted the police to quarantine the town for fear of the virus been spread to nearby towns and villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CHT also informed the gathering that of the three community deaths over the weekend, two were in Gbarnga and the other in Sinyea community, behind Cuttington University.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group said, all Liberians must join the task force headed by President Eller Johnson Sirleaf to fight and eradicate this deadly Ebola virus that is killing Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a release, the High Table Intellectuals noted that Liberians should go beyond considering the Ebola issue as a myth and begin to believe that it is real.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), Tim Callaghan, said his team has identified key needs stemming from the Ebola outbreak and is working with the Government of Liberia and partners to address them as soon as possible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with reporters yesterday at a press conference held at the United States Embassy in Monrovia, Mr. Callaghan said they are supporting the government with plans and materials and they will continue to assess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has contributed US$14.5 million to help contain the deadly Ebola virus and that the United States Government is doing all it can to support the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Mr. Callaghan is appealing to the Government of Liberia and other partners to coordinate with DART and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to enable them work together smoothly to contain the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that the fight against the Ebola virus is a global fight and that Liberia can not do it alone. He said for the Ebola response, DART will be coordinating critical areas of the response such as planning, operations, and logistics; drawing forth critical assets and resources from across the U.S. Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Satish Pillai who is a medical officer at the CDC said that this is the largest outbreak that has ever been recorded and that additional staffs will be deployed in Liberia during the coming days noting that the CDC has conducted trainings on case identification and how to use materials that have been donated by other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said no one knows how long the outbreak will continue, but suggested that contact tracing and case identification will get the situation under control. He mentioned that they have identified the gaps and are working along with the Ministry of Health and health workers in the various counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DART leader and the CDC medical officer sent out their condolences to the bereaved families and the people of Liberia, saying that they are aware how difficult it has been for Liberians since the Ebola outbreak and hoped that the situation gets better as they are expecting experts in the coming days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several persons and institutions have identified with efforts to curtail the spread of the deadly Ebola virus by making donations with the Africa Motors contributing US$5,000 and Mr. Seymour Grann, popularly known as SG, contributing US$1,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These contributions were made through Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh, who is contacting individuals, organizations and businesses directly to encourage them to donate to help in the drive to end the presence of Ebola in Liberia. The amounts contributed were presented to Dr. Tipoteh in the form of cheques in the name of the Ebola Trust Fund. The amounts have already been deposited in the Ebola Trust Fund Bank Account at the Central Bank of Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In thanking Africa Motors and SG for their generous contributions, Dr. Tipoteh said that what they did is particularly appreciated because he knows only too well that the auto sales business, Hyundai, Toyota and Nissan, with which they are involved, is going through losses in income because of loss of sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In receiving the contributions, Dr. Tipoteh said that the donations show very strong commitment to Liberia because Africa Motors and SG are in Liberia to stay in good times and in bad times; therefore when times go bad, as now with the Ebola epidemic, those who love Liberia have to do something positive to make sure that Liberia stays alive. SG, in commenting on behalf of Africa Motors and himself, said that they will continue to do all that they can to make sure that Liberia overcomes the Ebola epidemic in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh concluded his appreciation of the donations of Africa Motors and SG by expressing the hope that individuals, organizations and businesses, especially those in better financial condition than the two donors, would show their love for Liberia by following the good example of Africa Motors and SG by making their respective contributions, in money and/or in-kind, to help stop Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development the Eliza Turner Memorial African Methodist Episcopal has demonstrated its commitment and provided US$1,000 to the National Task Force on Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the cash donation to the National Task Force on Ebola yesterday at General Service Agency (GSA), the Senior Pastor of Eliza Turner Memorial African Methodist Episcopal on Camp Johnson Road, Rev. Alvin E. Attah said the donation was an act of buttressing Government of Liberia's effort in fighting the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Attah said the entire African Methodist Episcopal Churches deem it necessary to make such donation to the National Task Force on Ebola to help fight the deadly Ebola virus which is claiming the lives of many people in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rev. Attah, the A. M. E. Churches in the country have unanimously joined the Liberia Council of Churches to actually fight the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Attah noted that besides the cash donation to the National Task Force on Ebola, the Church had also donated some Ebola materials to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Coordinator of National Task Force on Ebola, Mr. James D. Jallah has lauded the A. M. E. Churches for the great contribution made to the National Task Force on Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jallah disclosed that the Churches in Liberia have played significant role in the fight of the deadly Ebola virus. &quot;I am happy for the good example you people have set today by making a donation to the Task Force, &quot;Mr. Jallah applauded the A. M. E. Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the opposition Liberty Party (LP) has joined the fight against the deadly Ebola virus with the procurement of about US$ 5,000 worth of Anti-Ebola equipment and an amount of US$5,000 intended for two Non-governmental Organization (NGOs) to enhance their effort in the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty Party National Chairman, Cllr. J. Fonati Kofa, told journalists that the party is committed to the fight against the deadly disease and called on all LP partisans to do all within their powers to enhance the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Kofa said equipment and cash were raised by the party's members in the United States of America who have expressed concern about the lives and wellbeing of Liberians as the deadly virus rages on in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberty Party Chairman said with these donations, the party has set up a task force which is headed by the party's Nimba and Montserrado Counties' Senatorial Aspirants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Kofa further revealed that the LP Task Force is expected to work with the Party's coordinators across the country to carry out sensitization and a major public awareness campaign against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Kofa told journalists at a news conference in Monrovia yesterday that the anti-Ebola equipment that is expected in the country in few days will be distributed among health workers for safety and protective measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said upon the arrival of the equipment, the party will immediately commence its national sensitization against Ebola at which time the assortment of Anti-Ebola materials will be distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberty Party National Chairman used the occasion to call on all Liberians and foreign residents to put aside all their differences and join effort in the fight against Ebola, saying, &quot;Let's take this deadly virus seriously and take preventive measures because Ebola is real.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors at the ELWA Hospital have disclosed that ten persons who contracted the Ebola virus have been discharged after days of treatment at the ELWA quarantined center. Disclosing this on Tuesday when President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf visited the ELWA Hospital and other health centers in Monrovia and its environs, the Medical Director at the ELWA Hospital, Dr. Jerry F. Brown, said some of the Ebola victims at the quarantined center are responding to treatment while others' condition continue to deteriorate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Brown said they have discharged ten persons after being negative of Ebola and that the ten persons have been sent home to their families as they no longer show any sign of the virus. Dr. Brown stated further that six other persons who suffered the Ebola virus have been tested negative following treatment at the quarantined camp and will also be discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the ten persons being discharged following their response to treatment were part of 60 persons who were recently quarantined on the compound of the hospital and that some of those discharged include doctors and nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Brown appealed to government for the expansion of the quarantined centers as there are lots of affected persons pouring into the present camp as a result of the awareness campaign being launched in recent times against the virus. He said due to the influx of victims, there is now a capacity problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf described the discharging of the ten persons as good news for Liberia calling on those infested with the virus to go for early treatment. President Sirleaf said people who have contracted the virus must report themselves for early treatment to save their own lives and that of their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf's people have the chance of surviving if they report for early treatment. The Liberian leader said Ebola is claiming hundreds of lives in the country because of the continuous denial and cultural practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called on Liberians to stop the denial and take preventive measures as instructed by health authorities in the country. President Sirleaf at the same time, commended health workers at the ELWA Hospital for their sacrificial services to humanity and promised that government will do all to support them carry on their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf on Tuesday visited families of some of those killed by the raging Ebola virus who met their untimely demise while serving the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among areas visited was the home of the late Orishall Hindeh, a health worker at the Bomi Mines Hospital who died recently after contracting the virus. Madam Sirleaf later consoled Mrs. Miatta Hindeh and her three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sirleaf said the late Hindeh's services to the nation and society will always be remembered by the government and the people of Liberia. She presented a purse to the bereaved family and called on them to remain strong and courageous in these times of difficulties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1227 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groggy with the fanfare of our anniversary celebration but reflective and sober of the reality of the day, including the Ebola-made misery befallen upon our country, we bring not flowers to you on this day but our earnest advice on a very pivotal element of national governance, the media, and what we candidly think you must do not only to keep a better relationship with the Liberian media, but also act consistent with constitutional dictates of free speech, free press and other human freedoms. While we acknowledge you and everyone else are preoccupied with efforts to curtail Ebola, we are compelled to leave you with this subject of this memo during the observance of our 16th anniversary because this Ebola storm will certainly pass over and since this moment comes to us every 12 long months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, let us say, Madam President, that when you took the oath of office on 16 January 2006, you made a number of elating statements and vows, amongst which is the pledge to protect media freedom as a foundation for sustainable peace and development. It is not difficult to say why you promised to uphold press freedom and why you tried to minimally make a difference from the regimes of your predecessors: your much-vaunted 40-year political struggle was underpinned by a strong support from the media. And you fiercely agitated against your predecessors who saw the press as a launching pad of opposition agenda. Some media people and organizations took bruises because they trumpeted your views and bolstered your popularity and relevance in the Liberian political mosaic. You are therefore under moral obligation, and bounded by Constitutional imperatives, to go the extra mile and demonstrate significant difference in your free expression policy and commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading from the history of your struggle vis-&agrave;-vis the role of the media in it, much is expected from you. You have often advocated that press freedom is the mother of all freedoms. We recall President George W. Bush awarded you the coveted award of Freedom, for your &quot;personal courage and unwavering commitment to expand freedom...in Liberia and across Africa.&quot; Many have recognized you as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To whom much is given much is expected. Thus, you stand morally obliged, now as President of Liberia, to vanguard the cause of freedom of the press than any other Liberian President. That expectation, as far as the history of your struggle is concerned, is not comparatively satisfactory. Independent media watchdog groups, located here and abroad, have found your regime wanting of the full respect for media freedom. Research reports published indicate untold unfavorable actions--harassment, brutality, prejudice, malice--against media people and organizations. Harsh media laws, including &quot;criminal malevolence&quot;, are still on the books. Lamentations triggered by asphyxiating taxes on media-related goods have gone unheeded. Some &quot;regime unfriendly&quot; media groups are complaining of exclusion from certain state functions and bias in advertisement distribution by loyal or partisan officials and public institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More besides, Madam President, your government owes media entities in huge advertisement debts. The other day, the Ministry of Finance introduced the disadvantageous &quot;Golden Handshake&quot; scheme which only treated the symptoms of the problem and left the root causes. In the last couple of months, the advertisement debts have exceedingly ballooned and every media organization in the country is burdened--burdened without attention from your government. This is a bloodless decapitation of the media and it speaks volumes about your relationship with them also. Even with the national emergency caused by Ebola, the media remain critically impaired to play its role which is indispensable in the fight against the pandemic. We hope the emergency would mark the turning point in defraying your government's indebtedness to media and ease the burden so that we play our rightful play during this emergency and long after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Madam President, if Liberian media ever deserve kingly treatment at anytime in their existence, that time is under your administration. You are a longtime partner in the search for plural and freer society. They lamented the thirst for freedom, particularly media freedom. And more so, you are, or profess to be, a constitutionalist, a religious observer of the Constitution. You therefore certainly know that the pages of the Constitution bear bundles of political, social and economic freedoms, amongst which Article 15 which lavishly provides and protects the rights of Liberians to be informed, educated and enlightened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police brutality, official hatred (covert or overt), killer tax regime on media goods, scathing official criticisms and other notable disposition of your administration towards the Liberian media must be discontinued if you are to maintain and merit the epithet of &quot;protector of human freedom&quot; for which many find your regime culpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't understand the background from which our anniversary memo derives its focus, get a copy of publications on attacks on Liberian media by local and international organizations such as the Center for Media Studies and Peace Building and Freedom House respectively. There are bundles of violations ranging from SSS and other presidential military units' excesses against the media, police brutality, intimidation, harassment and scathing verbal censures of the media by officials of government representing the three Branches of Government. There is no report of punitive or disciplinary action against victimizers of media people under your administration just as it had been in the days of old.You are held in esteem for your administration to take such a drift. As the past holds it to you to live by what you preached, and the present now sifters your rhetoric, the future will bring upon you the final judgment on how history should remember you. You must endeavor to find your place on the good side of history: a true forerunner of free press and free speech. This calls for the end of complacency and self-confidence on what is perceived to be improved media environment under your administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That no journalist is in physical prison is no better than journalists languishing in the cells of &quot;unfriendly media&quot; appellation or in the furnace of advertisement discrimination and high taxes on exported media materials. We thought to provide you this counsel on our anniversary because our reflection on this day brings out the postulation that your administration stands a perfect possibility and chance to end the long night of captivity which the media have threaded over the years. The dawn sparked by your ascendency to state power is not yet turned into day for genuine free press as envisaged by the Constitution of Liberia. The break of sunny day for the media, for free press and free speech, is not long, though it is not automatic. It depends on your deliberate and forceful demonstration of the political will. You see the unprecedented support the media have been giving since the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. This is an expression of patriotism and good relations. This needs to be harnessed and promoted even after the virus is repelled and the nation return of normal. We are therefore hopeful you need this counsel of ours. Thanks for your time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When her new Partners album of duets was announced, an internet posting seemed to suggest she had been working on it with no lesser lights than Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Bette Midler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That post, however, was deleted and when Streisand made public the track details of the album this week, there was no sign of the trio of women stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have, apparently, been bumped' for an all-male line-up including Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel, Josh Groban and a beyond-the-grave Elvis. What an extraordinary collection of talent!' Barbra says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backstage dressers are, no doubt, relieved to be spared the combined demands of the divas at Barbra's forthcoming gigs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is to marry Robert Stewart (pictured with Camilla), an alumnus of the Scottish Eton', Fettes College, who serves with the Black Watch. His mother, Jane, says she is delighted'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt Camilla, who wrote for her university newspaper, took heed of her own relationship advice. In one column, she advised freshers: Dump your high-school boyfriend. Two years on, wisdom is infinitely better and sounder and your choice may not seem quite so rosy. Being in a relationship involves sacrifice: societies, friends and degree will suffer. Maybe it's worth it, maybe it's not, but avoid regret by thinking about it now.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British editor-in-chief of American Vogue, who was the inspiration for The Devil Wears Prada film, did, however, send along her daughter, TV producer Bee Shaffer, to the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She watched politely as Raftery donned a bobbed wig and oversized sunglasses to play her mother as he recounted her (fictional) problem with chronic constipation, brought on by the stress of putting Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wintour' then sang parodies of tunes, including the Disney hit Let It Go.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what attracts the 50-year-old actor (above), who plays the moralistic Earl of Grantham in ITV's costume drama, to the celebrated diarist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While outwardly an upright MP and happily married naval administrator, Pepys enjoyed a double life as a philandering roisterer and was once caught in flagrante with a woman in his pay by his wife, Elisabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm drawn to Pepys because he was a sort of one-man webcam, living through an incredible period in history and witnessing everything from the Great Fire of London to the Plague and the Restoration,' Bonneville says in the forthcoming edition of the BBC History Magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I could meet Pepys, I'd love to have asked him how he found the time to do so much: that is, go to work but still have a pint in Deptford, see some wench and then meet an ambassador all in one day!'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he can spare a few million, it would be perfect for former Labour minister Peter Mandelson, who enjoyed being thrashed with birch leaves by a 25-year-old banya keeper on his 2005 trip to Siberia with his chum Nat Rothschild.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa claimed its first European life yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the death toll climbing above 1,000 and the outbreak showing no signs of slowing, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pajares, a 75-year-old missionary, caught Ebola - one of the deadliest diseases known to man - while treating patients in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His condition was described as stable on arrival in Spain and it is thought he was given ZMapp, an experimental drug credited with the miraculous' recovery of two American aid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His body will be cremated today to prevent the virus spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, two doses of ZMapp were on their way to Liberia to treat two doctors - the first Africans to receive the drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development follows concern that the antibody medicine, which is grown in tobacco plants and has not been formally tested on humans, was being reserved for use on Westerners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian government said it is aware that the drug's safety has not been established, but that it had no option but to try using it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister Lewis Brown told the BBC: The alternative for not testing this is death, a certain death. This is not even the rock and the hard place for us. We think those who have been infected should be given the chance to have that tested on them if they give their consent to do so.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no conventional treatment or vaccine available for Ebola, and this outbreak being the worst ever, interest in ZMapp is high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But production is slow and with just 12 doses made, its US manufacturer says the supply is now exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is anger in Guinea that neighbouring Liberia has managed to secure some of the scarce stock. Assiatou Diallo, a nurse in the Guinean capital Conakry, said: The Liberians can count on their government but Guineans can only count on God in the face of Ebola.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, an ethics panel hastily convened by the World Health Organisation said that the size of the outbreak made the use of untested, and so potentially dangerous drugs ethical, provided certain conditions are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation previously admitted the disease, which causes internal and external bleeding, is out of control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queen's daughter is to carry out the four-day trip next month to Ethiopia and Tanzania, even though there are already two suspected cases there of the disease, which kills 90 per cent of its victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question of Her Royal Highness not going ahead with the visit,' a courtier tells me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one of the Princess Royal's friend adds: Anne sees her charity work as vital and will not be put off by something like this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is used to running the risk of catching illnesses when visiting hospitals and sick children in Africa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 people have died in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the Ebola outbreak was first reported in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the first European, Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares, 75, died after contracting the virus while working in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne (right), who turns 64 on Friday, will visit Ethiopia as president of Save The Children, a role she has performed for 44 years. She will inspect projects being undertaken in the country, where there is a high risk of terrorist attacks, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It advises against all travel to Ethiopia's Somali region, where there is a high threat of kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Princess will then fly to Tanzania, where she will see work by the Vine Trust, a children's charity of which she is patron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two suspected Ebola cases were reported in Tanzania last week, with a mother and son who had travelled from Uganda put in quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, a team of health workers were deployed at entry points to the city of Arusha in northern Tanzania in an effort to prevent Ebola entering the country. Neighbouring Zambia has banned all flights from countries affected by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though this outbreak has been in West Africa, the virus has been a scourge in the east of the continent since it was first identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan in the Seventies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian government said it is aware that the drug's safety has not been established, but that it had no option but to try using it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister Lewis Brown told the BBC: The alternative for not testing this is death, a certain death. This is not even the rock and the hard place for us. We think those who have been infected should be given the chance to have that tested on them if they give their consent to do so.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no conventional treatment or vaccine available for Ebola, and this outbreak being the worst ever, interest in ZMapp is high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But production is slow and with just 12 doses made, its US manufacturer says the supply is now exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is anger in Guinea that neighbouring Liberia has managed to secure some of the scarce stock. Assiatou Diallo, a nurse in the Guinean capital Conakry, said: The Liberians can count on their government but Guineans can only count on God in the face of Ebola.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, an ethics panel hastily convened by the World Health Organisation said that the size of the outbreak made the use of untested, and so potentially dangerous drugs ethical, provided certain conditions are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation previously admitted the disease, which causes internal and external bleeding, is out of control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SPANISH priest became the first European to die of the Ebola virus yesterday, as the World Health Organisation authorised the use of experimental drugs to fight the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miguel Pajares, 75, a missionary priest, died at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital yesterday morning after being repatriated to Spain from Liberia earlier this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died a day after Spain's health ministry said Madrid had obtained a course of the US-made experimental drug ZMapp over the weekend to treat the priest. Liberia said yesterday it planned to treat two infected doctors with ZMapp, the first Africans to receive it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brother Pajares had tested positive for haemorrhagic fever last Tuesday at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in the Liberian capital of Monrovia where he had been helping to treat patients infected with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his fellow workers at the hospital who had tested positive at the same time have since died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic, described as the worst since Ebola was first discovered four decades ago, has now killed at least 1,013 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria according to the World Health Organisation, which said it is ethical to use unproven Ebola drugs and vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was unanimous agreement among the experts that in the special circumstances of this Ebola outbreak it is ethical to offer unregistered interventions as potential treatments or prevention,&quot; said Marie-Paule Kieny, the World Health Organisation's assistant director general, after an ethics panel had published its guidance. A senior US health official assessing the crisis has warned that the scale of the outbreak in Liberia is overwhelming the capacity of the specialist isolation units that treat victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin De Cock, the director for global health at America's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said one of the country's two main treatment clinics, in Lofa County, had 80 patients in a 20-bed unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a Liberian health official disclosed that a woman who had contracted the virus had died in an ambulance while waiting to be admitted to the other main treatment centre in Monrovia, which is also full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr De Cock said that because many families were reluctant to report cases to the authorities, the number of people infected with the virus could be &quot;several times&quot; higher than the figure so far recorded. Health officials needed to start &quot;actively&quot; searching them out before they passed it to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an extremely severe situation and quite unprecedented,&quot; he told The Daily Telegraph in an interview in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Much more active searching for cases is required, with health workers going into the community and doing outreach work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak, he added, was expected to last for at least four to six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia - the most vulnerable nation because its health service was wrecked during its 14-year civil war - people travelling from infected rural areas had spread Ebola into Monrovia, which now had an &quot;independent, self-sustaining epidemic&quot; of its own and was a &quot;reservoir for infection&quot; for the rest of the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experimental, unlicensed drugs and vaccines can ethically be used in the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said following a meeting of experts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was announced after the death of a Spanish missionary who contracted the disease in Liberia. Miguel Pajares, a 75-year-old priest, was evacuated to Spain and was to be given the experimental drug ZMapp at Madrid's Carlos III hospital. A spokesman could not confirm whether the treatment had gone ahead before Pajares died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has become the first African country to announce it will use the drug. It plans to give it to two doctors who have tested positive for Ebola. There had been growing outrage that the drug had only been made available to two Americans and Pajares - all westerners who had been repatriated to their home countries for treatment. Only limited quantities exist, however. The California-based manufacturer of ZMapp, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said it had run out of the drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be pressure on the company to manufacture more following the WHO decision that its use, and that of other drugs yet to go through full clinical and human trials, is ethical in the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada is to donate 800 to 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine for use in Africa, the country's health minister, Rona Ambrose, announced last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Greg Taylor, deputy chief public health officer of the Public Health Agency of Canada, told Reuters that Canada owns a small quantity of the vaccine and would need four to six months to make a large amount. The vaccine has proved effective in animals but has never been tested on humans, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of 12 international experts convened by the WHO concluded it was ethical in the situation in west Africa to offer unproven treatments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they made clear high ethical standards must be observed. There must be complete transparency about the implications of the treatment, and patients and their families must give informed consent - which means they must understand the risks as well as the possible benefits. There must also be freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community, the WHO said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any experimental drugs will have to be given in effect as part of a clinical trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San Jose de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. All three had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola. The two other missionaries, from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who were not evacuated, have also died.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Africa's most populous city are scrambling to avoid mistakes that have helped fuel biggest epidemic in history</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was acting strangely even before he boarded the plane, hunching over in pain and avoiding physical contact with other passengers milling around the airport in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. Once airborne, he was sick several times. By the time he disembarked in Lagos airport - one of the busiest in the continent on a Muslim holiday - he was no longer able to stand unaided, diplomats and a witness told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who rushed forward to help didn't know Patrick Sawyer was in the final stages of an Ebola-induced breakdown, when the deadly disease is at its most contagious. More than 24 hours passed before the Liberian-American civil servant was diagnosed, allowing the virus to gain a toehold in Africa's most populous city and, for the first time ever, turning the threat of an urban outbreak into a nightmarish possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching three regional neighbours battle an eight-month long epidemic, Nigerian officials are scrambling to avoid mistakes that have helped fuel the biggest epidemic in history. In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, 916 have died, or around half of those who been infected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a potential fourth frontline has opened. A colleague travelling alongside Sawyer and a nurse who treated him have both succumbed to Ebola. Eight others have caught the disease in Lagos, and some 200 are under surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some unique challenges that have come up,&quot; said John Vertefeuille, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) response team in the city. &quot;The population density is a challenge and it's one we're looking at closely in terms how you do contact tracing. What Lagos has as strengths is there's a really talented workforce to draw on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil giant Nigeria has more resources than most to handle an outbreak but whether the situation spins out of control hinges on the Herculean task of tracing contacts in a crowded, freewheeling city of transients. It took 10 days to trace Sawyer's driver to Port Harcourt, a densely-populated city 600km south of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident has also highlighted a deeper culture of neglect when it comes to infectious tropical diseases that ravage West Africa each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, much has come down to chance. As a diplomat, 40-year-old Sawyer was whisked from the airport by a private driver. The company car - in which he was again sick, according to a Nigerian health official - was taken to a diplomatic compound, but wasn't used again because it was a national holiday. But public health workers were on strike, so Sawyer was taken to a small family clinic. There, the team who tried to save his life didn't initially suspect Ebola, or work with protective gear. At least one other patient at the clinic would later catch Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family hospital Sawyer went to was caught unawares. If it had been a public hospital, we would have had a much better chance of containing it,&quot; said John Oladejo, of Nigeria's Public Health Department, which in April sent dozens of doctors on an Ebola training course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has one doctor per 2,879 people, compared with one per 10,000 in Guinea or one per 86,275 in Liberia. &quot;We have a window of opportunity at the moment to contain it but there's no room for letting down your guard,&quot; said Chikwe Ihekweazu, an epidemiologist who helped stem an Ebola outbreak in Sudan a decade ago. &quot;It's not that we don't have the resources. The challenge is that there are things you have to do religiously every time you're dealing with a patient, and we're just not used to that level of diligence in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the noisy downtown street where Sawyer was initially hospitalised before being moved to a specially-built isolation ward, hardware salesman Emmanuel Uju sat on a ladder balanced over an open sewer which runs past his house. &quot;I don't shake anyone's hands anymore, but I truly have faith it won't spread more. They said you just need to separate the affected people to stop it spreading,&quot; he said, as yellow tricycles squeezed past cars, roadside food vendors and men wheeling barrels of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border controls - which have helped in seven previous Ebola outbreaks - are unlikely to do so in Lagos, whose population ebbs and flows with up to 4,000 new migrants each day. &quot;Ten years ago in Sudan there were no mobile phones, no Twitter. We drove around with in Landrovers with microphones telling people what to do. Today we really need to think about how to communicate with the public so that they know what to do without creating panic and anxiety,&quot; said Ihekweazu, who runs health information site http://nigeriahealthwatch.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another site set up within 24 hours of the first confirmed case, www.EbolaFacts.com, received 600,000 hits and 850,000 Facebook views within a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But technology is a double-edged sword. Yahya Balogun woke up to a 4am call last Friday. On the line, his mother demanded he stock up on salt - she had received a text message circulating with the &quot;cure&quot; of a hot salt bath before dawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two hours later she called again and asked, 'Yahya, have you done what I asked? Have you sent all your friends the message? This is a terrible disease and you need to pass on the advice',&quot; the taxi driver recounted. The rumour prompted two deaths this week from overdosing on salt water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health officials worry fear-mongering will distract from simple solutions needed to prevent contagion, in scenes reminiscent of some of the scare tactics amid an outbreak of the then little-understood HIV virus in the US during the 1980s. This week an epileptic man reportedly died this week after residents in Edo state thought his convulsions were a symptom of Ebola and refused to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see the fear in people's faces when we're going around door-to-door tracing contacts in the community. You have to explain to each person that there's nothing to be scared of - the likelihood of survival is much higher if you come forward in time,&quot; said Oladejo, the public health official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they ask, what about the Liberian, we tell them: that's exactly what he didn't do; he didn't come forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Goodluck Jonathan has declared a national emergency, and approved a 1.9bn naira special fund. Despite outbreaks of cholera and Lassa fever - a similarly deadly haemorrhagic fever - that kill tens of thousands annually, the country has no adequate isolation units, so officials rushed through orders for special tents and protective suits essential to prevent contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola's rarity means it is often overlooked globally too. Fewer than 300 Ebola specialists are stretched thin on the ground in three other nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just hope all our work is not in vain,&quot; Oladejo said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">714 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cellcom Telecommunications Inc, has announced new intensified measures to ensure that all of its more than 1 million subscribers are registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company says it has put in place the new measures in line with regulations from the Liberian Telecommunications Authority (LTA) and the Government of Liberia (GOL) in a bid to help reduce crime and prevent hoax calls, which are usually associated with numbers which cannot be traced to an owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New security measures put in place as part of the ongoing national state of emergency recently declared by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to fight the Ebola virus in Liberia is one of the key reason for the company's push to ensure the registration of all SIM cards. By ensuring the registration or blocking of all SIM cards will help prevent the use of unregistered SIM cards to make prank calls or carry out activities that could compromise national security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's spokesperson has also pointed to LTA's recent discovery of a large consignment of illegal SIM boxes using unregistered mobile numbers to divert much needed revenue from the GOL as another reason to ensure the registration of all SIM cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporate Communications Strategist Dr. Kimmie Weeks highlighted that use of illegal SIM boxes to reroute incoming international calls robs government of hundreds of thousands of United States dollars in revenue. Weeks observed: &quot;in these difficult times, when the government needs all of the resources it can get to fight this deadly disease, we cannot allow that revenue to be stolen by shady individuals and companies who are taking advantage of using unregistered SIM cards.&quot; He underscored that going forward, none of Cellcom's sales agents, stores, or point of sale centers would sell SIM cards or mobile devices without first registering the number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Cellcom's CEO Mr. John Vasikaran announced that the company would block all unregistered numbers on its system by August 7, 2014. &quot;We are painfully aware that many legitimate customers will be affected by the block, but we believe in abiding by the laws of Liberia and must support government's efforts to protect the people of Liberia.&quot; He noted that Cellcom had made the registration process free, easy and efficient to ensure what he called &quot;maximum results.&quot; Vasikaran encouraged customers to take advantage of the free registration process in order to secure the number and ensure the continuation of services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vasikaran said that as part of if its efforts to ensure the registration of all of its customers, Cellcom had invested in new equipment for all of itssales centers, point of sales centers, as well as sales counters at Total Service Stations across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to disclose that Cellcom had hired a large team of part time young people to carryout registration in local communities in Monrovia and adjacent areas. The move comes in a bid to enhance the registration process, while also providing temporary job solution to young people who are not in school because of the several weeks of mandatory shut down of the education system. &quot;We are doing everything we can to ensure that this process is accessible to all,&quot; Said Vasikaran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the registration process, Cellcom subscribers have been enabled to verify the status of their registration by sending a text message with the words &quot;REG&quot; to the number 5434 to receive confirmation of registration or to initiate the registration process from their mobile device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All new SIMs registered in August 2014 would receive 50MB of data and 50 minutes of voice calls for 24 hours. Vasikaran admonished subscribers to take advantage of the grace period and bonuses to register their SIM cards to prevent their numbers from being permanently blocked.Dr. Weeks encouraged Cellcom's subscribers to ensure the registration of their SIM cards to continue to benefit from access to Cellcom's services during the state of emergency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Declaration of State of Emergency - Is There Really a &quot;Threat&quot; or &quot;Outbreak of War?&quot; [opinion]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1230 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia effective as of August 6, 2014 for a period of 90 days. Under this State of Emergency, the Government will institute extraordinary measures, including, if need be, the suspensions of certain rights and privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, in making reference to the outbreak, the Liberian leader pointed out, &quot;our nation is currently affected by the deadly Ebola virus and the disease has now spread to eight counties. Liberia is among three countries experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of the virus, the larger ever since this virus was first discovered. It now poses serious risks to the health, safety, security and welfare of our nation. And beyond the public health risk, the disease is now undermining the economic stability of our country to the tone of millions of dollars in lost revenue, productivity and economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said although the government has taken measures through her by instructing that all non-essential government staff to stay home for 30 days, ordered the closure of schools, and authorized the fumigation of all public buildings and the shutting down of markets in affected areas and have restricted movements in other areas while the threat continues to grow. Ignorance, poverty, as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices continue to exacerbate the spread of the disease especially in the counties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is apparently based on this, the President and her government decided to declare this State of Emergency, to constitutionally empower the government take certain actions, to avoid any constitutional and legal crisis. Chapter IX, under the caption: &quot;Emergency Powers, which is being cited by the President states in Article86 (a(b): (a)The President may, in consultation with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro-tempore of the Senate, proclaim and declare the existence of a State of Emergency in the Republic or any part thereof. Acting pursuant thereto, the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantee contained in this Constitution and exercise such other emergency powers as may be necessary and appropriate to take care of the emergency, subject, however, to the limitations contained in this chapter. (b) A State of Emergency may be declared only where there is a threat or outbreak of war or where there is civil unrest affecting the existence, security or wellbeing of the Republic amounting to a clear and present danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsurprisingly, since the declaration by the President on this matter; there have been mixed reactions in some quarters. Some said the decision was not necessary at this time for economic reasons, while others said the provision of the constitutionality on such matter relating to &quot;war&quot; does not exist, as there is no threat, as would be in the case of insurrection or invasion, as experienced in the past. Others are looking at it from its economic implications at this time of hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just Friday a group termed the decision as &quot;poor political judgment.&quot; In a statement published by the DAILY OBSERVER, the group-The Institute for Research and Democratic Development (IREDD) termed as a &quot;misstep and poor political judgment &quot;government's declaration of a national state of emergency. President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf on Wednesday declared a &quot;State of Emergency &quot;and called for the legislative support in accordance with the 1986 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference last Thursday in Monrovia ,IREDD Senior Policy Director, Dan T. Saryee, noted that the declaration neither offered any result oriented solution to the economic reasons cited nor did it provide any direct solution to the eradication of Ebola from &quot;poverty stricken Liberians.&quot;The international research group pointed out that the government's decision will only exacerbate hardship, escalate vulnerability of the people to hunger and death by curable diseases- (Malaria, typhoid, diarrhea, etc.)and further deny the country of much needed revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">threatens one's freedom to information. Today, people are being prosecuted for this kind of war against others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now on the issue at bar as to whether or not the outbreak of this disease can be likened to a &quot;threat&quot; or &quot;outbreak of war&quot; against the nation, I will unequivocally say a BIG YES; the disease which has now claimed more than 200 lives is a threat or war against this nation. Therefore, action should be taken as would have been with armed conflict, to protect the lives of the citizenry. It is common sense that one of the functions of any government is that which relates to the welfare and wellbeing of its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent time, this government has come under attacks for not acting properly during the outbreak of the disease in the initial stage. The government is blamed for not being proactive something many believe could have averted this second outbreak, which is claiming more lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of this constitutional provision, the President acted properly by declaring this because this is as threat to the nation. The provision clearly and succinctly states, (b) A state of emergency may be declared only where there is a threat or outbreak of war or where there is civil unrest affecting the existence, security or wellbeing of the Republic amounting to a clear and present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A threat is defined as &quot;an indication of imminent danger, harm or evil; to threaten.&quot; From the legal perspective, the Black's Law Dictionary refers to threat as, &quot;an approaching menace;&quot; or&quot;a person of thing that might well cause harm.&quot; Indisputably, unlike in the initial outbreak, it is now accepted indisputably; it is now accepted that Ebola is here and that there is no cure for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make long matter short, Ebola is a threat to this country, as such; the ongoing war against its spread must be intensified. Again, the President acted properly in keeping with that constitutional provision to deal with this threat. However, our concerns should now be to ensure that the government does not abuse this declaration by unnecessarily restricting certain things, like freedom of the press and freedom of speech and that it would focus on what is needed such as the provision of the logistics, protective materials for health doctors, re-opening of major hospitals in this fight, as not all presently sick persons are affected by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the government, henceforth, should be mindful and careful of its communication strategies because this is necessary against the spread of this disease. There should be as &quot;CLEARING HOUSE,&quot; on all matters relating to the campaign before being sent for public consumption. We must realize that this is a &quot;threat&quot; and or an &quot;outbreak of war&quot; against the people of this country. The declaration of the State of Emergency is one thing, and doing those things necessary by the government in this fight is another thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me conclude by reiterating that the President acted properly in line with the Constitution, as this disease is a threat and war against the people of this country, but we must beware that saying something and doing otherwise is another thing. This requires us to act in a civilized and respectful manner, to keep the government's feet to the fire. The fight against Ebola must not be business as usual, and at the same time we should ensure that donations being made to curtail the spread of this pestilence, are used for the intended purpose. I REST MY CASE.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the second country, after Saudi Arabia, to impose such a ban in a bid to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no cure for Ebola, which has infected 1848 people since the outbreak was first reported in Guinea in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola's initial flu-like symptoms can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas like eyes and gums, and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">698 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The toll the Ebola virus has taken in the country seems to be of concern to members in the House of Representatives as they begin to have diverse debates on how to handle the issue not only in their constituents but in the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though at the 50-day sitting of the third session of the 53rd Legislature yesterday, representatives took a majority vote to empower the committee on health so that it monitors the funds being provided the National Task Force to fight Ebola while some lawmakers expressed that the situation needs to be addressed holistically.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some lawmakers even expressed dissatisfaction over how the Task Force is conducting itself especially as the National Legislature has concurred to set aside some $20 million in the National Budget to assist in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them, the fund earmarked will cause a serious injury to the budget and that would mean cut in salaries, allowances and other special benefits therefore the Task Force should be monitored not by itself but by others whose donations and assistance it relies on to perfect its duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among lawmakers whose points were made clear was that of Monstserrado County Representative George Solo who explained how the newest 4455 hotline just announced yesterday by the Task Force with text messages forwarded to individual cellphones is still making no impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Solo informed the House of Representatives' plenary how four dead bodies were lying in his slum constituency of West Point with no member of the Task Force responding to any of the calls and interventions made by him or his community members up until the time of the session yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even with the single hotline, no one responds and if the funds provided are to be used by the Task Force headed by the Chief Executive to respond to incidences rapidly; it should begin doing its job because the so disgruntled residents would begin taking defiant actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, if nothing is done to address the situation in my district which is the largest slum community in Montserrado County, I will take those bodies and have them laid before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs because we cannot have a hotline that nobody pays attention to,&quot; Rep. Solo told his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Lofa County Representative, Mariam Fofana, urged her fellow lawmakers to be serious about the spread of the virus. She told them that Ebola needs not come to their door steps before they join in the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Fofana said in her district alone over 60 persons have died already and at least 300 are suspected and using Lofa and Montserrado as the epic Counties and that lawmakers need to leave their comforts and begin to sensitize their electorates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of establishing a small group to monitor the funds provided, Rep Fofana said these are not times for the establishment of ad-hoc committees instead all must get involved if the Ebola virus is to be eradicated because it is not even time to speak about or apply the equal distribution theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said as for Lofa, it needs no awareness about the Ebola virus because the evidence is clear and speaks for itself but in counties that have not tasted the virus or are not hardly hit; should be the major focus and that should be the concern of the entire Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She further called on the residents in areas that are experiencing the Ebola virus to continue encouraging their communities to seek medical attention and give dignity to their dead while in those counties that have not experienced the virus should take the preventive measures seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the House has accepted a majority vote to invite the NEC to its tomorrow session to explain the reasons for rescheduling the special senatorial elections because even as it suggests the postponement of the election, it is already in violation of its own guidelines regarding campaigning therefore the plenary needs explanation to the way forward before granting President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request to hold a consultation with that body on the matter but the Liberian Senate has discussed and decided to send similar communication to its committee on elections to advise the plenary on how to proceed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">806 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the donation of medical supplies and equipment to Liberia to intensify the fight against the deadly Ebola virus that has killed hundreds of Liberians, it has been disclosed that three Chinese public health experts will arrive in the country today to join in containing the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking yesterday when the People's Republic of China handed over consignment of medical supplies and equipment to the Government of Liberia, Chinese Ambassador, Zhang Yue said the Chinese experts are coming to Liberia to help in the fight against the virus that has engulfed the Mano River Union Basin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amb. Yue said a consignment of medical supplies and equipment that were sent directly to Monrovia from China was brought in by a special cargo plane Monday afternoon and includes personal protection equipment, medical instruments, sanitizer, disinfectants, medicines, non-contact infrared thermometer, which are all urgently needed in the battle against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amb. Yue said the Chinese government and people have been a staunch supporter to the Liberians to contain Ebola virus with concrete reactions. He said at the time of the first outbreak of Ebola, China swiftly provided US$20, 000 of cash aid and a batch of medical supplies valued US$1 million RMB Yuan (about 1 hundred and 60 thousand US Dollars) to Liberia respectively in March and April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese envoy said the Chinese medical team stands fast and remains at its post to continue providing medical care and treatment. He added, &quot;Chinese companies in Liberia also donated materials to communities nearby to fight against Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amb. Yue noted that with Ebola further spreading quickly and constituting great challenges to Liberia, as Liberia's firm and reliable partner, China has once again made quick response to the appeals of Liberia and WHO by providing this batch of emergency aid materials and dispatching public health experts to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in order to meet the urgent need of Liberia and make every effort more efficient, the Chinese government has launched the Emergency mechanism, simplified the procedures and sent a special cargo plane for quick delivery. He added, &quot;And we experienced all the same when we worked with the counterparts of the Liberian National Task Force on Ebola these days. All these highlight that we in China always worry and concern about what Liberians do and vice versa, which usually happens between brothers and friends indeed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that his country and Africa have always been a community with a shared destiny adding, that the people of China and Africa have been holding the other as their sincere friends and helping each other in distress for a long time. &quot;We clearly remember that during the deadly earthquakes which occurred in 2008 and 2010, many African countries including Liberia rendered timely assistance to us. We are also very moved that in the wake of severe earthquake hitting China's Yunnan Province last week, Madam President Sirleaf sent a condolence message to our President Xi Jinpng and Chinese people when she heavily engaged herself in leading the campaign against Ebola,&quot; Amb Yue among other things concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf lauded the Chinese Government for the assistance saying that the timely donation of the drugs and medicine to Liberia is a further step in the sisterly ties between Liberia and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said China has always been a good partner to Liberia especially at the time that country is faced with its own challenges. She said the latest assistance to Liberia by the Chinese Government is an extra mile and that the assistance comes at the time that the country is in a national tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China has gone one step further by recognizing the urgency of our situation and has promptly come to our assistance in these great times of need. Please convey our appreciation and gratitude to your President that Liberia is a reliable and prominent friend to China,&quot; the Liberian leader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sirleaf expressed sorrow over latest report of the spread of the Ebola virus into several communities in Monrovia and its environs that were not infested. She said the people are still not listening to Government on preventive measures while others are still denying that the virus exists in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has visited several health facilities in Monrovia and its environs. The President on Tuesday visited the Redemption Hospital, John F. Kennedy Hospital and the ELWA Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf during her visits, lauded health workers who have returned to work to save lives despite the threat posed by the raging Ebola virus. Madam Sirleaf then encouraged the health workers to remain strong in the battle against the virus and promised that government will be with them in meeting their immediate needs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) hosted a meeting to discuss the possibility of using experimental drugs on patients. However, health officials are divided as to the merits of using drugs that have not been tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO officials have declared the outbreak, which has killed at least 961 people, becoming the worst in recorded history, a global public health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the current cases are in the three west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos has 10 confirmed cases, up from seven at the last count. Two patients have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In America, three church workers - including the husband of a missionary being treated for Ebola in Atlanta - have been quarantined in North Carolina after returning from west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwandan authorities said they had quarantined a German student with Ebola-like symptoms. The patient was the first to be tested in Rwanda since the outbreak began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement came following reports that a child who died in a Guinea border town just before Christmas last year was the &quot;patient zero&quot; whose illness began the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two-year-old boy was from Gu&eacute;ck&eacute;dou, a jungle village which lies on the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone, and was reportedly declared the first case of the outbreak by investigators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials say Miguel Pajares, who contracted virus in Liberia, has died after being repatriated for treatment</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish missionary who contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia and was repatriated to Spain for treatment has died from the virus, health officials in Spain said on Tuesday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miguel Pajares, 75, arrived in the Spanish capital last Thursday on a plane sent from Spain to Liberia, making him the first patient in the deadly outbreak to be evacuated to Europe for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors said he was weakened and feverish but in a stable condition. He was taken to Madrid's Carlos III hospital where he was due to receive the experimental treatment ZMapp. A spokesperson from the hospital said he had died on Tuesday morning but would not confirm whether he had actually received the experimental treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajares succumbed to the virus just as Liberia announced that it would be receiving doses of an experimental drug, believed to be ZMapp, to give to two doctors who tested positive for Ebola, making them the first Africans to receive the treatment in the fast-spreading outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday it backed the use of the experimental drug to treat Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news came amid growing outrage that the drug had only been made available to two Americans and Pajares - all westerners who had been repatriated to their home countries for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the California-based manufacturer of ZMapp, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said it had run out of treatment after responding to a request from an unidentified west African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San Jos&eacute; de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. All three had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola as part of their work with the San Juan de Dios hospital order, a Catholic humanitarian organisation that runs hospitals around the world. The two other missionaries, from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who were not evacuated, have also died in recent days from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajares arrived in Spain with Juliana Bohi, a nun born in Equatorial Guinea who holds Spanish nationality, who tested negative for the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decision made after a Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares died after contracting the virus in Liberia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experimental, unlicensed drugs and vaccines can ethically be used in the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said following a meeting of experts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was announced shortly after news of the death of a Spanish missionary, who contracted the disease in Liberia. Miguel Pajares, a 75-year-old priest, was evacuated to Spain and was due to be given the experimental drug ZMapp at Madrid's Carlos III hospital. A spokesman could not confirm whether the treatment had gone ahead or not before Pajares died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has become the first African country to announce that it would use the drug. It plans to give it to two doctors who have tested positive for Ebola. There had been growing outrage the drug had only been made available to two Americans and Pajares - all westerners who had been repatriated to their home countries for treatment. Only limited quantities exist, however. The California-based manufacturer of ZMapp, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said it had run out of treatment after responding to a request from an unidentified west African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be pressure on the company to manufacture more, following the WHO decision that its use, and that of other drugs yet to go through full clinical and human trials, is ethical in the current outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of 12 international experts convened by the WHO concluded it was ethical in the situation in west Africa to offer unproven treatments with as yet unknown efficacy and adverse effects, either as treatment or prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they made clear high ethical standards must be observed. There must be complete transparency about the implications of the treatment and patients and their families must give informed consent - which means they must understand the risks as well as the possible benefits. There must also be freedom of choice, confidentiality, respect for the person, preservation of dignity and involvement of the community, the WHO said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was unanimous agreement that there is a moral duty to also evaluate these interventions (for treatment or prevention) in the best possible clinical trials under the circumstances in order to definitively prove their safety and efficacy or provide evidence to stop their utilization,&quot; the statement went on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any experimental drugs will have to be given effectively as part of a clinical trial, therefore. The group said ethical ways of gathering data from their use in the difficult setting of an Ebola outbreak needed further discussion. There also needs to be further consideration of which experimental drugs and vaccines might be used and a fair way of distributing them given that demand is likely to outstrip supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San Jos&eacute; de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. All three had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola as part of their work with the San Juan de Dios hospital order, a Catholic humanitarian organisation that runs hospitals around the world. The two other missionaries, from Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who were not evacuated, have also died in recent days from the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">724 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union is increasing by an additional <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>8 million its efforts to contain the spread of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. This is the fourth increase of EU assistance for this crisis. It brings the Commission's aid in 2014 to fight the Ebola epidemic, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has just declared a &quot;Public Health Emergency of International Concern&quot;, to <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>11.9 million. In addition, a second &quot;European mobile laboratory&quot; will be deployed in the coming days, most likely to Sierra Leone, to provide essential support to diagnostics and testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are determined to help prevent the further spread of the deadly epidemic. Many lives depend on our immediate assistance. Our support will ensure urgently-needed healthcare and the strengthening of preventive measures through our partner organisations which are helping around the clock to provide life-saving assistance to the victims,&quot; said Kristalina Georgieva, EU Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, stated: &quot;Saving lives and providing further support to West Africa is now more than ever an urgent priority. We have therefore decided to mobilise today's additional assistance from the European Development Fund. New medical supplies and the mobile laboratory will help to meet the pressing needs in the region and improve capacities to detect the virus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional EU funding will provide immediate healthcare to the affected communities and help contain the spread of the epidemic. The aid will be channelled through the European Commission's humanitarian partners on the ground, including UN agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian experts from the Commission have been deployed to the affected countries to undertake the assessment and coordinate with the health authorities and humanitarian partners on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola epidemic is taking a devastating toll in the four affected countries, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. To date, the outbreak has seen 1711 cases and 932 deaths, including many health workers. Cases have been suspected in other West African countries but tested negative. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this is the largest recorded outbreak in terms of cases, deaths and geographical coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission allocated humanitarian funding in response to the Ebola outbreak as early as March this year. The response has already been scaled up - most recently in July. The funding has enabled WHO, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to sustain and expand their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is also working closely with EU Member States within the Health Security Committee, keeping them informed about the latest developments and trying to synchronize measures to protect Europe. A travel advisory leaflet was issued by the Health Security Committee and is available in all EU languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Centre for Disease Control recently updated its risk assessment on Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven European specialist teams of the European Mobile Laboratory (EMlab) project for dangerous infectious diseases have been dispatched to Gueckedou in Guinea in late March, with a mobile laboratory to provide support with viral haemorrhagic fever diagnostics, rapid analyses of samples and confirmation of cases. The second unit is already in the region and will be deployed in the coming days, most likely to Sierra Leone (Freetown).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1100 tests have so far been conducted, including samples from Guinea and Liberia; more than 400 of them were positive. The EMLab project is a European initiative funded by the European Commission. It includes partners from Germany (Bernhard-Nocht-Institute, Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, University of Marburg, Robert-Koch-Institute), Italy (Istituto Nazionale Malattie Infettive Spallanzani), France (INSERM/Pasteur Lyon), UK (Health Protection Agency PD Laboratory), Hungary (Hungarian National Biosafety Laboratory), Switzerland (Spiez Laboratory) and Slovenia (University of Ljubljana, Institute of Microbiology and Immunology).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new project is being prepared to provide additional detection capacities and training (<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>2 million from the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">A Major Press Conference By Hon. C. Clarence Massaquoi, the Director of Police, On Ebola-Related Issues [interview]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2406 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and Gentlemen of the Press, thank you for your response to our invitation to this Major Press Conference on developments of the Ebola outbreak as it relates to the State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last few days, our beloved country and people have been engulfed with terrifying news of contamination of wells and water sources in various communities in Montserrado and Margibi Counties in the wake of the prevailing Ebola disease. This latest development has created panic in our people, and in some instances, leading to mob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1st Incident - Alleged Poisoning of a Well inKpor Town, Margibi County</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 3, 2014, an individual identified as Edwin Dagbe, aged 27, was rescued by personnel of the Armed Forces of Liberia and subsequently turned over to the Liberia National Police, who was being beaten by community dwellers on suspicion of poisoning and contaminating wells in Kpor Town community dwellers alleged that Mr. Dagbe had in his possession one nose mask, one pair of hand gloves and one syringe. However, due to the large crowd which had gathered at the Police depot in Kpor Town, suspect Dagbe was immediately transferred to the RIA Police Detail for safety.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the arrest of the suspect, the Liberia National Police collected water samples from the well for test analysis, while the well was ordered shut down pending the outcome of the test analysis. Ladies and Gentlemen of the press, because of the importance the LNP attached to this grave allegation, sample of the water was immediately sent to the National Standards Laboratory and the LNP Forensics Unit for testing. We want to report that test result from the lab revealed that water from the well contained lower concentration of Aldehyde which is a form Formaldehyde. As a result, the Police Forensic Unit considers the test as being inconclusive in that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It lacked information on the percentage of concentration of formaldehyde which would render the water either contaminated (poisoned) or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also shows that the water taken from this well had a pH of 6.52 at 24.4 degree centigrade, while normal water pH is reported to be between 6.5 to 8.5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test further reveals that aldehyde (an element of formaldehyde) is usually found in water sources closer to swamps and sandy areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the test result indicates that all water has its own chemical substances; these substances were however, not mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the test result also mentioned a low concentration of aldehyde thereby rendering the water nonlethal and harmless for human consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the Police does not have sufficient evidence to support the suspicion of the community dwellers that Mr. Dagbe attempted to poison or contaminate their well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2nd Incident - Alleged Poisoning of the Farmington River</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second incident report of alleged water poisoning, citizens of Marshal in Margibi County, on August 4, 2014, arrested a 48-year-old man for being in possession of a mineral bottle which contained substances they claimed he intended to use to contaminate the Farmington River. After the suspect was apprehended, he was turned over to the Liberia National Police for investigation. During Police investigation, the accused denied the allegation and claimed that the liquid substance was a herbal concoction prepared by him for his toothache. The liquid was tested and found to contain a high concentration of aldehyde with organic impurities which content was positive with the alcoholic and carboxylic content negative. Also, the pH level was shown to be 4.70 at 25.5 degree centigrade.He is currently detained at the RIA Police Detachment for further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3rdIncident - Alleged Poisoning of a Well on Lynch Street</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third incident of alleged well poisoning was reported on August 5, 2014 on Lynch Street in Monrovia, involving alleged suspects Arthur Jallah and Tony Gray. Alleged suspect Jallah was rescued by the Police from an angry crowd in the compound of the Anderson Funeral Home after being accused by a worker of the Funeral Home only known as David of attempting to poison or contaminate a well. Alleged suspect Gray for his part denied being on the scene during the incident and stated that he last saw his colleague Jallah only the day before. Upon receiving the report, LNP officers visited the scene at the Anderson Funeral Home. Information gathered during our investigation indicates that suspect Jallah was seen standing in close proximity to the Funeral Home, starring at the back of the building, when his accuser, David, alarmed that he was attempting to poison the well thereby attracting a large crowd which began to beat him mercilessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his rescue and search conducted on his person by the Police, no suspicious substance was found on the accused.Nevertheless,the Police suspected him to be either a drug addict or probably suffering from some mental imbalance, as he made several incoherent statements during his interrogation. Meanwhile, the accused sustained serious injury to his head as a result of the mob violence and is currently undergoing medical treatment. Suspect Gray however, continued to maintain that he was not present on the scene nor was he involved in any alleged attempt to poison the well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4th Incident - Poisoning of a Well in Barnesville, Old Folks Community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 6, 2014, at about Noon, suspect Lewis Teah was turned over to the LNP by members of the Bardnersville community Watch Team who rescued him from some community members who were interrogating and attempting to mob him on suspicion of poisoning a well. When the Police searched him, suspect Teah was found in possession of a plastic bag containing some tablets and a brown powdery substance. During our investigation, the suspect claimed that the tablets were antibiotics and the powder was used to medicate fungus on his toes. The powdery substance and tablets have been turned over to the LNP Forensic Unit for laboratory testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and Gentlemen of the press, you will note that from the test results and statistics that were conducted by all the above mentioned testing centers, there was no evidence to substantiate the widespread speculation that water sources, such as rivers and wells, were ever poisoned. We do not know the origin of such scaring information which engulfs the city a fortnight ago that resulted to mob violence against some of our citizens howbeit innocently. The Police are therefore, warning rumormongers and negative talebearers to refrain from putting other citizens in harm's way through their wagging and poisonous tongue, for the Police will not hesitate to arrest and charge to court all such persons when caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent times, there was widespread speculation that the death of twenty-five (25) persons in Dolo's Town, Margibi County, was as a result of poisoning. However, following Police investigation, we found no evidence to support these speculations; rather, our investigation revealed that the dead persons died one month after participating in the funeral of two persons who allegedly died as a result of the Ebola virus. Therefore, and in keeping with the Health Ministry's advice, the Police has resolved to treat all deaths as Ebola-related until cause of death is established otherwise by the Ministry through the Health team of the National Ebola Taskforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Police (LNP) has observed with a great deal of concern the sudden hike in the prices of essential goods and services, especially transportation in and around Monrovia and elsewhere in the country. This is regrettable, disheartening and very alarming to see that some unscrupulous business owners, both local and foreign, will use a crisis situation such as the Ebola outbreak to profiteer at the expense and detriment of the general public, especially our poor citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would like to caution and/or warn those engaged in this wicked and selfish practice to immediately desist, especially those in the commercial transport sector, as the Police will enforce to the letter the Vehicle and Transport Laws, especially as it relates to &quot;Improper Carrying&quot;, whether it is passengers or goods. We want to remind the driving public, particularlyregular commercial drivers and those using their private vehicles to transport passengers and goods, that we are in a State of Emergency in the fight to control and eradicate the deadly Ebola virus from our country; and as such, the Police is calling on everyone to strictly adhere to all pronouncements by the Ministry of Transport regarding the number of passengers to carry in their vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any person failing to adhere to the Transport Ministry's pronouncement in this regard, when caught, will be arrested, vehicle impounded and forwarded to court for prosecution. As you may be aware, only three (3) persons are allowed to ride in the back seat with one in the front. This is a means of preventing the rapid spread of the deadly Ebola virus which is contracted mainly through body contact. Also, but more importantly, the issue of violent protests and riots where groups of citizens for one reason or the other decide to infringe upon the rights (free movement) of commuters is now becoming very alarming and must therefore, stop now!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Police in conjunction and collaboration with other agencies are deeply involved in the fight against eradicating the Ebola disease from Liberia, there are some citizens, especially the youth, who have elected to be non law abiding and have elected continuously engage in wanton violent rioting by setting up roadblocks at various locations at the expense of peace citizens. The Police will like to emphasize and reemphasize to all of our citizens that on August 6, 2014, the President of the Republic of Liberia, Madam Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, declared a state of emergency in keeping with Article 86 A &amp; B of our constitution. In that declaration of a state of emergency, the President said, among other things, that certain rights and liberties under the constitution will be suspended in the interest of public health and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with the Act and Statutes creating the Liberia National Police (LNP), the Police has the authority to protect life and property and to maintain law and order. Therefore, the public, especially the youth, is hereby strongly warned to immediately desist from all forms of rioting and/or mob violence and setting up roadblocks anywhere in the Republic of Liberia. Any one or group of persons caught rioting or engaging in any act of mob violence will have themselves to blame when the Police arrives on the scene. Let the word go forth that effective immediately, the Police will deal robustly with anyone caught setting up roadblocks in any part of the country, especially in Monrovia, as a form of rioting and/or engaging in mob violence. Again, you will have yourself to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government will not tolerate people engaging in unlawful acts which challenge its authority to govern. A state of emergency means nothing else but a state of emergency. You must all therefore, remain very law-abiding during the period of our state of emergency. Therefore, please do not test the resolve of the Police to be very robust and uncompromising in maintaining the peace and protecting the safety and security of the state and its people. Accordingly, there will be no demonstration and/or rioting. You have been warned!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another point of serious concern to the Liberia National Police is the sudden increase in mob violence, since the outbreak of the Ebola virus. In recent times, the Police have received and responded to several reports of mob violence in and around Monrovia and elsewhere in the country. To date, the Police have rescued five (5) accused persons from such situation. In addition, in perpetrating these mob violence, roadblocks are erected, which obstruct the free flow of traffic, including ambulances that are taking Ebola suspects and other patients to the Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to combat and contain this public menace, and in the face of the escalation of the Ebola causatives, the Police have developed a special operational plan codenamed &quot;Operation Rescue 1 &amp; 2&quot; whose functions are to: 1. provide protection for health workers and ambulances going to collect patients and dead bodies, as well asto protect the cremation team from the ministry of Health; 2. Containment: Erect necessary barricades (roadblocks) and checkpoints - restricting movements (human and vehicular) to communities declared Ebola-infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Police would like to extend our thanks and appreciation to the Government of Liberia for its support to the special operations plan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of the People's Republic of China has donated several health materials valued at US$1.7m to boost up government's efforts to fight the deadly Ebola virus that has claimed the lives of many Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the items on behalf of the Chinese Government yesterday, the Chinese Ambassador to Liberia, Yur Zhany, said the donation is the Chinese people's way of identifying with Liberia as the country strives to fight the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ambassador Zhany, the items include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), disinfectants medical gloves, medical thermometer as well as drugs intended to suppress the Ebola virus in human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Zhany said the Chinese did not only identify with Liberia but other countries that are fighting the virus such as Guinea and Sierra Leone. He said the total package to the three countries is valued at US$5m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese envoy explained how the Chinese cargo plane carrying the items which comprised of disinfectants, protective gears as well as drugs to suppress the virus had earlier landed in Guinea and Sierra Leone before arriving at the Roberts International Airport (RIA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coordinator of the Ebola Task force, James Dorbor Jallah, promised that the items will be stored at the Freeport of Monrovia and be ready for prompt distribution to hospitals and clinics based on the advice of the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items on behalf of the Liberian Government, the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sylvester Grisby, expressed the government's gratitude and said the government and people of the Republic of China have always been friends of the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the National Task Force to fight Ebola headed by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has commenced series of meetings with the plenary of the Liberian Senate to provide up-to-date briefings about the status of Ebola in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the meeting yesterday, Health Minister Walter Gwenigale disclosed that there is a possibility that Liberia will receive the experiment drug that was used to stabilize the two American doctors now in Atlanta, United States who contracted the virus while serving humanity in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told members of the Liberian Senate at the Capitol Building among other things that he has been able to contact the company that produced the drug and it has given some advice in that direction; contacting the American Forestry Development Authority who consented to the drug coming to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of closure of medical facilities, he said medical facilities were closed down by default and that measures are now in place to ensure that health workers return to work while the facilities will be chlorinated and prepared to receive patients again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Gwenigale also announced the appointment of Tolbert Nyensua as Director for Ebola who according to him will deal with all such issues and provide up-to-date responses when and if necessary noting that so far, 20 persons from Montserrado and 30 persons from Lofa Counties have died after contracting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Chief Medical Officer, Bernice Dahn, will move on to addressing the normal health care delivery adding that since the Ebola outbreak the Ministry of Health had not paid much attention to its regular health matters including other sicknesses or diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Minister Gwenigale said even though there is no cure for the disease but if a person arrives at a center at the early stage, it is best for them as well as the medical practitioners. &quot;Those whose counties the virus has yet not reached please do not come to Montserrado or any other county. If you do not have business, do not come here if you do not want your community invested. If that means turning people away from your towns, do so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health Minister said treatment centers are being established around the country and that has been one of the health team's major problems in taking patients suspected of Ebola from their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gwenigale said the burying of dead bodies have been turned over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs because nobody wants people to be buried in their communities and it is the Internal Affairs that deals with city mayors and superintendents therefore that aspect is now settled with the aid of the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming his new duty, Director Nyensua told members of the Liberian Senate that chemical substance put in water wells as well as Ebola vaccine and bitter cola are rumors that need to be dispelled and noted that the hotline for Ebola is now 4455 which can be used by LoneStar, Cellcom and Novafone subscribers linking to 30 phones and it is a 24-hour service that takes care of all situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense Minister, Brownie Samukai said all those wishing to commute from Gbarpolu, Bomi and Cape Mount Counties must stay at the Klay Checkpoint for 21 days and submit to a check-up by the health workers there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned, &quot;The task force will not tolerate any acts of setting up road blocks in the name of check points because no one is authorized to do so. You are in a State of Emergency; do not test out limits. People are dying; bodies need to be removed and traffic needs to move; please do not take the laws into your hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;Districts in Lofa County are in the process of being quarantined as the security has no intention of allowing the queues of vehicles at the St. Paul Bridge linking Bong and Lofa to pass and that no one is also authorized to allow anyone pass the check point until the 21-day observation elapses. I hope no one calls to allow special access to anyone because we will refuse; this is no disrespect to anyone. The better we cooperate the easier it is for all of us,&quot; he maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint task force members present at yesterday's briefing along with the members of the Liberian Senate have concurred to cut the South Eastern region off from the rest of the country since in fact the virus has not surfaced in that part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">River Gee County Senator, Fredrick Cherue recommended that trucks be made available to take food items and other needed supplies to the counties in that region so that residents there will not be enticed to leave and come to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the National Democratic Coalition is also calling on the government to speed up the incentive package to medical practitioners in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a seven-page press statement which they outlined reasons why the State of Emergency declared will harm the economy made available to this institution yesterday, the coalition of Liberia's social democrats concluded by also requesting the provision of adequate protective support for health workers across the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIBERIA'S government is cremating the remains of possible Ebola victims without testing whether they have the virus, leaving relations unaware if they may be at risk of the disease as well.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current guidelines to stop the spread of the outbreak in west Africa recommend that anyone who dies from an unconfirmed illness be tested for the Ebola before the body is disposed of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As well as helping health officials to monitor the number of fatalities, a positive result means the virus may well have been passed on to friends and relations. But, such is the chaos in Liberia's health service, ministry of health undertakers are being instructed simply to take them directly for cremation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When The Daily Telegraph accompanied one such team on their collection duties last week in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, the four bodies collected during the course of an afternoon were driven straight to the crematorium at the nearby town of Marshall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was despite the fact that some of the families who reported the corpses for collection had done so in the specific expectation that medical tests would be carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gap in the protocols has alarmed aid agencies, which say it risks fostering a false sense of security among victims' relations, many of whom are reluctant to admit that a loved one may have died from the disease anyway. If the test is negative, it stops them being ostracised by the rest of their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very important to keep a record of who has actually died from Ebola and who hasn't, because without reliable data, it is very difficult to assess the spread of the disease,&quot; said Lindis Hurum, emergency coordinator with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Also, for a family, it important to know what their loved one has died from. If they aren't being told that, then there is less incentive for them to report the bodies to the authorities in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of the outbreak in March, health officials across west Africa have fought an uphill battle in getting the public to report the deaths. Failure to do so has been one of the main reasons for the spread of the illness, as carriers can potentially infect dozens of other people. Under normal guidelines, if a person is found to have died from the virus, health officials try to identify an entire &quot;contact chain&quot; of people to whom it may have been passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of a proper testing regime came amid growing concerns about the Liberian government's handling of the crisis. The country's health service was 95 per cent destroyed during the 14-year civil war that ended in 2003. Officials admit that the Ebola outbreak has caught them unawares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the disease first broke out, hospital and clinical staff were not equipped with gloves nor other protective equipment to treat patients, resulting in several becoming infected. That led to a number of hospitals and clinics being shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian president, apologised on Saturday for the high death toll among the country's health care workers who have fought the Ebola outbreak, which has killed nearly 1,000 people in three countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She pledged up to &pound;11 million ($18 million) for the Ebola fight, part of which will be given to health workers to help with insurance and death benefits, to fund more ambulances and to increase the number of treatment centres.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pope Francis used unusually strong language to condemn the actions of Islamists in their continuing campaign against minorities in Iraq yesterday and called for an end to violence in the name of God. A high-ranking special Vatican envoy is due to leave for northern Iraq today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his traditional Sunday blessing, Francis said the news from the country had left him &quot;in dismay and disbelief&quot;. Without referring by name to the Islamic State (Isis), whose jihadists are largely responsible for the persecution, the pope deplored reports of &quot;thousands of people, including many Christians, driven from their homes in a brutal manner; children dying of thirst and hunger in their flight; women kidnapped; people massacred; (and) violence of every kind.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;All this gravely offends God and humanity. Hatred is not to be carried in the name of God. War is not to be waged in the name of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraqi authorities have reported that Isis has kidnapped hundreds of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority after seizing the north-western town of Sinjar. Up to 100,000 Christians are thought to have fled for their lives towards Iraqi Kurdistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent reference to the US-led air campaign to deliver relief to the civilians fleeing Isis, Francis said: &quot;I thank those who, with courage, are bringing succour to these brothers and sisters, and I am confident that an effective political solution on both the international and the local levels may be found to stop these crimes and re-establish (the rule of) law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the pope named Cardinal Fernando Filoni as his personal envoy to Iraq. Plans are also being made for a meeting in Rome, probably in September, of all the Vatican's diplomatic representatives in the region to organise support for those who have been forced to flee the jihadists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 68-year-old Filoni is a Vatican heavyweight who was considered a candidate for the papacy in the runup to the election last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an earlier stage in his career, he served for six years as the Holy See's ambassador to Jordan and Iraq during the final stages of Saddam Hussein's regime. Filoni was among the few foreign diplomats to remain in Baghdad during the bombing of the city by US-led forces in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pope's spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, said the cardinal would travel to Iraqi Kurdistan, where the majority of Christian refugees are sheltering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview published in Avvenire, the daily of the Italian bishops' conference, Filoni appeared to blame the situation in Iraq on the US-led invasion 11 years ago. &quot;Since 2003, the situation has never improved,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe (Pope) John Paul II was right when he warned the political leaders at that time to rediscover the paths of a peace that was not (found) and for (the lack of which) we are suffering these consequences today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pope also discussed the fighting in Gaza, which he described as &quot;a war that cuts down innocent victims and does nothing but worsen the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also mentioned Ebola, which has killed close to 1,000 people in west Africa, calling on his followers to &quot;pray for the victims of the Ebola virus and for those who are fighting to stop it&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to combat the deadly Ebola virus in the country, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare Authorities have demonstrated its commitment and begun major screening of inhabitants at Klay Checkpoint, Bomi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nurse Registrar at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Gabriel Moore, said nurses and doctors are screening individuals at the checkpoint, and if anybody's temperature is found to be high, such person will not be allowed to cross; rather will go back to his or her destination for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with this paper, Mr. Moore said since the nurses and doctors started the screening process, they have not discovered high temperature or fever in those people who have been screened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Moore told the Inquirer that the nurses and doctors will work effectively and efficiently to make sure that people are prevented from the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the passengers who spoke to our reporter, Ma Hawa said she was so much happy for the screening process because she has spent three days at the Klay Checkpoint without food while stranded but after the screening, she was allowed by the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and the Liberia National Police (LNP) to cross and come back to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son, just imagine, I left nothing with my children in Monrovia; right now I am confused as to whether they are getting something to eat because I did not leave anything with them, &quot;Ma Hawa stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the marketers who also spoke to our reporter said they were stranded because of the situation they encountered at the checkpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We bought our goods and barely had our transportations to go to Monrovia but to our utmost surprise, AFL and LNP prevented us from crossing the checkpoint at Klay while coming from Bomi and Grand Cape Mount Counties because of the State of Emergency,&quot; marketers averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the marketers, they have spent some days at Klay Checkpoint without food and had sleepless nights, something they described as gruesome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile some of the vehicles were seem crossing the checkpoint after the screening of individuals by the authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in a special meeting held with some health workers across the country thanked them for their endless strides in combating the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf stated that the health workers are truly working in the spirit of Florence Nightingale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian President admitted to the scores of health workers over the weekend that indeed the Government was not prepared for the virus; however she thanked them for putting their country first and helping to tackle the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She acknowledged that the Government is working vigorously to examine what went wrong in the virus outbreak which was thought to be eradicated in March of this year resurfaced in April and has now reached epidemic proportion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader used the occasion to address some of the concerns that health workers are faced with ensuring them that in due course their demands would be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking under the banner of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia, the Secretary General of the Association, George Williams, said an increase in number of Ebola Centers, sufficient ambulances, sufficient safety gears, death benefits, among others were what the workers demand to have a cordial relationship with the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Related development, the Liberian Senate on Friday, unanimously endorsed President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's request to the Upper House to concur with the imposition of a State of Emergency as part of measures to contain the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday of last week, the House of Representatives deliberated and crafted a Resolution to endorse the State of Emergency that was declared by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in accordance with Article 86(a)(b) of the Constitution of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Liberian Senate convened an emergency session at which time members of that august body endorsed the imposition of the State of Emergency after more than several hours of intensive deliberations on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers said there was a dire need to impose the State of Emergency as the outbreak of the Ebola virus poses serious danger to the country and its people. Even before the President's decision to impose the State of Emergency, the Senate has been pushing for this describing the Ebola virus as a threat to the survival of residents of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following several measures by the Liberian Government intended to curtail the deadly Ebola virus which has killed hundreds of persons in Monrovia and other parts of the country, President Sirleaf in a communication dated August 7, 2014 requested the National Legislature to concur on the institution of the State of Emergency in the spirit of cooperation that exists amongst the three branches, giving the gravity of the prevailing situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Liberian Senate has concurred with the House of Representatives in passing a resolution on the imposition of the State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two thirds of the membership of the Lower House on Friday passed the resolution as required by the Constitution, with 52 for, three against and two abstentions in a Special Session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the threat posed by the Ebola virus, government of Liberia over the weekend announced the deployment of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) to major entry points in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister, Lewis Brown, announcing the measures said government's latest action is intended to prevent further spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1079 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just few days ago I wrote an article about rumor-mongering in the Liberian society, in the wake of many rumors as efforts are continuing to curtail the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in the country. I said at the time that rumoring in communication is considered one of the aspects of informal communication in the grapevine. In the Liberian society, it is generally believed in some quarters that &quot;for some rumors, there are always truth in them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That article was captioned: &quot;Rumor-Mongering: What Makes It More Difficult?&quot; In that piece I stated how rumors spread with rapidity in the Liberian society, something that can be likened to bush fire, but what is more difficult is the tracing of the source of origin. Many times, we are faced with all kinds of rumor, but to get the origin source of such a rumor is something that remains a puzzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the difficulty involved in tracing the origin of the rumor or the person who initially began to make such a claim that spread to many, I concluded by saying that we should never expect to know where they come from, but live with it, as it would always be, &quot;they say,&quot; &quot;someone told me, ' or &quot;I heard it from someone or some people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumors and gossips, as I stated previously, are considered as one of those kinds of communication in the informal sector of communication, sometimes referred to as the grapevine. Allan J. Kimmel, a psychology professor at Fitchburg State College, who gave meaning to rumors and gossips, says, &quot;Rumors are what people say among themselves to try to make sense out of what's going on around them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, this means that as people continue to face a given situation like Ebola, one should also expect the spread of rumor, which one book defines rumor as, &quot;general talk not based on definite knowledge; mere gossip; hearsay,&quot; or &quot;an unconfirmed report, story, or statement in general circulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so in the face of this Ebola and measures announced to curtail its spread, there is high possibility that rumor would find its way into the public discussions on the subject matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, with the existence of the Ebola virus, there have been all kinds of rumors. As stated before, one of which is that some individuals have been poisoning wells to add to the number of deaths. It is claimed that they confessed that there are more than 200 given such a task to increase the number of deaths during this time of Ebola. However, no one can say to whom those reportedly arrested in connection have confessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this society, as I stated in my previous article that rumor-mongering during the time of crisis is not strange to the Liberian society. I even recounted that many years ago during the time of the civil conflict, it was rumored that there would be some rain and that if the rain touches anyone, misfortunate would befall the person. Also, it was rumored at some point that everyone should eat potato greens to prevent a calamity that was expected to happen to the nation at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, it was at some point it was rumored that the wells in the city would go dry for three days, therefore, residents should fetch enough water those days to avoid facing water shortage. Particularly, as I even ruminate on it, saw Monrovians rising at dawn in their numbers fetching water. The scene at the time in the city can be likened to a stampede, as residents went helter-skelter to get water for the three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, just a day after the end of a three-day fast and prayer organized by the Liberian Council of Churches and also buttressed by the Liberian government, whether this can be described as rumor or not, certain information was widely circulated that &quot;there is a message&quot; that Liberians, in their fight against the spread of Ebola, people should bathe with salty hot water before 6 a.m. on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, the field of journalism teaches one to be skeptical. It is said in this profession that skepticism is one of the hallmarks of Good Journalism. Therefore, whenever I am told something, I at times received it with skepticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Saturday morning, I was awakened by a text from one of my daughters, Benetta from New Kru Town. On her text to me, she said, &quot;Good morning Dad; here is a blessed and spiritual message going around this morning from God. Tell somebody to boil water for you now and put salt in the first pot to drink and the second pot to bathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as I was completing reading the text, my other daughter, Wleyonnoh, woke me up and gave similar message. Because she knows that I am always skeptical, she pleaded with me to take this one seriously. For this particular daughter, she always hears all kinds of rumors and shared them with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing about the issue of rumor-mongering in this society, I was still skeptical of this and decided not to lend credence to it or take it seriously. But what convinced me, or really persuaded me, most was an early morning call from one of the senior staffers of THE INQUIRER Newspaper, which I head and Mr. Augustine Choloply, a third year student at the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law at the University of Liberia told me similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, while going home on Friday evening, Mr. Choloply told me that a security guard at a local clinic, wanted to publicize a message on Ebola to the Liberian people. With this, I advised him to get the information for today's publication. And so when he called me and told me that this was the same message the security guard wanted to share with the Liberian people, I became convinced and hurriedly took my hot salty bath, as directed by the message which was widely circulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is true that many are aware of this latest situation, I decided to share it because as it is generally believed in the Liberian society that for some rumors, there are always truth in them,&quot; especially at the end of a successful fast and prayer and the continual prayers and fasting by some of our mothers under the rain and sun at the Fish market, I accepted this and bathed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I came to work yesterday and shared this with the News Editor of THE INQUIRER, Timothy Seaklon, he amazingly shouted and said, &quot;So you did it too. You are an intelligent and educated person; you should not have done that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me conclude by saying that if this is really a MESSAGE from God, I am happy that I was a part of that BLESSING; conversely, if it is mere Liberian rumor, then, it is saddened that I have fallen prey to this. But all in all, I feel the sense of relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Explaining the Need for a State of Emergency [opinion]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Augustine Konneh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1794 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for declaring a State of Emergency in Liberia hardly requires an explanation in the face of the gravity of our predicament. The Ebola epidemic is a very serious health crisis that demands extraordinary measures to contain it. The normal exercise of the authority of the government is not adequate to the challenge post by the potential of the virus to spread through person to person or people to people contact. Hence, the need for Emergency powers declared by the Executive and thus ratified by the legislature. These powers will enable the government to take urgently needed action to localize the disease in those communities in which it appears to have a high incidence by quarantining its inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides this, there are a number of other urgent regulations and measures that are needed to stave off the epidemic. It is to be noted that the other affected countries Sierra Leone and Nigeria have also declared states of emergency while the Republic of Guinea has ordered its borders close to Sierra Leone and Liberia for the purpose of swiftly and effectively preventing the spread of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state of Emergency is not declared lightly. It is not necessarily declared just for political reasons. In many cases it is declared to deal with natural catastrophes such as floods, earthquakes, forest fires where they occur, uncontrollable outbreak of infectious disease etc. For example, in the United State, a friendly nation there are fairly frequent declarations of States of Emergencies in areas visited by such catastrophes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt, it is also to be noted that States of Emergencies are sometimes declared ostensibly to grapple with problems of serious political instability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manifesting a high incidence of public violence. It is no secret that sometimes some governments have sought to use such emergency to serve their own interest rather than the public's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the current State of Emergency is definitely not motivated by any political consideration. Rather, it is driven by a genuine concern for our well-being as a people. There is no fear that our civil liberties will be indiscriminately suppressed. Nevertheless, certain conditions that arise or may arise may require that certain measures be allowed to override certain considerations of civil liberties e.g. the interdiction of people traveling or moving from one area of the country to another (done at check points set for the purpose of either screening or simply ordering such persons to return to their communities or other points of departure): securing entrance into premises to check for infected carriers, quarantining dwellings or whole communities, imposing stringent public sanitation ordinances, allocating and spending funds that may not heather to have been earmarked for the aim of health, commandeering private transportation and private building for public use, introducing when and if necessary price control on basic commodities, compelling the admission and treatment of the sick to hospitals and clinics because the admission of the sick even for ailment like malaria is even difficult due to the fear that is entertained by nurses and other hospital staff, arresting and detaining rumor mongers who tend to spread false information that may engendered panic or spur resistance to ordinances and other restrictions. It may also involve the closing of borders from incoming and outgoing traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and other measures are example of what the government is authorized to impose during the period of the emergency for the health and well-being of the nation. It is full hardy to try to resist such measures in at our safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has already done much to contain the outbreak of the disease. As stated in an earlier article on the virus,(i) the government of Liberia has ordered the closing of all schools until further notice. (ii) It has allocated funds to the Ministry of Health for deploying health workers to spray the environment with disinfectants, (iii) it has instituted measures for checking on people from house to house to observe whether there are some with the symptom of the disease, and where there is, so to bring them to quarantine facilities for treatment. (iv) The Ministry of Health has also been conducting public education and awareness on the dangers of the virus as well as the necessary measures to avoid contracting and spreading it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(V) Measures have also been adopted to isolate the locations where the incident of infection appears to be high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(VI) Other measures include the cremation of corpses of those who are suspected to have been infected with the disease. (VII) In addition, the government has decided to reduce the staff of the various ministries for a month to the level of essential staff sending the others home on a paid follow for the period. (VIII) The Ministry of Commerce has also been instructed to allow the importation of receptacles (buckets) needed for the cleansing of hands in chlorinize water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond this, worshipping centers (Churches and Mosques), shopping centers, businesses and entertainment places are required to provide facilities for the washing of hands in antiseptic solution as well as to announce and post notices of the danger of the Ebola epidemic. Some of these entertainment centers now play music that carries awareness messages about the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President attended a meeting of the leaders of the affected states in Conakry, where it was decided to quarantine the inhabitants of the meeting points of the three nations. Besides, President Johson-Sirleaf decided to forgo a meeting of African Heads of States with the United States that took place between August 4 and August 6. This was to allow her to devote her full attention to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislatures have organized youth groups to further the awareness campaign as well as carry some needed resources to their constituents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is suggested that the following additional measures be taken: (1) the urgent removal of all refuge in public places (2) sanitation inspection of compounds and yards (3) inspection of water supply to ensure that water for domestic uses is not contaminated (4) regular inspection of markets to ensure that minimal standard of sanitation are observed with regards to the cleanliness of the stalls , the receptacles for produce and other wares sold as well as the packaging of items. It may be advisable to use can food for now. In the face of the hardship being experience by some it might be advisable to help provide some food stuff such as rice, oil and can fish and vegetables (5) the strict enforcement of public sanitation ordinances in the city of Monrovia and the rural areas particularly as its relate to urinating, defecating and spiting in public places (6) the need to go back to the source of the epidemic, and prohibiting the loose handling of dead animals in the wild and the consumption of it. All wild meats that is publicly sold should be tested for contamination and regulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of Emergency is for a period during which it is still possible to go to court to challenge the validity of those measures that may be perceived as not pertaining directly or indirectly to the cause of the State of Emergency. It is for the court to decide on the legality and validity of such specific measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of Emergency may not be used to impose unwarranted hardship, not pertaining to the cause for which the Emergency was declared. In addition, before its expiration the Executive is required to go to the legislature for a review of the State of Emergency, the measures enforced under its prevention, and its possible extension. The Legislature may decide to extend the authorization and ratify the measures or may decide to end its life, if it deems it no longer necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important thing to remember, however, is that the government has no intention of using the authorization to further its own interest or that of any segment of the citizenry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We therefore need to have faith in the benevolence of our government. Let us fully cooperate to enable us to constrict the spread of this devastating disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next point is the response of the nations of the international community as well as relevant international organizations such as the WHO, FAO, UNICEF, WFP, UNESCO, THE EU etc. The WHO has, already announce the donation of $100m towards the campaign to stop the virus and bring relief to those affected by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director has called the epidemic an international Emergency of great concern to all. For if it is not successfully halted it has the potential of becoming a pandemic threat in these day of extensive travel and international interaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Saudi Arabia a visitor to Sierra Leone returned with disease and died in the hospital in Jeddah soon after. Two health workers who returned to the United States are still held in isolation in a hospital for observation and experimental treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO Director has called for all nations to donate money and other resources to stem the spread of the virus. We support the appeal and count on all to make substantial donations in money and other resources to a profoundly humanitarian cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who have promised aid are the United States of America whose President announce that the United States will send experts and health workers as well as provide resources to fight the virus, the governments of the Peoples Republic of China and South Korean. The African Development Bank has also announce the donation of $60m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wish to express our gratitude for these donations and efforts. Our gratitude also goes to Medecins San Frontiers and their partner, the Samaritan Purse, the Center for Disease Control and the National Institute of Health of the United States for much needed technical support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affected countries should now seize this opportunity to establish adequate preventive health facilities including the training of people of public health as well as an increasing number of primary care physicians. A little later efforts should be directed at providing incentives to medical graduates to specialize in fields like oncology, endocrinology, cardiology, internal medicine, etc. The countries in the Mano River Union for instance can pull their resources together to create facilities in public health and the provision of well equipped hospitals. There is also a great need for diagnostic laboratories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The currently affected countries are determine to do their part: for it is they who are ultimately responsible for the health and well-being of their peoples. However, being developing nations, there is only so much they are able to do on their own. We therefore, hope that a global awareness campaign about the crisis is being mounted around the World. FIGHT ON LIBERIA!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST THURSDAY, THE Minister of Information, Lewis Brown, while addressing the regular press briefing of that Ministry disclosed that several medical facilities which closed down as a result of the deadly Ebola virus would have resumed full operation since last week Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MINISTER BROWN SAID training, and in many cases retraining of medical staffs and healthcare workers has been ongoing. He said the JFK completed their training since Thursday and was to reopen its doors beginning with the Emergency and the OBGYN sections on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE STATED FURTHER that the hospital would've become fully operational by last weekend. Similar training according to Minister Brown began at the Redemption Hospital on Thursday after decontamination and fumigation of the facility. He added that the Redemption would've opened its doors on Friday beginning with the Out-Patient Department, OBGYN and the Emergency sections but that the Redemption Hospital is expected to become fully operational by today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE ELWA Hospital, according to Minister Brown, decontamination and fumigation began last Wednesday, while training for healthcare workers and medical staffs commenced on Thursday of last week. He added that the doors of the ELWA Hospital are expected to be reopened by today. Brown said similar training and detailed procedures to limit the risks of exposure of healthcare workers are ongoing across the country and have been completed in various clinics and community health centers. He said these safety measures and protocols will be monitored and supervised by the Liberia Medical and Dental Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE ADDED THAT the 80-bed Ebola Treatment Facility at ELWA will be completed in a week and a team of Ugandan healthcare workers, including two doctors are in the country, courtesy of the WHO, to partner and train Liberians who are managing the ELWA Treatment Center with support from the MSF and the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE INDEED WELCOME the reopening of these health facilities in and around the city as this will greatly assist in the fight against this vicious deadly Ebola virus that is bent on devastating the country. Consequently, the reopening of these major hospitals will help cater to citizens and residents of Liberia who are experiencing illnesses that might not be Ebola-related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS THE GOVERNMENT of Liberia (GOL) is working with the various hospitals and relevant groups for the reopening of these hospitals, it's hoped that proper mechanism will be designed and put into place for the proper management of the nation's health care delivery systems. This we believe will facilitate the treatment of all kinds of illnesses since all illnesses are not necessarily Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE WE ARE concerned about the wellbeing of those involved and engaged with the nation's health care delivery system, all must be done to ensure that they are provided tangible protective gears to work in a manner in which not every dead person is a victim of Ebola. If every dead body is considered an Ebola victim with proper screening the number of Ebola victims might swell to an unprecedented number that might give the right figure of Ebola victims or Liberia might top Sierra Leone and Guinea in terms of the number of Ebola deaths.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh, the internationally renowned economist and 2011 Presidential Candidate, is insisting that the State of emergency is only to end the presence of the Ebola virus in Liberia. He is bringing to the attention of the people of Liberia and friends of Liberia the true meaning of the Declaration of the State of Emergency made by the President of Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Tipoteh, the President declared the State of Emergency, as heard from herself in the media, only because it is necessary to put Ebola out of Liberia quickly. Dr. Tipoteh says that he is raising this concern because there are on-going discussions between the government and investors on the possible sale of additional oil blocks, as the State of Emergency exists. In fact, Dr. Tipoteh is calling upon the government of Liberia to end these discussions on the additional oil blocks now so that the government can focus on uniting the people of Liberia around the struggle to put an end to Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh, in his statement to the media over the weekend, went on to say that the Ebola crisis provides an opportunity for the government to unite all Liberians, be they Christians, Muslims,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people of other religions, Civil Society Activists and business people, in the patriotic drive to save Liberia from the Ebola virus. Dr. Tipoteh is hopeful that Liberians can take advantage of this opportunity to demonstrate their love for Liberia by working together to stop Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Liberians work together to overcome this deadly Ebola virus, Dr. Tipoteh says that Liberia will have a better future, especially for the children of Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Liberia's GSM companies, LoneStar Cell over the weekend has given US$ 5,000.00 to some of its subscribers who were to travel to the United States of America (USA) but are unable to go due to the Ebola outbreak in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making remark at the 'Da You Time Na Promo' Ceremony held at Lonestar Cell office in Congo Town, Dr. Laurence Bropleh said, &quot;We are not only the wildest in terms of our courage and present across the country but also in our promotion because there are no manipulations as other places may be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bropleh pointed out that the LoneStar Cell &quot;Da Your Time Na Promo&quot; has changed the lives of many Liberians who had never dreamt of being winners of the company's raffle; he also said when one wins he or she is not to be given money but due to the situation the company has to change its plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned that an option has been given and that when one wins he or she travels to few places inclusive the US supported by the LoneStar Cell but it should be understood that they do not control the US Visa, and foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bropleh said, &quot;You are all dignified Liberians, well positioned as young people, and love your country, and you have tax to return to this country; unfortunately that was not convincible enough to the US Consular that you all were denied Visa, and we are silent about that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that all the winners are important to LoneStar Cell, and because of being the winners they have decided not to break the rule neither to worsen it but to enhance the rule so that it is sensitive enough to still support their winners in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bropleh said the US$ 5,000.00 each that they have decided to give to their winners is a full compensation package that is inclusive of their air tickets, time in New York, and everything that was made promised to them (winners).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that whenever LoneStar Cell says it, it does it, and it's why they support the Liberian nation in the fight against the deadly Ebola outbreak in the country and they took the lead by sending out text messages to the public that caused the company about US$ 30, 000.00 for each batch of message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bropleh said they are doing it because they support the government, Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare (MOH&amp;SW), the call center, and the entire country because Ebola is no discriminatory; he also encouraged everyone in the LoneStar Cell network to play and be a winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part one of the winners named, Darlington G. Paye said US$ 5,000.00 is money to change his life from one stage to another; he also said that LoneStar Cell has done what he had never dreamt about in his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paye appreciated LoneStar Cell for transforming his life by making him one of their lucky &quot;Da Your Time Na Promo&quot; winners, and also urged every Liberian to stop the doubt about LoneStar Cell raffle because it's simply true and fair, he concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Management of China Union-Liberia has temporarily shut down its operations in Bong mines in Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company took the decision over the weekend following report of six suspected cases of Ebola at the company's run hospital in Bong Mines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our reporter who visited the company's operational site in Bong Mines over the weekend, the company on Saturday morning issued a communication calling on all 'black workers', seemingly Africans to stay at home from work for the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers were asked to remain home due to report that an unknown pregnant woman who was on her way to the hospital fell along the road and died. When the woman was taken to the hospital for examination, she was discovered to be a carrier of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was based on that, that the management decided to allow all black workers to stay away from work for the day pending a follow-up examination by authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare that was immediately contacted by the management of China Union on the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the issuance of the communication to the representative of the Workers Union headed by Mr. Sumo Kesselly, the workers immediately moved to block a train from leaving the company site and shut down the plant on ground that the management's action was only targeting the black workers and not Chinese workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worker's leaders said management did contact them as representatives of the workers before taking the action and the communication was not clear to them relative to the payment of their salaries while away from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Kesselly, the president of the Worker's Union said during a social dialogue meeting organized by the Labor Commissioner of Bong County, Mr. Nyeswah Davis held between the Management and the Workers Union to resolve the situation, in the afternoon of Saturday, August 9, 2014, another report came from the hospital saying that additional five new cases of suspected Ebola victims have been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon receiving the latest report, the management finally announced the temporarily closure of the company's operation in Bong Mines for time indefinite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that time, management and workers' representatives formed part of the decision to suspend the company's operations with the understanding that the company will withdraw their first communication and a new communication will be jointly produced for the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the new communication the company committed herself to workers to the payment of the regular monthly salaries beginning with this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the salary for August will be paid on August 29; a weekly communication from the management will be sent to update on activities of the company and Ebola situation and workers will be informed as to when to return to work when there is improvement in the Ebola situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest commendation was taken as the Honorable Supreme Court of the Republic of Liberia galvanized support at the Judiciary in joining the fight against the dreadful Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We encourage all Judges of Courts outside the Temple of Justice premises and Magistrates to implement the steps taken by the Honorable Supreme Court to reduce its staff,&quot; the release is quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities of the Liberia National Police (LNP) have vowed to deal with protesters and those setting up road blocks as a means of expressing their grievance in the wake of the State of Emergency imposed by the Government of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a major news conference yesterday in Monrovia, Police Director, Chris Massaquoi, said while the Police in conjunction and collaboration with other agencies are deeply involved in the fight against eradicating the Ebola disease from Liberia, there are some citizens, especially the youths, who have elected to be non- law abiding and have elected to continuously engage in wanton violent rioting by setting up roadblocks at various locations at the expense of peace citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police through its boss, Col. Massaquoi reminded Liberians that on August 6, 2014, the President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, declared a State of Emergency in keeping with Article 86 A &amp; B of the Liberian Constitution. &quot;In that declaration of a State of Emergency, the President said, among other things, that certain rights and liberties under the Constitution will be suspended in the interest of public health and national security,&quot; the police boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Massaquoi said in keeping with the Acts and Statues creating the Liberia National Police (LNP), the Police has the authority to protect life and property and to maintain law and order adding, &quot;Therefore, the public, especially the youths, are strongly warned to immediately desist from all forms of rioting and/or mob violence and setting up roadblocks anywhere in the Republic of Liberia. Anyone or group of persons caught rioting or engaging in any act of mob violence will have themselves to blame when the Police arrives on the scene; let the word go forth that effective immediately, the Police will deal robustly with anyone caught setting up roadblocks in any part of the country, especially in Monrovia, as a form of rioting and/or engaging in mob violence. Again, you will have yourself to blame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the Government will not tolerate people engaging in unlawful acts which challenge its authority to govern. He said a state of emergency means nothing else but a state of emergency. &quot;You must all therefore, remain very law-abiding during the period of our state of emergency. Therefore, please do not test the resolve of the Police to be very robust and uncompromising in maintaining the peace and protecting the safety and security of the state and its people. Accordingly, there will be no demonstration and/or rioting; you have been warned,&quot; Chris Massaquoi added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the issue of mob violence, the police boss said the sudden increase in mob violence since the outbreak of the Ebola virus is of serious concern. He said in recent times, the Police have received and responded to several reports of mob violence in and around Monrovia and elsewhere in the country. &quot;To date, the Police have rescued five accused persons from such situations. In addition, in perpetrating these mob violence, roadblocks are erected, which obstruct the free flow of traffic, including ambulances that are taking Ebola suspects and other patients to the Hospital,&quot; Mr. Massaquoi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the police action, Col. Massaquoi said in order to combat and contain this public menace, and in the face of the escalation of the Ebola causatives, the Police have developed a special operational plan codenamed &quot;Operation Rescue 1 &amp; 2&quot; whose functions are to provide protection for health workers and ambulances going to collect patients and dead bodies, as well as to protect the cremation team from the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the police have erected necessary barricades (roadblocks) and checkpoints restricting movements (human and vehicular) to communities declared Ebola-infected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When our reporter who visited the hospital yesterday asked why there was no one coming in for treatment, the security guard who was at the emergency entrance said most people are afraid since the Government of Liberia announced that medical workers should take all cases as Ebola cases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Catholic Hospital is still closed to the public. When asked why the hospital is not open when the Government has asked that all hospitals should be opened on Monday, the Chief Medical Officer of Catholic Hospital, Dr. Bomah, said the hospital was closed due to procedure and that the hospital will use that same procedure to open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bomah told this paper at his residence in the hospital compound, that the Government was asking their own hospitals to open but not the Catholic Hospital. The hospital compound is deserted except for those who are staying in the compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter who also visited the country's biggest referral hospital, the John F. Kennedy Hospital observed that it is still closed. When the Public Relations Officer was contacted and asked why the hospital was still closed, he declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the ELWA Hospital that is located on the Robertsfield Highway, it is partially closed due to the Ebola virus that affected two of its doctors. However, part of it is still opened only to pregnant women. When asked to speak with the administrator, the security said he was not around and that there was no one around to speak with the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at the hospital, our reporter observed that there was a lady pleading with a security guard to allow her car in the compound to enable her sister get treatment. The lady was denied entry on grounds that the hospital is not fully yet opened, as it was only treating pregnant women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Liberia through the Information Ministry last week announced the reopening of hospitals in the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) says it has taken note of the extraordinary measures put in place by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to combat the Ebola epidemic, including the 90-day state of emergency and the deployment of the Armed Forces of Liberia to assist with quarantine efforts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope and scale of this disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is unprecedented, with over 1,600 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola now recorded in the three countries. Well over half of the people infected have died. The number of new cases continues to grow, with over 500 confirmed or probable cases now reported in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued following the declaration of the state of emergency the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Liberia, Karin Landgren, noted that stopping Ebola requires Liberians to work together as one community. Washing and disinfecting, caring safely for the sick, tracing all contacts, and making burials safer are all collective actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said UNMIL is committed to doing all it can to help stop Ebola in Liberia. The mission is working in support of crisis logistics, with many partners: thirty-five United Nations staff are now providing logistical support to the Ebola response, and the state of emergency will not affect our operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that UNMIL field offices in every county are working closely with Superintendents and County Health Teams on county-specific needs, noting, &quot; I have seen some very good work at county level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement pointed out that UNMIL Police and Force continue to provide back-up security to the Liberia National Police; and I would like to express special appreciation to those nations contributing troop and police personnel to UNMIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNMIL Radio continues to inform all Liberians, spreading facts and dispelling rumors. The dissemination of Information on Ebola prevention and response is critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the World Health Organization (WHO) at the forefront, the statement said the UN family and international partners in Liberia are working tirelessly to support the Government-led response, including support for surveillance and contact tracing, medical expertise, and material resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that in direct support to the clinical response, WHO has lent support to case management and UNICEF has provided materials for isolation units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recognize the exemplary contribution of NGOs, many of whom are on the frontlines of the epidemic. To keep us working, my top priority is the health of all UN staff, Liberian and international, the UN Secretary General Representative said..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concluding, the SRSG emphatically said &quot;Ebola can be defeated if all Liberians unite to make it end. UNMIL remains committed to working for continued stability and development in Liberia and the region. Ebola must be rolled back for Liberia to continue on its path of peace, stability and development. I am confident that Ebola can be ended in Liberia, something which will also keep the rest of the world safer. The United Nations will give this our steadfast support.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY SOPHIE BORLAND HEALTH CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE EBOLA outbreak in West Africa has been declared an international health emergency by World Health Organisation officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said a co-ordinated international response was urgently needed to stop and reverse the spread of the virus, which is the worst outbreak of Ebola the world has ever seen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak began in March it has claimed over 930 lives and affected more than 1,700 people Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But experts said it was unlikely to turn into a global health pandemic and the threat to the UK remains very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and causes diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, a temperature, followed by kidney failure, internal bleeding and bleeding from the nose and ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no cures or vaccines and this particular strain has a 55 per cent mortality rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, outbreaks have been confined to rural areas, but this one is sweeping through cities in previously unaffected countries such as Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts think that traditional burial methods, whereby mourners touch and kiss the bodies of the deceased, may be behind its rapid spread. Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation, an agency of the UN, said the announcement was a clear call for international solidarity'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.' No travel or trade bans have been enforced, but WHO advised anyone who has come into contact with Ebola patients not to go overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also recommended that officials at airports in affected countries take the temperatures of all passengers leaving and make them fill in questionnaires to check for potential victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past two days alone there have been 68 new cases and 29 deaths, WHO says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only the third time in recent years the organisation has declared an international health emergency, after swine flu in 2009 and the polio outbreak of Asia, Africa and the Middle East in May. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity, said: Ebola continues to pose a very serious health threat for people in West Africa, but it remains very unlikely that the outbreak will turn into a global pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, even though the epidemic is currently &quot;regional&quot;, Ebola is still of global concern and there remains a possibility that imported cases will reach countries outside of West Africa and also that the health care system, economies and stability of the countries involved will be affected.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said the announcement will make the vast resources of the UN such as funds, experts and equipment, available to help stop Ebola. This should bring the outbreak under control, although it's likely it won't be stopped completely until after Christmas.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement comes as a Spanish priest infected with the virus - the first European to be struck down by the disease - who was airlifted back to his home country was last night described as stable' in a Madrid hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, British Airways announced this week it had cancelled all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone to protect staff and passengers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY JONATHON HOPKINS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS the gloom deepened around global stock markets due to worries over conflicts in Iraq, Ukraine and Gaza, there were still a few bright spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana Diamonds shone through after the explorer confirmed it will kick off a drilling programme in the African country in the third week of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said work on the PL117 block in Orapa, Botswana will begin on targets identified through recent work by Sunland Minerals, its joint venture with Russian firm Alrosa-Nyurba - the largest diamond producer in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verification drilling depth will be 100 metres, and after the core is studied in Botswana, the specimens and samples from the site will be dispatched to St Petersburg, Russia for analysis, the firm said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also said an extensive work programme is being finalised for new licences in the area, and an enlarged team from Alrosa is due to join the existing Botswana Diamonds team at the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, one of Africa's most stable countries, is the world's largest producer of diamonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country started selling its own diamonds in December 2013 after the De Beers cartel agreed to a 10-year marketing agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That deal ended a more than one hundred year tradition of sending diamonds mined in Africa to London where they were valued, sorted and sold at pre-determined prices. Around &pound;4bn of diamond trades are estimated to take place in Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana Diamonds gained nearly 16pc, or 0.38p to 2.75p, on the prospect of getting a share of those riches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the overall market mood was far from sparkling as US President Barack Obama's plans for air strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq notched up the geopolitical uncertainty for stocks already impacted by conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Footsie closed off its worst levels as a recent sell-off in US stocks steadied in early trade on Wall Street, but the FTSE 100 index still ended 30.01 points lower at 6567.36. The UK index dropped over 3pc in the past seven sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail was one of the minority of blue chip gainers after it announced plans for further efficiency savings by asking delivery staff to collect mail from up to 50,000 post boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail shares, which have fallen to their lowest levels since the firm's controversial privatisation last October, gained nearly 3pc or 12.5p to 426.5p. Bermuda-based insurer Catlin Group was the top mid cap performer, up nearly 4.5pc or 20.7p to 507p after it reported a 118pc jump in first half pre-tax profits, but the FTSE 250 index was weaker early on with the market malaise, but recovered to close up 3.28 points at 15,243.38.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henderson Group was under pressure, shedding 5.4p to 222.6p as broker Credit Suisse downgraded its rating for the fund manager's stock to neutral from outperform following recent first half results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the geopolitical conflicts, worry over the spread of the Ebola virus was also spooking investors as the World Health Organisation declared that the outbreak in West Africa is an international health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Westminster Group got a boost, adding 7.25p at 48.25p after it said it has deployed advanced fever detection screening equipment, which identifies people who may be suffering from ebola and other viruses to its airport security operations in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the upside with small caps, outdoor audio visual advertising specialist MediaZest jumped nearly 9pc, or 0.01p to 0.16p as it said it has won a batch of new contracts and said it expects to announce further new business wins before the close of the half year. The group said the new service contract revenues it has won will contribute in total more than &pound;85,000 to the current half year, which ends on September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contract news was also a boost for SeaEnergy, shares in which jumped 7.5pc or 2.25p to 32.25p after its GOSeaEnergy Ship Management joint venture won two further ship management contracts deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And shares in Rose Petroleum added 0.2p to 3.35p after it promoted John Blair to be chief executive of its US oil and gas assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the downside, small cap hygiene group Puricore shares dropped 7.5pc, or 2.75p to 33.5p, as it reported an increased first half operating loss as revenues slid 31pc as the company continued to revamp its offering to supermarket retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puricore shares dropped last month after it warned that it was set to post a loss due to lower sales of its new its supermarket retail concentrate products.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak in west Africa was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) yesterday as the number of dead neared 1,000 and authorities expressed fears that the virus could spread worldwide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general, appealed for global help to combat what she said was &quot;the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak in the nearly four-decade history of this disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coordinated response was essential to stop the international spread of the disease, the organisation said after a two-day emergency meeting. &quot;The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it,&quot; Dr Chan said, noting that the countries affected - Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria - could not cope with the virus on their own. &quot;I am declaring the current outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO warning came after US health authorities admitted that Ebola could spread beyond West Africa and possibly to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are all connected and inevitably there will be travellers ... here with symptoms,&quot; Tom Frieden, the head of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told a congressional committee. A spokesman later stressed that those with suspect symptoms might not necessarily have Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids, causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable haemorrhaging. There is no known cure, although scientists have called for an experimental drug, ZMapp, being used on two infected American aid workers to be made available for African victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The toll from the outbreak has now risen to 961, with more than 1,700 confirmed cases. Nigeria has been the least affected, with two deaths and seven confirmed cases in Lagos, but the city's status as a regional hub for international travel makes a wider outbreak there a major concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin, to the west of Nigeria, was awaiting test results from two patients with Ebola-like symptoms. In Uganda, a suspected Ebola patient tested negative - but the case fuelled fears that the virus could spread to east Africa. States of emergency have been declared in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, with soldiers guarding clinics and sealing off roads to the worst hit areas - a measure the WHO said was a necessary first step towards containing the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Europe, Greece reported yesterday that a male citizen who had recently travelled to Nigeria was being tested for Ebola at an Athens hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first confirmed Ebola patient to be treated in Europe - an elderly Spanish priest who was airlifted to a Madrid hospital after becoming infected during aid work in Liberia - was said by officials to be &quot;weakened and feverish&quot; but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Commission insisted that the risk to the continent from the virus was &quot;extremely low&quot;, in part due to high standards of health care and prevention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will genetic modification become popular by beating the Ebola plague? The experimental drug, ZMapp, which so far seems to be helping two infected Americans, is made from modified antibodies that - just to complete the green demonology - have been grown in tobacco leaves by a company with ties to the US defence department. But if the drug succeeds, and can be manufactured fast enough, there will surely be few complaints about how it was created.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are already virtually none about GM insulin, which has benefited millions of diabetics. And an Oxford company is trialling an attempt to beat dengue fever, by releasing male GM mosquitoes, which will breed with wild females but fail to produce viable offspring: if it works, it may receive similar applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GM crops were rejected here largely because they posed risks, but only really benefited the companies that made them. Now, as The Daily Telegraph reported this week, a trial crop rich in Omega 3 is about to be harvested. This is not straightforward: such &quot;nutraceuticals&quot; could pose hazards to some people. But it, like all GM, should be debated sensibly, without returning to the old slanging match between those who back or reject the technology unquestioningly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF EVER there was a likely spot for an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, New Kru Town in Liberia is it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A sprawling slum of the country's warravaged capital, Monrovia, it is home to 50,000 people and has next to no functioning lavatories, sinks or bathrooms. Sewage runs openly through its maze of corrugated shacks, and in Liberia's wet season - at its height now - tropical torrents turn it into one vast, warm, moist breeding pool for germs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It hardly feels surprising then, in the wake of several locals dying from Ebola, to see health teams daubing blue crosses on a number of shacks around town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crosses are not to identify those who have caught the disease, but to mark the relatively few New Kru Towners who have been visited by the teams and accepted their advice on how to avoid getting it. So far, only around 500 houses have been marked - and with health workers themselves accused of spreading the disease, some parts of New Kru Town remain decidedly hostile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a very poor neighbourhood where sanitation is lacking and people are not well educated in the principles of hygiene,&quot; said Tamba Bundor, the leader of a team of volunteers from the local health charity Community Development Services, a Unicef partner, as he drove his car through wet, sandy back lanes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is where the first victims of Ebola died in Monrovia, and most people who have been affected became so because they did not adhere to the messages of prevention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 1,000 people have now died of the disease across west Africa. While the outbreak started in remote forested inland areas - possibly via fruit bats - New Kru Town is an example of the ease and unpredictability with which it has spread to urban capitals along the coastline, catching health officials off-guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When some initial cases first appeared in Liberia's northern Lofa County in March, health officials initially thought they had it under control. But in June, a resident of a district of New Kru Town known as Carpet Street died, as did several others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dr Bernice Dahn, Liberia's chief medical officer, three of the victims died while being sheltered in a local church - a sign of how some people believe the disease is a curse that can be cured by prayer or witchcraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must stop keeping people suspected of Ebola in our churches on the grounds that we can heal them,&quot; she warned at the time. &quot;The churches are not hospitals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberian hospitals, however, do not always inspire the kind of faith that people have in Liberian churches. A fortnight ago, one of the main local health facilities, Redemption Hospital, was stoned by a mob after a woman died in there from suspected Ebola, following nationwide rumours that health workers were passing on the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, the squat, single-storey building offers redemption no more, having been shut down temporarily, its staff afraid for their own safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Safety is a concern too for Mr Bundor and his colleagues, who were attacked as they tried to visit the house of the bereaved family on Carpet Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The victim's relations were insisting that their loved one had died as a result of a family curse - a cause of death that, in New Kru Town anyway, carries less social stigma than dying of an infectious disease. &quot;The family of the victim were angry, saying it was a curse, not Ebola,&quot; said Anthony Worpor, another of Mr Bundor's health team, who was clad in a T-shirt that said &quot;Save lives, wash your hands before you eat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A crowd gathered, and some accused us health workers of spreading the disease. They even began touching a local journalist we had brought with us, saying, 'If you think it is us spreading it, then here you are, we will infect you'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Kru Town was originally named after the Kru, a powerful ethnic group. They were traditionally known for a certain independence of mind, and European slave traders used to complain that they were particularly resistant to capture, to the point where their price as slaves was considerably lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They proved equally hostile to the freed American slaves who founded Liberia in the 19th century, when the latter tried to muscle in on their trading empires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, New Kru Town is home to a wider ethnic mix, but even so, suspicion of outside influences persists. While Mr Bundor's education programme has already enjoyed some success, he estimates that 40 per cent of New Kru Town's residents are still &quot;in denial&quot; about Ebola's risks and the necessary health measures to avoid it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, some residents seem to treat Mr Bundor rather like a Christian doorto-door preacher, listening politely to his warnings but not heeding them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, at Alan's Bar, a dinghy shebeen, a poster warning of the dangers of Ebola was fixed to the front door. Yet official health advice is to avoid bars and other public gathering places altogether now, a message that the groups of drinkers inside, listening to blaring African disco music, have chosen to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The owner of the bar, Alan Tokba, told The Daily Telegraph that &quot;no dancing was allowed&quot; inside, and that visitors were being asked to wash their hands as they went in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Bundor admitted that it was &quot;not satisfactory&quot;. Nor was he entirely happy with the efforts of Tina Teeh, 26, a mother of three. Her house already bore the blue cross of one of New Kru Town's hygiene converts, but the bucket of chlorinated water she had for her children to wash their hands did not have a separate container to drip the fluid on to their hands first. &quot;I can't afford it,&quot; she told the disapproving Mr Bundor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But what if you end up ill?&quot; he asked her. &quot;Then you will have to afford hospital fees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another mother who claimed to have seen the light was Julie Life, 30, who admitted having been sceptical that Ebola even existed when Mr Bundor first visited her home a few days ago. She said her main reason for changing her mind was watching a deadly virus at work in the Tom Cruise film Mission Impossible II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Mr Bundor and his colleagues trudged off to root out New Kru Town's remaining Ebola &quot;deniers&quot;, it seemed an apt description of their task.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak in west Africa was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) yesterday as the number of dead neared 1,000 and authorities expressed fears that the virus could spread worldwide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general, appealed for global help to combat what she said was &quot;the largest, most severe and most complex outbreak in the nearly fourdecade history of this disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coordinated response was essential to stop the international spread of the disease, the organisation said after a two-day emergency meeting. &quot;The outbreak is moving faster than we can control it,&quot; Dr Chan said, noting that the countries affected - Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria - could not cope with the virus on their own. &quot;I am declaring the current outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO warning came after US health authorities admitted that Ebola could spread beyond West Africa and possibly to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are all connected and inevitably there will be travellers ... here with symptoms,&quot; Tom Frieden, the head of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told a congressional committee. A spokesman later stressed that those with suspect symptoms might not necessarily have Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids, causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable haemorrhaging. There is no known cure, although scientists have called for an experimental drug, ZMapp, being used on two infected American aid workers to be made available for African victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The toll from the outbreak has now risen to 961, with more than 1,700 confirmed cases. Nigeria has been the least affected, with two deaths and seven confirmed cases in Lagos, but the city's status as a regional hub for international travel makes a wider outbreak there a major concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin, to the west of Nigeria, was awaiting test results from two patients with Ebola-like symptoms. In Uganda, a suspected Ebola patient tested negative - but the case fuelled fears that the virus could spread to east Africa. States of emergency have been declared in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, with soldiers guarding clinics and sealing off roads to the worst hit areas - a measure the WHO said was a necessary first step towards containing the outbreak. In Europe, Greece reported yesterday that a male citizen who had recently travelled to Nigeria was being tested for Ebola at an Athens hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first confirmed Ebola patient to be treated in Europe - an elderly Spanish priest who was airlifted to a Madrid hospital after becoming infected during aid work in Liberia - was said by officials to be &quot;weakened and feverish&quot; but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Commission insisted that the risk to the continent from the virus was &quot;extremely low&quot;, in part due to high standards of health care and prevention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has declared the Ebola outbreak in west Africa an international public health emergency, but it is not recommending general bans on travel or trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 1,711 confirmed and suspected cases, and 961 deaths, the WHO said the outbreak was a public health risk to other states - particularly in view of &quot;fragile healthcare systems&quot; in the affected countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own,&quot; said Margaret Chan, the WHO's director general. &quot;I urge the international community to provide this support on the most urgent basis possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current outbreak began in Guinea in March and has spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, with some cases in Nigeria. There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola and the death rate has been about 50%. The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning symptoms do not necessarily show before then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO emergency committee agreed, after meetings in Geneva and teleconferences with representatives in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, that the outbreak met all the conditions for a public health emergency, Chan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the WHO said &quot;there should be no general ban on international travel or trade&quot;, it issued a long list of recommendations on travel and contacts, including urging that all travellers leaving the countries affected by the outbreak should be screened for fever, and no corpses should be transported across borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said other states should provide information to people travelling to affected and at-risk areas, be prepared to detect, investigate and manage Ebola cases, and be prepared for the evacuation and repatriation of nationals, including health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States should also ensure access to specialist diagnostic laboratories, and prepare to manage travellers who arrive at international airports or border crossings with &quot;unexplained febrile illness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries,&quot; a statement said. &quot;A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's president Goodluck Jonathan has declared a national state of emergency, and approved 1.9bn naira (&pound;6.9m) in emergency funds to help fight the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity Save the Children said medical services in the affected countries were overwhelmed. Rob MacGillivray, regional humanitarian director, said even before the outbreak there were 33,000 people in Sierra Leone and Liberia to every doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO described the risk of business travellers or tourists returning from affected areas with the virus as &quot;extremely low&quot;. &quot;Transmission requires direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected living or dead persons or animals, all unlikely exposures for the average traveller.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tolbert Nyenswah, the deputy chief medical officer and assistant health minister, said the outbreak had forced a number of hospitals and clinics to close because staff were scared to work in them. He disclosed that some 67 health workers had become infected, and that many of the 6,000-strong work force were reluctant to return to their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spoke to The Daily Telegraph in Liberia's seafront capital, Monrovia, from where the government is mounting a desperate fight to stop the disease spreading.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday night, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared a state of emergency across the country, and also despatched troops in full combat gear to block people travelling to Liberia's capital from rural areas hit by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some parts of the country - devastated by civil war during the Nineties - locals had been dumping bodies of family members on the streets rather than taking them to hospitals or morgues, said Liberia's information minister, Lewis Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health facilities are sometimes feared to be sources of the virus, while many are scared that if they identify a body as being that of a relation, they will be ostracised in their communities or forced to go into quarantine in government clinics. Such fears increase the risk of people incubating the virus without the authorities detecting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Separately, the first European victim of the Ebola outbreak arrived in Spain yesterday and was taken to a Madrid hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miguel Pajares, 75, was helping to treat Ebola patients at a Roman Catholic mission in Liberia when he tested positive for the virus earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was flown to Spain along with a colleague, Juliana Bohi, a nun from Equatorial Guinea with Spanish nationality. The priest's condition was said to be stable with no signs of bleeding, while the Sister Juliana appeared to be well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Liberia, Mr Nyenswah said that the authorities were gradually getting the message across that Ebola was a threat, ending widespread myths such as that it was the work of witchcraft, could be cured by prayer, or was simply a ruse by the government to frighten people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he warned that with 95 per cent of the country's health infrastructure having been destroyed during the civil war of the Nineties, it was still &quot;simply too weak&quot; to cope with major challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need support from the outside for an outbreak like this,&quot; he said. &quot;Ebola is a global public health problem that is crossing international borders and it is too much for poor health systems like ours that are devastated by conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Liberian health workers were scared to return to work, he said, because the early symptoms of Ebola were very similar to other illnesses, such as malaria and influenza, with which patients might turn up to clinics. As as result, they were wrongly demanding to be issued with full protective overalls and masks, when these were in fact only necessary - and practical - for staff working with full-blown Ebola patients in isolation wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the health workers are panicking and so it is difficult to get them back to work, and besides, we wouldn't want to give every clinic full protective clothing, even if we had the resources to,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola has claimed at least 932 lives and infected more than 1,700 people since breaking out in West Africa earlier this year, according to the World Health Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sierra Leone and Liberia are worst affected but there have also been cases in Nigeria and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sierra Leone, military forces also deployed yesterday as part of &quot;Operation Octopus&quot;, which officials said was aimed at preventing &quot;the unauthorised movement of Ebola-infected persons&quot;. Two towns in the east of the country, Kailahun and Kenema, were put in quarantine, a government spokesman said, as nightclubs and entertainment venues across the country were ordered shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> West Africans battling to contain the spread of the virus would have to wait for months until a potentially life-saving experimental drug used on two Americans infected with the disease could even be made, officials said. There is little of the experimental drug ZMapp available now, and even if it could be made in large quantities, its safety and effectiveness have yet to be tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in Nigeria say they have asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about access to the drug, but a CDC spokesman said &quot;there are virtually no doses available&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain announced yesterday that it would give a further &pound;3 million in aid to shore up Sierra Leone's beleaguered health system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday, health workers turned up in Monrovia's Clara Town district to remove two bodies of possible victims, four days after they dropped dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nema Red, a resident of Clara Town, said the two men had shown symptoms of Ebola such as bleeding and vomiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They started seeking help from the community to take them to the hospital, but community members ran for their lives... they both gave up and dropped dead on the ground in the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West African patients infected with the Ebola virus will not have access to experimental drugs being used to treat American cases of the disease for several months, if at all, Nigerian health authorities said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu told a press conference he had asked the US health authorities about the unproven medicines used on two American doctors, but was told such small quantities existed that west Africa would have to wait for months for supplies, even if they were proved safe and effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kent Brantly and Dr Nancy Writebol of the evangelical Christian organisation Samantha's Purse contracted the virus while helping to treat victims in Liberia. They were given the drug ZMapp after being evacuated to the US, and appear to be recovering.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the US Centres for Disease Control said &quot;there are virtually no doses available&quot; and they would take several months to manufacture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if supplies do become available, medical ethicists are divided over whether they should be used in the current Ebola outbreak in west Africa. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called a meeting of experts next week to help it guide doctors and drug companies who may consider shipping experimental drugs to the four countries hit by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak. We have a disease with a high fatality rate, without any proven treatment or vaccine,&quot; said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director general at the WHO. &quot;We need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said there were many questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Giving unlicensed and untested (at least in humans) treatments and vaccines is a very thorny ethical issue,&quot; he said. &quot;The infected US healthcare workers are receiving a type of treatment (antibodies that specifically target the virus) that has a reasonably long safety track record, so it isn't surprising - given the high fatality rate in the current outbreak - that they are happy to receive the therapy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But not all drugs are safe - that's why we have very stringent clinical trials. One could argue that the current outbreak provides a perfect arena in which to test new drugs, but that isn't without risk. We don't know their safety, we don't know if they are likely to work - sure, they have been tested in animals, but these studies don't always tell us what will happen in humans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, said most doctors in a situation like that of west Africa would want to try a drug that might work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my view, the ethical case is unequivocal. If a patient is likely to die and an experimental therapy has a reasonable chance to prevent death, then it should be given. However, this does not mean that any old drug could be given. For an experimental compound to be given, there should be good prior evidence that the therapy will work, the patient or his relatives should give informed consent wherever possible and whenever the therapy is given proper records must be kept and the outcome reported to WHO,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef, meanwhile, warned that children who had been orphaned by Ebola were finding themselves shunned by their communities. &quot;Children who are orphaned by the disease are finding it hard to be accepted in their communities and this has had huge psychological impacts on their lives,&quot; said the Unicef representative in Sierra Leone, Roeland Monasch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ebola outbreak has led to widespread misconceptions and myths and these are posing serious challenges in the fight to eradicate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with the orders of the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia, the Liberian Army has launched what it calls Operation White Shield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under this operation, According to Defense Minister, Brownie J. Samukai, the military will establish man checkpoints beginning in Lofa, Bong, Bomi and Cape Mount and will extend into and beyond as required to quarantine affected areas and restrict movements, as well as improve identification, tracing and maintaining medical observation and surveillance of suspected individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the regular press briefing of the Ministry of Information yesterday in Monrovia, Minister Samukai said these checkpoints are already being established and will include locations such as the St. Paul Bridge, Bo Waterside, Clay and Po River. White Shield will become fully operational by Friday (today).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military has warned that unless it is absolutely necessary, individuals in unaffected counties are strongly advised to remain in their counties, and to continue to take the necessary preventive measures announced by the health experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samukai said the Army has established several Task Forces to stop the movements of individuals with affected counties and communities and to allow health workers smoothly carry out their responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the first Task Force is based in Montserrado and extends to Margibi County; the second is based in Foya, Lofa County to monitor and treat affected individuals along the borders of Liberia in that northern county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the same Task Force is also in Voinjama City and Gbakedu, a bordering town that has been quarantined as one of the most affected towns in Lofa County. The Task Force is also based at the St. Paul Bridge that borders Bong and Lofa Counties. The third Task Force, the Defense Minister said is based in Bomi, while the fourth is based in Grand Cape Mount County two western counties that are said to be highly infested with the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the military is presently based at the Clay Junction in Bomi and Sinje, Grand Cape Mount County. The Task Force is expected to stop the movements of individuals from leaving or going to those affected counties. He stated further that the move is intended to contain the Ebola virus and stop further spread of Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Samukai said the AFL is prepared to respond robustly to the President's mandate by erecting checkpoints at strategic locations in the country to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the military that has been ordered into action has warned politicians in the country not to interfere in its 90 days operation. Samukai said any politician who interferes with the operation of the army will face the full weight of the soldiers as they will deal with the situation severely without discrimination. He said the army will apply the Rule of Engagement in executing Operation White Shield if needed to ensure that the fight against the Ebola virus is seriously contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier yesterday before the Defense Ministry Press Conference, there were reports of the security forces restricting the movement of People at the Klay Checkpoint in Bomi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the INQUIRER visited the checkpoint yesterday hundreds of traders and commuters were seen stranded while soldiers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), officers of he Liberia National Police (LNP) and Immigration officers were on duty manning the checkpoint to ensure that no one crosses on either side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man identified as John Varney said since 4 p.m. on Wednesday they have been stranded at the checkpoint based on a stop order by the security forces. &quot;We slept at this Checkpoint. I work in Grand Cape Mount but my 18- year old son drowned so I am going back to Monrovia for his burial but here I am; my family is calling me and I cannot go,&quot; he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Police Commissioner Daniel B. Gotojuwee said the checkpoint has been closed based on the order from the Chief Executive as she declared the State of Emergency to stop the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sarah Coleman, a market woman, told the INQUIRER that she went to that part of the country to buy fish which she usually brings to Monrovia for sale and since Wednesday she could not reach her family in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The INQUIRER was informed that no company or private vehicle is allowed to cross on either side of the checkpoint but preference is being given to vehicles belonging to the United Nations system and other Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We came on this side to hustle for our living because we work with a Logging Company here but since Wednesday we cannot cross to go back to Monrovia where we live. Please tell Ellen that we want to go and be with our family,&quot; a spokesman for a group of young workers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On both sides of the checkpoint, vehicles with goods, marketers and other residents were seen a stranded mood that has not happened for a long time since the end of the Liberian Civil War.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security Expert Guard Agency of Liberia (SEGAL) has joined the fight against ebola virus, a deadliest disease that has killed hundreds of Liberians since February of this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease firstly broke out in Lofa County, northern Liberia and subsided for a short period of time, but resurfaced with heavy weight claiming the lives of Liberians and spreading in several other counties. The outbreak of the disease has drawn the attention of the international community urging the government to declare a state of national emergency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several families have been plagued by the disease and some are left with devastating hearts as they witnessed their love ones passing away by the day as the result of the infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO/General Manager of SEGAL, Momo T. Cyrus told newsmen recently that it was essential for all well-meaning institutions, agencies and organizations existing in the country to join the fight against ebola virus and give either financial or moral support to the government in its fight against the deadliest infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, his organization, being a private security firm and an auxiliary of national security had always being concerned of providing security services not only private institutions but had worked and ensured that national security is strongly supported. &quot;This is why my institution has purchased and distributed hundreds of buckets mainly to guard-posts where officers from SEGAL are deplored across Liberia,&quot; Cyrus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however said SEGAL joined the fight against ebola virus and it was firstly concerned about the welfare of its officers. &quot;Besides, I am also concerned about my fellow citizens in different communities in the country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said, given the pandemic nature of the disease, SEGAL had in addition contributed a good number of several other buckets that are fashioned in unique ways to many communities across the country to regularly take water to keep washing their hands as part of the preventive measures prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Social welfare for Liberians to apply in the fight against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO/ General Manager of SEGAL told newsmen in an apparent worried stance, that his security firm has a plan to make cash donation towards the battle against the deadliest infection. &quot;My institution has a plan to make cash contribution towards the fight against the ebola virus,&quot; he told newsmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the outbreak of the infection is a national tragedy that all Liberians must not take with a pinch of salt but rather join the government in its fight aimed at eradicating it from the country. &quot;I am worried simply because our people are being killed by the disease,&quot; he told the newsmen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fight against the deadly Ebola virus intensifies, a charitable organization, the Lions' Club of Liberia has joined the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lions' Club of Liberia, a conglomeration of the fourLions' Clubs in the country including the Greater Monrovia Lions Club, Cape Mesurado Lions' Club, Ducor Lions' Club and the Buchanan Lions' Club on Wednesday distributed several detergents to vulnerable Liberians at various centers in Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lions' Club of Liberia distributed several items including faucetbuckets, cans of Clorox and chlorine, soap, gloves, delta and other preventive materials to the Old Folks Refuge Home, the School for the Blind and Deaf in Virginia, the Liberian Blind Association on the old LPRC Road in Gardnersville, the ELWA Hospital in Paynesville and the Christian Association of the Blind in Tinger'sVillage outside Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charitable organization's gesture is intended to help the visually impaired persons and other vulnerable groups prevent themselves against the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remarks during the distribution, Cape Mesurado Lions' Club President, DavidettaKotty said the gesture was the Lions' Club of Liberia's own way of identifying with the visually impaired and other less fortunate Liberians to fight the Ebola virus which has rapidly spread throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Kotty added that the virus poses serious threat to the survival of human lives in Liberia and other affected countries in the West African Basin. She said the virus can be contained if onlythose preventive measures released by the Ministry of Health are followed to the letter.The four Lion's Club said their efforts are to see Ebola eradicated from Liberia and to assist the blind who do not see who touch them in many cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of their various organizations and institutions, the recipients lauded the Liberian Lions' Clubs for the kind gesture and called on other well-meaning Liberians to emulate such good example exhibited by the clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson Suah, Principal of the School of the Blind said Lions' Club is the only organization in the country that has always identified with the visually impaired and other vulnerable Liberians. He said it was the Cape Mesurado Lions' Club that constructed a water tower for the blind at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suah assured the organization that the preventive materials will be used by them (Blind) to protect themselves against the deadly Ebola virus. Also, the Medical Director at the ELWA Hospital, Dr. Brown lauded Lions' Club for the donation of the items and said the materials will be used by health workers to carry on their duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">518 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON WEDNESDAY, THE Government of Liberia through President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf declared a state of emergency for 90 days as a means of containing the raging Ebola virus which has spread to eight of Liberia's fifteen counties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN A NATIONWIDE address, the President said her action was in consonance with Article 86(a)(b) of the Constitution of Liberia. She said under the state of emergency, the government will institute extraordinary measures; including if need be the suspensions of certain rights and privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT SIRLEAF SAID though government has taken action to curtail the virus, the threat continues to grow. She stated that ignorance, poverty as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices continue to exacerbate the spread of the disease especially in the counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHE SAID THE actions allowed by statues under the Public Health Law are no longer adequate to deal with the Ebola epidemic as comprehensive and holistic as the outbreak requires. Also in recent times, government has taken several measures to ensure that the virus is contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OVER LAST WEEKEND, several public and private buildings were disinfected with detergents and others to avoid further spread of the virus. Despite these measures, the virus continues to rage on, killing hundreds of our citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS SITUATION HAS indeed reached a precarious stage to the point that the government has gone ahead to declare a state of emergency, quarantined several counties and restricted the movement of the citizens for 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW THAT THE military has come out to join the fight against the Ebola epidemic, let us as Liberians, and seeing the death tolls caused by the Ebola virus, cooperate with the actions announced by the government and abide by those rules by state authorities and cooperate with the military task force established by the Defense Ministry in the various counties to fight against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REMAIN WHEREVER YOU find yourself as stated by the Minister of National Defense, Brownie Samukai and stop challenging government's authorities because this is about lives, our own lives. We are dying in mass and the only way this virus can be contained is to abide by these measures and cooperate with the state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ARE PLEADING to all Liberians as well as foreign nationals within the territorial limits of our country to cooperate with the government because we have seen the effect being caused by this deadly virus. While we understand the embarrassments and inconveniences caused by the state of emergency in terms of movements, let us for the sake of avoiding further spread of the Ebola virus, accept the 21 days non-movement action and remain wherever we are presently to save our own lives and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, WE ARE appealing to all Liberians to cooperate with the rules under the state of emergency and remain wherever we are. Stopping the movements of people from place to place will help in the eradication of Ebola in Liberia and our lives will be saved. Remember, Ebola is real; it is killing too much of our people therefore, let us work with the government in containing the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is just one of many Ebola victims to have been dragged out of their homes and dumped on the country's roads by terrified relatives in a desperate bid to avoid being quarantined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of the deadly virus began in March, and has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 people across West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the Liberian government announced tough measures to contain the disease, including shutting schools, imposing quarantines on victims' homes and tracking their friends and relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday information minister Lewis Brown said locals had started dragging bodies onto the streets, as many fear that being isolated in a home where an Ebola victim has died will put them at risk of catching the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are removing the bodies from their homes and are putting them out in the street,' Mr Brown said, adding: We're asking people to please leave the bodies in their homes and we'll pick them up.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown also confirmed that on Monday night, troops were deployed in the border region of Lofa to isolate affected communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: We hope it will not require excessive force, but we have to do whatever we can to restrict the movement of people out of affected areas.' On Monday the Liberian government announced that corpses will now have to be cremated, as attempts to check the spread of Ebola have been hampered by the tradition of touching bodies at burials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Development Bank and World Bank is to give $260million to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea amid fears that the disease will overrun healthcare systems in one of the world's poorest regions. But Samura Kamara, Sierra Leone's foreign minister, said the virus had cost the government $10million and was hampering efforts to stimulate growth. British Airways is suspending flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany has also joined France and the US in advising against travel to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile two infected American aid workers have seen their conditions improve thanks to an experimental drug developed by a US biotech firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a man in Saudi Arabia is undergoing tests for a suspected Ebola infection after returning from a trip to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPAIN was last night preparing to accept Europe's first confirmed case of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A medically equipped military jet was sent to Liberia yesterday to repatriate Miguel Pajares, 75, a missionary priest working at a hospital in the west African country. He was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brother Pajares and his two fellow workers, Chantal Pascaline Mutwamene of Congo and Paciencia Melgar from Equatorial Guinea, belong to the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, a Catholic humanitarian group that runs hospitals around the world, and had been helping to treat patients infected with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The priest, who has spent five decades as a missionary in Liberia, was due to arrive back in Madrid early this morning and would be immediately transferred to the capital's Carlos III hospital, where an isolation ward had been set up. He will be treated by only two medical professionals in an attempt to contain the risk of the virus spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On hearing that he would be repatriated, he told Spain's ABC newspaper by telephone that &quot;this news has lifted my spirits, it is great. I am very happy. It is worth fighting on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number killed by the Ebola outbreak rose to 932 yesterday in four west African countries - Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria - according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The number of suspected, probable or confirmed cases rose to a total of 1,711 since the start of the outbreak earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Saudi Arabia, officials confirmed that a man who was being tested for the virus has died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 40-year-old was sent to hospital after showing symptoms after returning from Sierra Leone on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no proven vaccine or treatment but WHO said it would convene a meeting of medical ethics experts next week to consider making experimental treatments more widely available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has died of the virus in Lagos as five new cases of the lethal disease were confirmed in Africa's most populous country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse had helped to care for Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who last month visited from Liberia, one of three countries in the region hit by the world's biggest epidemic yet. The five new cases are believed to be other health workers who came into contact with Sawyer, who died within days of his arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll from the Ebola outbreak has now risen to 932 after another 45 patients died between 2 and 4 August, the World Health Organisation said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, Liberia's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced that the country was now in an official state of emergency, saying the outbreak presents a &quot;danger to the public&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters in the capital, Abuja: &quot;(On Tuesday) the first known Nigerian to die of Ebola was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other five (newly confirmed) cases are being treated at an isolation ward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials initially played down the risk of exposure, saying Sawyer had been isolated when he collapsed on arrival at Lagos airport two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday the state health commissioner, Jide Idris, said Ebola was diagnosed only after Sawyer had been taken to hospital and had come into contact with at least 70 others. They include airline passengers, airport officials and health workers, and have all been placed under surveillance. Seven have been quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told reporters they were compiling a list of secondary contacts, and appealed to those who believed they may be at risk to come forward.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has died of the virus in Lagos as five new cases of the lethal disease were confirmed in Africa's most populous country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse had helped to care for Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who last month visited from Liberia, one of three countries in the region hit by the world's biggest epidemic yet. The five new cases are believed to be other health workers who came into contact with Sawyer, who died within days of his arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death toll from the Ebola outbreak has now risen to 932 after another 45 patients died between 2 and 4 August, the World Health Organisation said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters in the capital, Abuja: &quot;(On Tuesday) the first known Nigerian to die of Ebola was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other five (newly confirmed) cases are being treated at an isolation ward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials initially played down the risk of exposure, saying Sawyer had been isolated when he collapsed on arrival at Lagos airport two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday the state health commissioner, Jide Idris, said Ebola was diagnosed only after Sawyer had been taken to hospital and had come into contact with at least 70 others. They include airline passengers, airport officials and health workers, and have all been placed under surveillance. Seven have been quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told reporters they were compiling a list of secondary contacts, and appealed to those who believed they may be at risk to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days. Once transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of infected persons, or through infected meat or surfaces, a fever degenerates into bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea, which all contain vast amounts of the pathogen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrival of Miguel Pajares in Madrid met with concerns about Spain's ability to guarantee the virus would be contained</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Spanish missionary who contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia is in stable condition after arriving in Madrid on Thursday, health officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miguel Pajares, 75, arrived shortly after 8am local time (0700 BST) on a specially-equipped Airbus plane. He is the first Ebola patient of the current outbreak to be brought to Europe for treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital had been emptied of patients in preparation for Pajares' arrival, health union officials said. The 30 or so patients in the hospital were either sent home or to another hospital in the city. Pajares arrived with Juliana Bohi, a nun born in Equatorial Guinea and who holds Spanish nationality. Bohi is not thought to be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a medical examination on the tarmac at the Torrej&oacute;n air base, the pair were taken to Madrid's Carlos III hospital in ambulances equipped as biological isolation units. Police cars and motorcycles escorted the vehicles, and a helicopter monitored the situation from above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bohi was admitted to the same hospital as a preventative measure, health officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial examinations showed Pajares to be in stable condition, according to Rafael P&eacute;rez-Santamarina, the director of Madrid's La Paz hospital. The city's regional government health chief, Francisco Javier Rodr&iacute;guez, said Pajares was not bleeding and seemed not to be at an advanced stage of the illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajares was one of three missionaries to test positive for the virus at the San Jos&eacute; de Monrovia hospital in Liberia. The three were part of a larger group which had been helping to treat people infected with Ebola as part of their work with the San Juan de Dios order, a Catholic humanitarian organisation that runs hospitals around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of his repatriation was met with controversy in Spain, and health professionals were concerned that Spanish hospitals were not properly equipped to handle the virus. Amyts, a trade union that represents physicians, called the repatriation risky. The union's president, Daniel Bernab&eacute;u, told the Spanish news agency Efe that the decision was &quot;political rather than health-related&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asking if &quot;anyone could guarantee 100% that the virus wouldn't escape,&quot; he said that Spain could have instead sent help to the priest in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said theUS, which has repatriated two of its own nationals to date, had 10 hospitals with the highest level of biosafety possible. Spain, in contrast, has just one adequate hospital with biosafety levels that were much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official from the Spain's health ministry downplayed the potential public health risk at a news conference on Wednesday. The public health director general, Mercedes Vinuesa, assured Spaniards that the protocols in place for the evacuation would &quot;guarantee minimum risk&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President claims Ebola can be controlled and contained with the right resources, despite claiming 900 lives in west Africa</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama has said a global effort is required to combat the spread of Ebola which he blamed on weak and overwhelmed health systems in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the end of a summit of African leaders in Washington, the president said the disease - which has claimed the lives of more than 900 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - can be controlled and contained with the right resources. A single case has also been confirmed in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ebola virus both currently and in the past is controlled if you have a strong public health infrastructure in place and countries that have been affected are first to admit that what's happened here is their public health systems have been overwhelmed. They weren't able to identify and then isolate cases quickly enough,&quot; he said. &quot;You did not have a strong trust relationship between some of the communities that were affected and health workers. As a consequence it spread more rapidly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the US is working with European countries and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to respond to the crisis. The US centres for disease control moved Ebola to its highest category of health threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's get all the health workers we need on the ground. Let's help to bolster the systems that there are in place. Let's nip as early as possible any additional outbreaks of the disease,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president said it was too early to decide whether an experimental drug given to an American health worker who contracted Ebola and has been flown back to the US could be distributed in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the Ebola outbreak was discussed in his collective meetings with African leaders behind closed doors on the third and final day of the largest summit of the continent's governments held in Washington. He said that one consequence was a decision to establish an African centre for disease control. HIV/Aids was also on the agenda with a plan to double the number of children receiving life saving antiretroviral drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama described the summit as an &quot;extraordinary event&quot; which promoted trade and discussed issues ranging from combatting corruption to women's rights and freedom of the press. The president said there was common agreement on the need to deepen security cooperation against terrorism because of spreading violent instability in parts of the continent, from Boko Haram in Nigeria to the al-Shabab in Somalia which is destabilising neighbouring Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States doesn't have a desire to expand and create a big footprint inside of Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the president said Washington will back a &quot;new security governance initiative&quot; to strengthen security forces of African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're starting with Kenya, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But human rights groups say that anti-terrorism strategies and laws in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya are increasingly used in parts of Africa to suppress political activity and the press, and that American-backed security forces in Nigeria and Kenya are responsible for attacks on civilians and other abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama defended the relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many times we will work with countries even though they're not perfect on every issue. We find that in some cases engaging in a country that in general is a good partner but is not conforming optimally when it comes to all the various categories of human rights, we can be effective by working with them on certain areas and criticising them and trying to elicit improvements in other areas,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president acknowledged that the fight against armed groups is undermined when government forces assault the civilian population, such as accusations by human rights groups that the Nigerian military has massacred innocent people and destroyed property in its war with Boko Haram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the encouraging things in the sessions was a recognition that fighting terrorism also requires security forces that are professional, that are disciplined, that are themselves not engaging in human rights violations,&quot; he said. &quot;That part of the lesson we've all learned about terrorism is that it's possible in reaction to terrorism to actually accelerate the disease if the response is one that alienates populations or particular ethnic groups or particular religions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators from several African countries gathered not far from the State Department where the summit was meeting. Jacques Miango from the Democratic Republic of Congo accused Obama of abandoning a commitment to support &quot;strong institutions not strong men&quot; by inviting president Joseph Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now in Congo we have a strong man not strong institutions. We are here to see if Obama will keep his word,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US says that the secretary of state, John Kerry, met Kabila on Monday and told him that Washington expects him to abide by Congo's constitution and leave power after two terms as president in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protestors from Burkina Faso pressed home a similar message over president Blaise Compaor[#xfffd] who they accuse of attempting to change his country's constitution to extend his 27 year rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators from Ghana stood across the street demanding that Obama get President John Mahama to account for $30bn in loans in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No water, no electricity. Is this the better Ghana?&quot; said one sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several African leaders cancelled scheduled press conferences at the end of the summit, including South Sudan, Somalia and Tanzania. Others said they would only speak to the official press from their own nations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will be deploying a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to West Africa to coordinate the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola outbreak, which has so far sickened more than 1,600 people, including nearly 900 who have died from the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team will comprise staff from the Agency's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, who will be overseeing critical areas of the response, such as planning, operations, logistics in coordination with other federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will also serve on the DART to lead on public health and medical response activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID is also announcing an additional $5 million in assistance to help ramp up the international community's Ebola response efforts. Specifically, this funding will go toward the expansion of Ebola outbreak programs the Agency is already supporting in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These programs help trace people who may be infected with the disease, as well as provide health clinics and households with hygiene kits, soap, bleach, gloves, masks, and other supplies to help prevent the spread of disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID is also supporting outreach campaigns to provide information on Ebola and its symptoms to the general public and health workers in affected countries who may not be familiar with the disease. These messages are being conveyed through radio, text messages, and through local media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the new funding, USAID has provided $2.1 million to the UN World Health Organization and UNICEF for the deployment of more than 30 technical experts and other Ebola response efforts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SINCE THE SERIES of public announcements by the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Information, Culture Affairs and Tourism that no one is to touch or remove corpses of dead persons without contacting the Ministry of Health, it has been observed in recent times the discovery of many dead bodies in several communities without intervention from the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ADVICE FROM the Health Ministry has caused many families, friends and relatives to abandon the remains of their families, friends or love ones to avoid getting in contact with the deadly Ebola virus. But despite the advice by the Health Ministry, we continue to see or hear of the abandonment of dead bodies in several communities without been removed by authorities of the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS SITUATION CONTINUES to pose serious health hazard in many communities as some of the bodies remain on the streets or in houses for days. A particular case was in New Kru Town recently where bodies of some dead residents of the community could not be removed by the residents in accordance with the advice by the Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MANNER IN which Government is creating the awareness and communicating with the citizens in containing the Ebola virus has instilled serious fear in the minds of many Liberians and are afraid to touch the bodies of their family members thus causing the remains of a dead person to overstay in several communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT WE ARE hearing is that whenever a person dies whether he or she dies from the Ebola virus or not, people are afraid to remove their corpses. Sometimes the Ministry of Health can be contacted to remove the corpses without any response and as such the bodies remain in such community for several days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INSTEAD OF HELPING the situation, we believe that this is not in any way contributing positively contributing to the fight against the virus as bodies are left alone in houses or residential areas without being removed by the Ministry of Health or other health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS SERIOUSLY affecting our people despite what the Health Ministry says these measures are intended to fight the Ebola virus. We call on the Ministry of Health and Information Ministry to redefine their public announcement strategy and decide on new strategies to stop further spread of the virus. Some of the abandoned bodies may not be that of an Ebola patient but died from other diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE THINK THAT this method of communication creates fear in the minds of the people especially so when they have been advised against touching any body in their homes or communities. Even health workers are being considered as Ebola suspects something that has discouraged them from continuing their works at many health centers in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT IS BEING of major concern in recent times is that whenever the Ministry of Health's hotlines are called to report the presence of a patient or dead body in a particular community called, there can be no immediate response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THAT IS WHY government must redefine its communication strategy and act swiftly in responding to cases whether Ebola or ordinary cases to curtail the death toll in our country. Let there be serious sensitization on this deadly Ebola virus. Let the Health Ministry or other health authorities in the country respond to the hotlines because the situation is posing serious health hazard in many communities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of the Commission, ClIr. Jerome George Korkoya said the NEC may be unable to deploy staff in the field to conduct Civic/Voter Education as well as recruit and deploy 25,000 polling staff at polling centers in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Korkoya said the Commission's recommendation is also based on the fact that the Ebola outbreak would hinder the smooth conduct of campaign activities by candidates who are desirous of contesting the October 14, 2014 Special Senatorial Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the health emergency in Liberia may affect the conduct of free, fair, transparent and credible election on October 14, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC Chairman made the recommendation Wednesday at a meeting with political parties and individuals whose names were recently published on the provisional list of candidates for the Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission recommended that the election be postponed to the first week in December, 2014. In response, attendees of the meeting however noted that due to the constitutional nature of the Special Senatorial Election, the Commission should take the appropriate steps to ensure that such recommended postponement is done in line with the laws of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting which was attended by more than 90 persons representing political parties, and independent candidates, was the second in a series of meetings held with stakeholders in the electoral process in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday the Commission held similar meeting with representatives of civil society organizations involved with electoral activities operating under the banner of the Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Commission will meet with religious leaders in Liberia on Thursday, August 7, 2014 to discuss similar matter with them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soniwein Community 0603 District # 8 Central Monrovia has elected a new corps of officers to run the affairs of that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those elected include Mr. Abel Glaysuah of the Alliance Transformation of Soniwein as Chairman, Mr.Adolphus Abu Kaizolu, Secretary General and Mr. Moibeyan F. Konneh as Financial Secretary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are Madam Rita Mathies as Chairlady for the women's wing and also Mr. Rajue I. Foah as the youth leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this paper on Wednesday, August 5 2014, the Chairman elect, Mr. Abel Glaysuah, outlined several essential developmental facilities the community lacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst them he cited the deplorable condition of the town hall which he emphasized has no good toilet; poor sanitation condition as waste materials (feces) from bathrooms and toilets from AMEU on Camp Johnson Road continuously runs down into the community, a situation the newly elected Chair said is hazardous to the health of dwellers in that community. He however promised that as a leader his administration will work with all the institutions that are responsible in improving the sanitary conditions of various communities. He stressed on the deplorable condition of the school accommodated in the City Hall lack of safe drinking water, no arm-chairs and as such he is calling upon the Ministry of Education (MOE), UNICEF and other humanitarian organizations to come their aid by providing necessary materials for the institution. Mr. Glaysuah further appealed to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to assist the clinic there with drugs especially with the prevailing outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the country. He lamented that whenever the community members go to the clinic for disinfectants or buckets they will be told that the Montserrado County authorities have not given them any supply. Mr. Glaysuah disclosed one case of Ebola in the area but was quick to say that the victim was transferred to an isolated center and as such they need speedy assistance. Pertaining to the security situation in the community, the Chairman elect said Soniwein is one of the areas that harbor high rate of notorious criminals and the perpetual sale and usage of narcotic drugs are serious challenges residents are faced with. He therefore called on the Liberia National Police (LNP), the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Community Policing to work along with the vigilante groups so as to curtail the unwholesome activities in that community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Mr. Glaysuah urged the residents to work collaboratively with the new leadership as a team, in order to move the community forward.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf yesterday declared a state of emergency for 90 days, as government mounts efforts to curtail the spread of the deadly Ebola Virus which has claimed the lives of many Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nationwide address last night, President Sirleaf said her action was in consonance with Article 86(a)(b). She said under this State of Emergency, the Government will institute extraordinary measures, including, if need be, the suspensions of certain rights and privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As mandated by the Constitution, I will immediately forward this Declaration of the State of Emergency to the National Legislature, accompanied by an explanation of the facts and circumstances leading to the Declaration, she pointed out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberians leader noted that although the government had taken actions to curtail the disease, the threat continues to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went on:&quot;Ignorance, poverty, as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices continue to exacerbate the spread of the disease especially in the counties. The actions allowed by statues under the public health LAW are no longer adequate to deal with the Ebola epidemic in as comprehensive and holistic as the outbreak requires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said the virus currently has no cure and has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent and that the aggregate number of cases; confirmed, probable and suspected in Liberia has now exceeded 500 with about 271 cumulative deaths, with 32 deaths among health care workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the death rate among citizens, especially among health workers is alarming. She said it was based on this threat that it was necessary to declare this state of emergency throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATEMENT ON THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY BY PRESIDENT ELLEN JOHNSON SIRLEAF, R.L.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUGUST 6, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fellow Liberians, our nation is currently affected by the deadly Ebola Virus and the disease has now spread to eight counties. Liberia is among three countries experiencing an unprecedented outbreak of the virus, the larger ever since this virus was first discovered. It now poses serious risks to the health, safety, security and welfare of our nation. And beyond the public health risk, the disease is now undermining the economic stability of our country to the tone of millions of dollars in lost revenue, productivity and economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heath care system in the county is now under immense strain and the Ebola epidemic is having a chilling effect on the overall health care delivery. Out of fear of being infected with the disease, health care practitioners are afraid to accept new patients, especially in community clinics all across the country. Consequently, many common diseases which are especially prevalent during the rainy season, such as malaria, typhoid and common cold, are going untreated and may lead to unnecessary and preventable deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus currently has no cure and has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent. The aggregate number of cases; confirmed, probable and suspected in Liberia has now exceeded 500 with about 271 cumulative deaths. With 32 deaths among health care workers. The death rate among citizens, especially among health workers is alarming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, I established a National Task Force, which I chair myself, to respond to this crisis. I instructed all non-essential government staff to stay home for 30 days, ordered the closure of schools, and authorized the fumigation of all public buildings. We have shut down markets in affected areas and have restricted movement in others. We have improved our response time and contact tracking and have begun coordinating with regional and international partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these and other continuing efforts, the threat continues to grow. Ignorance, poverty, as well as entrenched religious and cultural practices continue to exacerbate the spread of the disease especially in the counties. The actions allowed by statues under the public health LAW are no longer adequate to deal with the Ebola epidemic in as comprehensive and holistic as the outbreak requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope and scale of the epidemic, the virulence and deadliness of the virus now exceed the capacity and statutory responsibility of any one government agency or ministry. The Ebola virus disease, the ramifications and consequences thereof, now constitute and unrest affecting the existence, security, and well-being of the Republic amounting to a clear and present danger. The Government and people of Liberia require extraordinary measures for the very survival of our state and for the protection of the lives of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, and by the virtue of the powers vested in me as President of the Republic of Liberia, I, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, and in keeping with Article 86(a) (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Liberia, hereby declare a State of Emergency throughout the Republic of Liberia effective as of August 6, 2014 for a period of 90 days. Under this State of Emergency, the Government will institute extraordinary measures, including, if need be, the suspensions of certain rights and privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As mandated by the Constitution, I will immediately forward this Declaration of the State of Emergency to the National Legislature, accompanied by an explanation of the facts and circumstances leading to the Declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May God Bless us all and preserve our great nation!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Presiding Bishop of Living Water Pentecostal Church International-Liberia, Wilmot Kotati Bobbroh says President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is not the cause of Ebola in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with this paper, Bishop Bobbroh said people should stop blaming President Sirleaf about the deadly Ebola virus which is killing individuals in Montserrado and other counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Bobbroh disclosed that the Ebola virus is a national curse and God is doing that so that people can repent from their sinful acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bishop Bobbroh, he has heard that President Sirleaf brought Queen of Sheba to share blood in the country but that the information is not true. He argued that Queen of Sheba is a decent woman and people should stop spreading false information.Bishop Bobbroh further told this paper that washing hands with chlorine does not prevent individuals from contracting the deadly Ebola virus, instead by the mercy of God people are surviving in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Bishop Bobbroh has blamed the Liberia Council of Churches for not preaching the truth in their various churches. He said the LCC fails to preach about fornications, homosexualism, lesbianism and other immoral acts that take place in the country, instead they preach prosperity just to get more members in their churches, something he described as very heinous and nefarious to the Liberian society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Bobbroh has therefore called on the Liberia Council of Churches to refrain from such acts and preach about those things that God will heartily embrace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: We have suspended our flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until August 31 due to the deteriorating public health situation. The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the routes under constant review.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington said: It doesn't sound like very good planning to me if they are leaving people stranded who want to leave. They should have brought them out.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the move as 75 per cent over-reaction', adding: I can see why they did it from a PR point of view but from a virological point of view, it is probably not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big fact about Ebola is that it's not that easy to catch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not surprised, but slightly disappointed they have taken that step.' However, another expert said the decision would cut the odds of the disease, which kills up to 90 per cent of victims, from being brought into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said sharing a plane with an Ebola sufferer was extremely dangerous'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: It is more than possible that other people on the plane will become infected.' Public Health Wales, which runs health services in the region, said the suspected patient in Cardiff did not have symptoms and there were no cases in Wales, adding: We are alert to the possibility of cases in the UK and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have travelled from West Africa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said people cannot be tested for the virus before the onset of symptoms, which take up to 21 days to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the individual has been under surveillance for a week and seems well'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, infected American aid worker Nancy Writebol was flown back to Atlanta for treatment yesterday after contracting the disease in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She follows her colleague Dr Kent Brantly, who returned for treatment on Saturday. Both are said to be making progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola victims suffer severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no cure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEVERAL Britons across the country have been quarantined after potentially coming into contact with victims of Ebola, health officials admitted yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disclosure was made as a Welsh national, who fears having possibly contracted the deadly virus while in West Africa, has returned home and placed themselves in &quot;voluntary&quot; quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The potential victim is understood to be living in Cardiff and is &quot;currently staying away from work and limiting contact with other people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The person is being &quot;closely monitored,&quot; doctors from Public Health Wales said, in case they start to show symptoms of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anna Humphries, of Public Health Wales, said: &quot;We have an individual who has travelled in the West Africa region where the outbreak is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Upon returning to Wales a week ago, the individual realised they may have been in contact with people with Ebola, although the risk is minimal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also said there were &quot;several&quot; similar cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are other people in the UK, not in Wales, who have come back from affected countries and have been at risk because whatever they have done while they have been over there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have been in a similar situation and they have been monitored for an incubation period to check they have not gone on to develop symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a process for dealing with returning travellers and this is an example of that. Quarantine really depends on where exactly they have been.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INVESTORS snapped up shares in Imagination Technologies on hopes that the microchip designer will receive a boost when Apple releases its highly anticipated new product range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tech group booked one of the biggest gains in the FTSE 250, jumping 8.9p, or 4.9pc, to 191.1p, on speculation that the launch of the iPhone 6 and iWatch, expected in coming months, will provide a fillip for Imagination's graphics royalties. Apple is Imagination's single biggest customer and accounts for 33pc of revenues, Liberum analyst Eoin Lambe told clients yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Imagination's graphics and video intellectual property is included in all of Apple's mobile products,&quot; he said. &quot;We believe Apple's forthcoming iPhone 6 and iWatch ... could be positive catalysts for Imagination.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traders buy into the FTSE 250 company to gain exposure to the US giant, the analyst explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the past, Imagination's share price has generally performed well into Apple product launches as investors looked for ways to play Apple's growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Optimistic about Imagination's prospects, Mr Lambe upgraded his recommendation on the shares to &quot;buy&quot; and, as a result, the stock was the second biggest riser in a FTSE 250 that dipped 10.66 points to 15,351.91. The FTSE 100 managed to snap four straight sessions of falls to edge up 4.96 to 6,682.48. Weir led London's benchmark index higher, climbing 51p to &pound;25.76 after RBC Capital Markets named shares in the maker of industrial pumps a &quot;top pick&quot;. A touch of bid speculation also lent support to the stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intertek, the product testing group that jumped 173p on six-month results a day earlier, rose a further 49p to &pound;27.55, buoyed by upbeat analyst comments in the wake of its numbers. Well-received half-year earnings from Standard Life pushed the insurer 5.6p higher to 370p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Annuities group Just Retirement put on 8.8p to 148.2p in the FTSE 250, adding to Monday's 2.3p rise. The gains marked a recovery from a period of share price weakness that saw the stock slide 5.4pc over the course of last week. One theory doing the rounds to explain that fall was that Espirito Santo Investment Bank, which helped float the company last year, had been selling shares in Just Retirement, putting pressure on what is a relatively illiquid stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meggitt, a maker of aircraft components, slumped 23.8p to 479.7p - a 4.7pc decline that was the heaviest in the FTSE 100 - after cutting its revenue guidance for the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels, off 77p at &pound;22.88, was marked lower on half-year figures that were not expected to result in significant market upgrades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Overall, we would be surprised if consensus changed in any meaningful way,&quot; Geof Collyer of Deutsche Bank told clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staying with the fallers, analysts at Credit Suisse pushed Royal Mail down 15.2p to 405&frac12;p - the lowest level since its initial public offering - by repeating their &quot;underperform&quot; rating and slashing their price target to 360p, just 30p above the company's float price. The analysts think Royal Mail will miss its 2015 margin guidance, and forecast a 30 basis-point rise against Royal Mail's expectations for a 50 basis-point improvement. They put the miss down to a range of headwinds, including the &quot;well-flagged competitive pressures&quot; posed by rival TNT Post UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Housebuilders were broadly weaker following Monday's news that Lloyds was capping loans made under the Help to Buy scheme. Persimmon slid 27p to &pound;12.19 and Barratt Developments was down 7.4p at 337&frac12;p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afren, the oil explorer that plunged last week when it suspended its chief executive and chief operating officer, remained unsettled by the shock development and tumbled a further 8.9p to 98.1p. Analysts at UBS didn't help by slashing their price target to 135p from 200p, although they kept their &quot;buy&quot; recommendation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Restoration of investor confidence will require a root and branch audit of Afren's historical transactions,&quot; they said. &quot;Until this is complete we expect the market to continue to apply a high discount to the equity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Aim, Sierra Leone-focused iron ore producers London Mining, down 2&frac34;p at 35p, and African Minerals (AMI), off 11p at 47p, were sold lower amid worries about the potential impact of the Ebola outbreak in the country. Should the Ebola virus disrupt AMI's operations, it may heighten concerns about the company's ability to continue to meet interest payments on its debt, analysts said. Those worries could explain why AMI fell far heavier than London Mining yesterday, they added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, big data group WANdisco jumped 10&frac34;p to 442&frac34;p on Aim after announcing it had secured a $10m credit facility with HSBC, news that alleviated concerns the company would tap the investors for funds via a share sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When my 65-year-old mother visited my foundation's office recently, she was covered from head to toe in a long winter coat and headdress despite it being 28C. She explained that she wanted extra protection against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the outbreak worsened I urged my parents to leave Monrovia. But my mother, a vibrant and protective member of her community, refuses. She is the sole carer for my grandmother, a centenarian who is too frail and stubborn to travel. She stays because she loves her home and her community. She stays for Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Liberia celebrated the 10th anniversary of the end of a long and bloody civil war. We proudly marked the milestone and were optimistic about the future. Half a generation of children have no memory of war. Businesses have grown, students attend schools, and many compatriots have returned home. When I travel internationally, I proudly display my Liberian passport. After the election of Africa's first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the 2011 Nobel peace prize awards, my country was famous for something other than child soldiers and a despot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now we face a new enemy from within. Liberia is battling a virulence that threatens to destroy our progress. The Ebola outbreak has closed all schools. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and two airlines have stopped flights to the country. Ebola is resurrecting old traumas for Liberians who survived the war. Those with the right passports are able to leave. Those with resources can buy soap and protective gear to keep safe. But people cannot conduct their business as usual. Children no longer attend classes, and many are shuttered inside their homes. My brave sisters, who protested along with me against the civil war, are back again. Clothed in white T-shirts, they gather together to pray for a reprieve and offer passersby water with which to wash their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response to the crisis was initially underwhelming. Our healthcare providers lacked necessary supplies, such as gloves, masks and bleach. This week's US-Africa Leaders Summit - hosted by Barack Obama in Washington - underscores the point that Africa's development is in every nation's interest. But it is the needs at local level that worry me most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the outbreak, Liberia had fewer than 300 doctors for a population of 3.5 million people. With so few doctors to care for Ebola victims, non-related ailments are overlooked. For children and the elderly, treatable diseases are much more deadly. For pregnant women, the few facilities for childbirth have narrowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a friend was turned away from the hospital. Her first child was delivered outside the maternity ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month ago, Saint Joseph's Catholic Hospital in Monrovia welcomed with a fanfare a new ECG machine. Its director, Dr Patrick Nshamdze, caught the virus last month and died on Saturday. The hospital is now closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People need direct funds to care for their families as the government scrambles to create a cohesive health response network where none existed before. The outbreak will end when individuals understand the disease and adopt safe and sanitary practices to feed and care for each other. My foundation organised two information sessions, for community groups from across Liberia to distribute posters and fund prevention and outreach efforts. Some groups drove up to eight hours to receive material. Since efforts at the macro level are flailing, Liberians must be vigilant with their own families and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This epidemic is rewriting how we care for one other. But we must also equip communities with the resources they need. A slapdash government response has aided Ebola's spread . The purpose of the US-Africa Leaders Summit is to secure development funds for governments. Let's also provide resources to the people who are most vulnerable to Ebola. Liberia has so much more to give to the world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of soldiers have been deployed in Sierra Leone and Liberia in an attempt to quarantine the remote villages at the centre of the Ebola outbreak, as three new cases were discovered in Nigeria and authorities in Saudi Arabia said a man was being tested for suspected infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saudi health ministry said a man in his 40s who had recently returned from Sierra Leone had shown symptoms of viral haemorrhagic fever and was being treated at a specialist hospital in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. The patient is in isolation and blood samples are being tested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the epidemic entered its seventh month, 700 troops in Sierra Leone began setting up roadblocks to ensure that only health personnel could move in and out of the hardest-hit communities. They include two eastern districts where health workers have sometimes been attacked by residents who fear that treatment centres are causing Ebola to spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military spokesman, Yayah Brima, said food and medical supplies would be ferried in by convoys, and 50 military nurses would provide medical assistance to the soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor enforcement and medical practices in remote areas, combined with high volumes of cross-border travel, have fuelled the outbreak, which has so far claimed 887 lives. Ebola is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat and surfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Border controls alone give a false sense of security,&quot; said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who oversaw the global response to the Sars outbreak in 2003. &quot;You cannot keep Ebola out using only that because people can still get to places where there aren't controls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside contact-tracing, he said, &quot;the best defence is properly understanding how it is spread, stopping it spreading further, and making sure health workers are able to self-protect with up-to-par hospital controls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to contain the outbreak have been hampered as those on the frontline have been among the hardest hit. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctors died last month. Clinics in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, were closing their doors because doctors were too afraid to treat patients, Reuters reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways has suspended flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of August to help try to contain the virus. The airline had been flying four times a week to the two countries. BA said customers with tickets on those routes were being offered refunds or the option to rebook flights for a later date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the route under constant review in the coming weeks,&quot; BA said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria a doctor who treated a Liberian-American man who had travelled from Monrovia has contracted the virus, and another health worker and a third citizen who had travelled to Guinea are displaying probable signs of haemorrhagic fever, the World Health Organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A morgue in Nigeria's southern state of Anambra has been sealed while tests are carried out on a deceased person, said the health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enuka Egbon, a fruit trader in the Lagos district where eight people are being held in an isolation ward after coming into contact with the Liberian-American victim, said: &quot;It's really scary because we have no choice but to keep going out and keep using crowded buses and shopping in markets. And Lagos is a city where there is very little breathing space.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two US volunteer doctors who contracted the disease arrived in the US, where they are being treated with an experimental serum. Nancy Writebol and Kent Brantly of the charity Samaritan's Purse were said to be critical but improving after using the serum. &quot;Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition was nearly reversed. His breathing improved; the rash over his trunk faded away,&quot; CNN reported, citing sources involved in the pair's treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the WHO announced a $200m (&pound;120m) emergency fund. On the last day of July, the latest day for which statistics are available, 163 new cases were reported, the WHO said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurse and five other people now battling the virus had helped care for Liberian-American Patrick Sawyer, who died from Ebola</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has died of the virus in Lagos as five new cases of the highly lethal disease were confirmed in Africa's most populous nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse had helped care for Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who last month visited from Liberia, one of three countries in the region hit by the world's biggest epidemic. The five new cases are believed to be other health workers who came into contact with Sawyer, who died within days of his arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total death toll from the Ebola outbreak has now risen to 932 after another 45 patients died between 2 and 4 August, the World Health Organisation said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday the first known Nigerian to die of Ebola was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other five [newly confirmed] cases are being treated at an isolation ward,&quot; the Nigerian health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters in the capital, Abuja, on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials initially downplayed the risk of exposure, saying Sawyer had been immediately isolated when he collapsed on arrival at Lagos's bustling main airport two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But state health commissioner Jide Idris on Tuesday said Ebola was diagnosed only after Sawyer had been taken to hospital and had had direct or indirect contact with at least 70 others. They include airline passengers, airport officials and health workers, and have all been placed under precautionary surveillance. Seven have been quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told reporters they were compiling a list of secondary contacts, and appealed to those who believed they may be at risk to come forward. &quot;This is a call for everyone to be vigilant, especially with regard to relating to people who are ill,&quot; Idris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days, meaning symptoms don't necessarily show before then. Once transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of infected persons, meat or surfaces, a fever quickly degenerates into internal and external bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea, which all contain vast amounts of the pathogen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new committee to deal with any potential escalation of the disease has been set up, although Nigerian officials admitted there was a shortage of doctors willing to work directly with confirmed cases. &quot;Our doctors are worried about the danger it poses to their lives and the need to be reassured,&quot; said Tope Ojo, Lagos chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors and healthcare workers on the frontline have been the hardest hit during the outbreak which has so far killed 887 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Authorities said they were considering applying for an experimental drug used on two Americans to treat the doctor who headed Sawyer's team and is now battling the virus herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other preventative measures have been unveiled across Nigeria. Lagos, a melting pot of some 20 million people, has broadcast information on radios and through leaflets, distributed protective clothing to health workers and set up four isolation wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the northern state of Kaduna, officials said corpses from outside the country would require special permission for burial. Two suspected Ebola-infected corpses in the southern states of Anambra and Akwa Ibom are believed to be victims flown in from Guinea. Authorities have sealed the morgues while samples are being tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, troops were deployed in Sierra Leone and Liberia to help protect medical workers and quarantine the villages at the centre of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ivory Coast a regional athletic contest due to be held this month has been cancelled. &quot;There was really no benefit in holding the games until things are under control. We don't want to trigger hysteria,&quot; sports minister Alain Lobognon told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Spokesman Sam Collins told the NEWS Tuesday that the individuals were rescued at different locations in Duport Road, Capitol Bye-Pass and Soul Clinic communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins said community members from these areas complained that the suspects were allegedly bent on poisoning the wells in their communities. He said the suspects were rescued when they were been mobbed by the community dwellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman Collins explained that the water which is said to have been contaminated with poison is being tested by the police. He said other instruments are also in police custody as part of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins did not name the four suspects but said they are being investigated in connection with claims that have been involved with the contamination of water wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A human rights lawyer alarmed over the silence of Police authorities to state the names of persons held in their custody in connection with reports of an alleged poisoning of wells in Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference at his Ashman Street office Tuesday, Cllr. T. Dempster Brown told journalists that he has continued to receive reports from residents that several wells have been allegedly poisoned by some individuals in the wake of the Ebola virus outbreak in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unfolding situation, Cllr. Brown observed, has led to the mass deaths and burials of citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Brown told reporters that Ebola has reached the level that people have begun to panic on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown claimed that he received reports that police arrested several persons in the ELWA Community for allegedly putting chemical in a well resulting to the deaths of some people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said when he visited the police station Monday to meet with Police Director, Col. Chris Massaquoi, he allegedly acted as if he was too busy to talk with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights advocate alleged that a man was almost mobbed to death on allegation of attempting to poison a well at Tubman's yard on Lynch Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said as a lawyer, he does not have interest in defending the man, but his concerns are who are sponsoring them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services Tolbert Nyenswah said the virus is seriously undermining the country's health delivery system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister Nyenswah wants Liberians to adhere to the preventive measures so as to prevent new infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister Nyenswah urged Liberians doubting the virus to desist because it is endangering government and partners' interventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Ministry of Health is taking the virus serious by engaging its five strategic components, but said denial was a major obstacle to the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah cited treatment, social mobilization, and psychosocial as some of the five components the Ministry is putting into place to contain the virus spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister said the virus which is already undermining the health of citizens in Liberia, Sierra and Guinea has reached an unprecedented level in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah noted that the virus insurgence has reached to a point where those doubting its existence need to rethink because it does not discriminate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Providing update on the virus, Minister Nyenswah disclosed that from May 29, 2014 to present, cumulated cases have hit 352, with 95 of them confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He puts the confirmed numbers of people who have died of the virus to 76, with health workers accounting for 26. He further put cumulative deaths (parable, confirmed and suspected) at 170.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister explained that Ebola is not contracted from diet, dirty water but through close contact with an ill person who is infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus, according to him, is now present in seven of the 15 counties including Montserrado, Margibi, Bong, Nimba, Lofa, Bomi and Grand Cape Mount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">868 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the latest death toll from the West Africa Ebola epidemic now at 887, the World Bank Group has pledged as much as US$200 million in emergency funding to help Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone contain the spread of Ebola infections, help their communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis, and improve public health systems throughout West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Bank Group President, Dr. Jim Yong Kim, a medical doctor experienced in treatment of infectious diseases, said the new financing commitment was in response to a call from both the three African countries hardest-hit by Ebola and the World Health Organization (WHO) for immediate assistance to contain the outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the World Bank Group would also step up social safety net assistance for affected communities and families and help to build up public health systems in West Africa to strengthen the region's disease control capacity more generally. Kim said he would brief the Bank Group's Board of Executive Directors as soon as possible on the latest state of the epidemic and seek their approval for the new emergency package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very worried that many more lives are at risk unless we can stop this Ebola epidemic in its tracks,&quot; Kim said. &quot;I have been monitoring its deadly impact around the clock and am deeply saddened at how it has ravaged health workers, families and communities, disrupted normal life, and has led to a breakdown of already weak health systems in the three countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim added: &quot;The international community needs to act fast to contain and stop this Ebola outbreak. I believe this new World Bank emergency funding will provide critically needed support for the response to stop the further transmission of Ebola within Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which would prevent new infections in neighboring at-risk countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim, whose announcement came on the first day of the US-Africa Summit in Washington D.C, said that the new financial pledge would pay for urgently needed medical supplies, salaries for medical staff, and other vital materials to stabilize the health system, while also helping communities cope with financial hardship caused by the epidemic. The new Bank Group package will also help to build up the region's disease surveillance and laboratory networks to guard against future epidemic outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO leadership, he said, was vital to international and regional efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic, which is West Africa's first-ever outbreak of Ebola virus disease but has become the largest ever in the nearly four-decade history of this disease. The World Bank Group he said would work in close coordination with the WHO and other partners such as ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States. The WHO has now set up an Ebola response center in Conakry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;WHO welcomes this support from the World Bank, which comes at a time when concern about the Ebola virus disease is escalating,&quot; said WHO Director General, Dr. Margaret Chan, in Geneva. &quot;The demands created by this unprecedented outbreak outstrip the capacity of affected countries in West Africa to respond. So funding to increase national response capacities is a fundamentally important way to slow transmission and prevent spread to other areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Ebola virus now directly and indirectly impacting economies in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and neighboring countries, the new World Bank Group emergency response will also help countries and communities cope with financial hardship caused by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial World Bank-IMF assessment for Guinea projects a full percentage point fall in GDP growth from 4.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Agriculture has also been affected in all three countries as rural workers have fled farming areas in the affected zones. To date, there has been no measurable impact on the food supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-border commerce has slowed considerably with land crossings closed to neighboring countries and more recently cancellation of flights. Ghana has closed its airspace to flights from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and there have been noticeably fewer international flights to these countries, leading to lower revenues and financial inflows, and many projects involving expatriate workers or business travelers have been scaled down. In the mining sector, if the evacuation of skilled expatriate staff continues, there will be a sizable decline in production. In Liberia, schools have been closed as part of the government-declared state of emergency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank's Vice President for Africa, Makhtar Diop, said the Bank's latest emergency response will also include social safety net measures to help families and communities trying to cope with financial loss as a result of the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will build up safety net protection measures for families and communities in the affected countries in light of the further hardship we expect Ebola will create for people who were already poor and vulnerable to begin with. They face the prospect of losing breadwinners and widespread disruption of their livelihoods which is why over and above containing the spread of the epidemic we also must help people in West Africa cope with its impact on their lives,&quot; Diop said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman of the newly established People's Unification Party (PUP) Isobee Gborkorkollie says the government has failed the Liberian people by refusing to close its borders to contain the spread of Ebola disease when it first entered the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the PUP Chairman, fears have placed its hands on every Liberian and international partners as a result of the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that health workers and other Liberians are losing their lives to Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gborkorkollie said families are abandoning their relatives because of the nature and characteristics of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the President of Liberia should take full responsibility for the current situation Liberia is faced with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PUP Chairman said government latest move aimed at eradicating Ebola from Liberia is belated and has undermined the security of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He therefore called on the National Legislature to establish whether the President's failure to protect Liberians from Ebola amounts to impeachment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Gborkorkollie also called for the resignation of the Ministers of Health, Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the three ministers 'failed' to act in terms of coming up with mechanism to save Liberians from the deadly Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, there are glaring signs that some Liberians have developed enmity against their compatriots who have contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, those infested with the virus, have been abandoned at health centers by their relatives while less attention continues to be shown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the International Foundation for Human Dignity (FIND) has raised a number of issues concerning the way and manner in which individuals infested with the Ebola virus are being ill-treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roosevelt Woods, FIND's Executive Director says his institution has investigated and uncovered how some Ebola victims have been stigmatized because of their medical conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some Ebola victims who are currently undergoing treatment at various health centers have been abandoned, while less attention is being shown by their respective family members, and in some cases, medical staff due to the contagious nature of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods explained that from the investigation, FIND uncovered how some Ebola patients are not given food, water and other fluid that would help to sustain them, instead of leaving them to die with hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that quarantined individuals should be able to have access to their family, food, water and other items, but not to abandon them to die because of their unfortunate condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Woods called on the Liberian government to ensure that all health facilities that were closed be reopened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government is under constitutional obligation to ensure that doctors, nurses, and other health workers are provided protective gears so that they would be in the position to save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods observed that due to the closure of health facilities across the country, the Liberian people are dying from different medical conditions (other than Ebola) which he thinks is unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIND Executive Director said he has spoken with health workers in the central Liberian town of Gbarnga, who expressed their willingness to resume work, provided government re-opens hospitals, provide protective gears and other supports for their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the closure of health facilities in Gbarnga and other parts of the country would exacerbate the already appalling health system. Woods also wants the government to provide additional ambulance in Bong County.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is calling on all Liberians to observe three days of National Fast and Prayer beginning Wednesday, August 6 through Friday, August 8, 2014 from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Acknowledging our devout gratitude to God for our existence as a Free, Sovereign and Independent State, and relying on His Divine Guidance for our survival as a Nation, I call on all Liberians to observe three days of National Fast and Prayer to seek God's face to have mercy on us and forgive our sins and heal our land, Liberia, as we continue the fight against the deadly Ebola virus,&quot; the Liberian leader urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said this call is indicative that God is the ultimate solution of this crisis and source of Liberia's deliverance as a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the observance of the National Fast and Prayer is being held under the auspices of the Liberia Council of Churches (LCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Religious Advisor to the President, Rev. Jervis Witherspoon, who is also a member of the LCC, said that to climax the National Fast and Prayer on Friday, August 8th, a team of religious leaders will meet at the old Providence Baptist Church on Broad Street to lead prayers for the nation during the last three hours, beginning at 3:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state broadcaster, Liberia Broadcasting System, and other radio stations will carry a simulcast and anyone who is unable to attend the service in person can tune in and monitor the climax of the National Fast and Prayer Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious leaders will offer prayers for the spiritual, moral and physical restoration of the land including prayers for the elimination of Ebola and other pestilence from the country; prayer for comfort and strength for hurting families who have lost loved ones; prayer for healing and restoration of quarantined individuals in the land; prayer for the protection of health workers and other volunteers in harm's way as they fight the deadly Ebola virus; prayer against any form of witchcraft activity used to spread Ebola virus; as well as prayer for God's intervention in the sub-regional counties (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia) affected by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are calling on all Liberians to join in this time of true national repentance and prayer against the Ebola virus,&quot; Rev. Witherspoon urged his fellow compatriots, adding, &quot;We believe, in accordance to the scripture, that God will hear our prayer, forgive our sins and heal the land.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY HAZEL SOUTHAM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiting at Frankfurt airport, my head started to spin. Then, as I got on the plane, I collapsed. I remember begging the purser to let me fly home, but to no avail. You're too sick for us to look after,' he said, and called an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd been in Ethiopia for a week, working as a reporter, and I'd been bitten by mosquitoes and also developed diarrhoea. I was running a temperature, had a rash, a splitting headache and ached all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I'd been covering foreign stories for nearly 20 years, so exhaustion, mosquitoes and travellers' tummy were familiar territory. Yet nagging away at my brain was the idea that this time something wasn't right.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with interviews to be done, I pushed the worry away and got on with work. It was just normal travel bugs, I told myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even collapsing at the airport didn't change this view. The German doctor at the airport clinic asked some questions, including about where I'd been, and diagnosed diarrhoea and dehydration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He put me on a drip to rehydrate me and I lay there for five hours, drifting in and out of consciousness. I was then passed as OK to travel and flew home. It was the start of nearly two months of misdiagnosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience has left me wondering how likely is it that British airport staff or medics will be able to spot or diagnose Ebola and just what the implications are of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was September 2011 when I collapsed en route from Ethiopia. Once we arrived in Britain, my colleague, photographer Clare Kendall, voiced her concerns: Your eyes are full of blood and your head's swollen.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we had a trip to Nicaragua a month later to prepare for, so after a few days' rest I was working again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only I couldn't work properly. After one meeting, I wrote in my diary that I was overtaken by bone-aching weariness and had to go to bed for two hours'. And so it went on until, just a few days before we were due to fly to Nicaragua, I collapsed in the back garden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I rang my GP practice and was given an emergency appointment at my local hospital, where the doctor said I had a urinary tract infection. Hugely relieved, I took the tablets he prescribed and went home confident that I'd be well enough to fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I wasn't. When I stand up or walk, I feel lightheaded and everything spins round,' I wrote in my diary. I rang NHS Direct, who said it might be vertigo. They told me to ring my GP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My memory of that month or so is hazy, but I missed the Nicaragua trip because, essentially, I couldn't stand up. Or do anything much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Towards the end of October 2011, I collapsed again and the GP referred me for extensive tests at the hospital. These took six hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On OCTOBER 29, I received a letter saying that the tests showed I had antibodies for not one but three conditions: West Nile virus (which is carried by mosquitoes), dengue fever (another mosquito-borne illness, with similar symptoms) and tick-borne encephalitis (spread by ticks, and which can spread to the brain).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder I didn't feel well. All three conditions are potentially fatal, and after reading the letter, I sat in the kitchen and shook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then I rang a friend who had studied medicine. His view was that I currently had West Nile virus and dengue fever. (The encephalitis antibodies were the result of a trip to Jordan two years before, when flu-like symptoms had developed into meningitis.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had the full list of classic symptoms of both West Nile virus and dengue fever: a fever, pain behind the eyes, aching bones, muscle pain, feeling sick, a skin rash, sore throat, diarrhoea and blood in my stools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably, my condition had been hard to diagnose because cases of West Nile virus and dengue fever are fairly rare both at Frankfurt airport and in leafy Hampshire, where I live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the misdiagnosis had meant I didn't seek medical help more quickly. There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus and dengue, apart from rest, fluids and paracetamol, and by then I was over the worst. But early diagnosis is important to be alert for any complications. Dengue fever, for instance, can lead to a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure, or catastrophic bleeding (dengue haemorraghic shock).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been a salutary lesson and one that last year I was grateful to have learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd returned from a trip to Shanghai where, again, a mosquito had bitten me. A week after my return I was still feeling rough, so this time I immediately rang my GP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not well. I've been in Shanghai. A mosquito bit me. I've had dengue fever. What do you think?' I asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria, she said, probably. She sent me straight to hospital where a truly wonderful consultant kept me in for 24 hours and did lots of blood tests. They were all sent to scientists at the medical labs at Porton Down, the Government's military science facility (this is where all UK tests for tropical diseases are sent). This both worried and reassured me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultant was concerned that I was going to start bleeding. So was I. Having heard of people who've bled to death in a matter of days, I didn't want to be one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dengue haemorrhaghic fever is a risk if you have antibodies in your blood system from a previous infection; other risk factors are being aged under 12, female and Caucasian. I fit three out of four of those which is why I'm now avoiding dengue regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spent a night in an emergency medical ward. After 24 hours, and with the reassurance that some of the test results had already come back clear, I was discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks later, confirmation came through that I hadn't got dengue fever but I did have some unknown Chinese virus. Again, there was no specific treatment, but this time I was back to full health after three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all this leads me to conclude that it's very difficult for both patient and doctor to know what's wrong with you when you return from foreign travel with a list of symptoms and, as a patient, it's hard to know when to seek help, and how much to push for it, when you don't know what's wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agrees, and says this is why it's important to seek expert advice early on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are feeling sick and have come back from somewhere tropical, the first thing is to get help,' he says and make a point of mentioning you've been on holiday, and where.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have a fever, ask your GP to check it's not malaria. There are plenty of other viral infections that are self-limiting and aren't going to kill you, but you can die of malaria very quickly,' says Professor Mabey. However, it's easily treatable.' International travel means more of us are returning home with tropical diseases such as dengue. Some 2,000 cases of malaria are reported in the UK every year: in 2013, seven people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to Public Health England (PHE), dengue fever is on the rise. In 2011 (the year I caught it) there were 223 cases; in 2012, there were 343, a 54 per cent rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a lot more malaria and we still see leprosy, which is mis-diagnosed because people don't think of it,' says Professor Mabey. And we see the odd case of sleeping sickness [caused by a parasite]. But none of these are common.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For GPs all of this presents an enormous challenge because they are simply not experienced in these rare, though sometimes deadly, health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Professor Simon de Lusignan, a GP and director of the Royal College of GPs Research and Surveillance Centre, which keeps an eye on outbreaks of everything from flu to Ebola, says he's seen only three or four cases of tropical illness in his 27-year career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to diagnose tropical diseases,' he says. Flu-like symptoms could be so many things.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean for a virus such as Ebola, with an incubation period of up to 21 days?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current outbreak has been centred on Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, but the concern is that, with international travel, the virus could spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several West African airlines have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Hong Kong, officials have confirmed they will quarantine any visitors from the affected countries who have a fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, PHE said the Government was taking precautionary measures'. It told Good Health these involved telling agency staff and health professionals what the symptoms are'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But airport staff&nbsp; who are on the front line have said that they are not ready to deal with an outbreak of Ebola in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, said last week: Our members are very concerned. What do they do if they are confronted with someone who doesn't appear well?' She added that she would absolutely not' be able to spot the symptoms' of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHE points out that most general travellers are unlikely to have come into contact with the virus. Their director for health protection, Dr Paul Cosford, told Good Health this week: The risk to this country is very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are concerned about the threat in West Africa, but we don't think that it will cause an outbreak in the UK.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus is transmitted through eating infected bush meat (such as monkeys) and exposure to the body fluids of those who are sick NOT from sneezing or coughing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advice from Public Health England is that if you've been to one of the affected countries (Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea) and experience a fever, headache and general malaise within 21 days of your return to the UK, seek immediate medical help. Other early symptoms include sore throat, joint and muscle pain. These escalate to a rash, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain and impaired kidney and liver function, which may be followed by internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of a second case in Lagos, Africa's biggest and most densely populated city and an international transport hub, will fan fears the disease, which kills up to 90 per cent of victims, will spread to the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has claimed nearly 900 lives in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new case is a doctor who helped treat Patrick Sawyer, an American finance consultant who died in a Lagos hospital after flying into the city from his sister's funeral in Liberia. She had also died of the disease, which can be spread through sweat and saliva and has no vaccine or cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said three other medical staff are showing symptoms. Some 70 people who came into contact with Mr Sawyer are under surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Anthony Fauci, of the National Institutes of Health, has said a vaccine against Ebola could be ready by next summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Professor Chris Whitty, the Department for International Development's chief scientist, has urged calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: What we hope is that with good management and good control we should be able to start to see the peak of the epidemic and then it start to decrease.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile fears Ebola had reached Britain at the weekend proved groundless, after a passenger who died after flying into Gatwick from Sierra Leone tested negative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN EXPERIMENTAL serum treatment on two US missionaries has raised hopes of an effective treatment for Ebola after doctors reported a &quot;miraculous&quot; improvement in the health of one of those who contracted the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The development came as a leading British scientist claimed the end of the Ebola epidemic may be in sight, with the disease already peaking in the county where the outbreak originated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Witty, an adviser to the Department for International Development and a professor of public and international health, said Guinea had already seen the worst of the outbreak and cases were now beginning to decrease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the number of infections is continuing to rise in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Prof Witty said the situation was likely to peak soon and then the epidemic would begin to decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The outbreak is very unusual,&quot; he said in a podcast. &quot;This is the largest outbreak of Ebola that so far has been recorded. The numbers are increasing in Sierra Leone but they appear to have peaked in Guinea where the epidemic first started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we hope is that with good management and good control we should be able to start to see the peak of the epidemic and then it will start to decrease.&quot; As the death toll from the epidemic in west Africa reached at least 887 by Aug 1, the total number of cases in the four west African countries affected stood at 1,603 on the same date, the World Health Organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The body also confirmed that Nigeria was now dealing with four cases of Ebola, including a doctor who treated Patrick Sawyer, a US lawyer who died in Lagos last month after contracting the disease in Liberia, spreading panic in Africa's biggest city. Just three vials of the experimental serum known as &quot;ZMapp&quot;, which had only previously been tested on monkeys, were flown to Liberia for the treatment of two US missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kent Brantly, 33, who has since been flown to an isolation unit in Atlanta, at first insisted that the serum be given to his older colleague, Nancy Writebol, 59, but when his own condition deteriorated sharply he was given the first dose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Within an hour of receiving the medication, Brantly's condition was nearly reversed. His breathing improved; the rash over his trunk faded away. One of his doctors described the events as 'miraculous',&quot; reported CNN, citing sources with first-hand knowledge of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A flight carrying Ms Writebol, who is in a &quot;serious&quot; condition, left Liberia last night headed for Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ZMapp&quot;, which had been developed by a San Diego-based company, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, is a one of a class of new drugs known as &quot;monoclonal antibodies&quot; that use proteins to prevent the Ebola virus from infecting new cells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The threat of the Ebola outbreak cast a shadow over a US-Africa Summit that opened in Washington DC yesterday attended by nearly 50 African heads of state, although the presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone were forced to cancel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit was meant to present Africa as an investment destination and break stereotypes about the continent as a place of war and disease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A doctor who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has himself contracted the deadly virus, raising fears that the seven-month-long epidemic in three west African nations could spread in the continent's most populous country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor was part of a team that attended to Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who collapsed on arrival at Lagos airport last month. Sawyer had flown from Liberia's capital, Monrovia, with flight stopovers in nearby Ghana and Togo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As at today, one of the doctors that treated the late Mr Sawyer has tested positive to the Ebola virus,&quot; the health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters in the capital, Abuja. Officials said they had identified 70 people with whom Sawyer had been in contact, eight of whom had been transferred to isolation wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic has killed 887 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The countries' leaders held a crisis summit in Guinea's capital, Conakry, last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation said the outbreak was moving faster than efforts to control it, and warned that the more people were infected, the greater the risk of the virus evolving into deadlier mutations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Lagos have rapidly introduced a series of preventive measures, including quarantining the hospital where Sawyer was treated, distributing protective clothing to health workers and screening air and sea passengers arriving from at-risk countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information about the virus has been widely broadcast on radio stations, and some traders have begun cashing in with the sale of hand sanitiser branded &quot;Ebola cleansing hand gels&quot;. In the downtown business district where Sawyer was treated, a handful of traders could be seen wearing face masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, health officials visited the church of the &quot;super-pastor&quot; TB Joshua, which attracts 50,000 worshippers weekly. &quot;We asked that the church leadership be aware of the important role they have to play in preventing Ebola from spreading,&quot; a member of the delegation told the Guardian. &quot;Also we warned that they do not hold 'healing sessions' as we are concerned Ebola sufferers might travel from outside the country to the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to contain the disease were hampered in Liberia and Sierra Leone as faith healers and crowded churches sheltered Ebola victims who they claimed to be able to cure. Both countries eventually made such action a crime punishable with jail terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passed on through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, surfaces and bush meat, Ebola has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment. It is contagious only once symptoms begin to show and can rapidly degenerate into external and internal bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic is already having an impact on Nigeria. A South Korean university banned three Nigerian students from attending a summit, and a Nigerian delegation attending a US-Africa summit is believed to have been screened on arrival in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, health workers and officials said they had been overwhelmed by the spiralling death toll amid a shortage of resources. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said there were critical gaps in tackling the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current response to the Ebola outbreak is entirely insufficient compared to the needs, and there needs to be greater mobilisation on the ground. MSF does not have a clear overview of the most affected areas and it is believed that people are still dying in their villages without access to medical care,&quot; the organisation said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US said it was sending a team of 50 specialists to the region this week. The British Red Cross has launched an appeal to raise funds. The WHO has set up a $100m (&pound;60m) fund to boost a regional emergency response.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Mahmoud since the death of the Catholic Hospital's Chief Administrator, Patrick Nshamdze (Bro.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Egyptian doctor earlier this week was called on a local radio station to clarify whether he was affected by the Ebola virus that has claimed over one hundred lives throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious tension mounted yesterday at the New Georgia Junction when some residents alleged that their hand pumps have been contaminated with some strange chemicals by unknown individuals. The news of the alleged contamination or poisoning of the three wells at the New Georgia Junction led to serious commotion when some angry residents mostly youths including women set up road blocks on the Somalia Drive thus, preventing vehicles from plying the road for several hours.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Madam Massara Kromah, owner of one of the hand pumps, some strange men riding in a white jeep disembarked their vehicle at about 2:00 A.M. and began using chisels to open holes on top of the hand pumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Kromah alleged that while in her room, she heard some strange sound like a person bursting something on the hand pump. She further stated, &quot;I went to the door and spotted a man opening the top of the pump and what I saw was the same man pouring a liquid into the well with some similar to the needle used for injections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Kromah said while the man was doing his sinister act, she called some of her neighbors from their various houses but unfortunately for them the alleged criminal escaped the scene and left the unidentified chemical wasting on the ground by the well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the residents spoken to said the strange chemical smelt like a poisonous chemical and due to the pungent smell, the pump has been closed to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When quizzed as what could have been the motive behind such act, Kromah said people are poisoning hand pumps and wells to carry on mass killings and blame such on the deadly Ebola virus. She further alleged that those in the jeep are believed to be government officials or their agents sent on the field to kill people in some communities and say they were killed by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many persons are also wondering as to the reason for the poisoning or contamination of wells and hand pumps in recent times. They want government to take the appropriate steps by putting security on the alert to arrest those involved in such unscrupulous acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, it was reported that 25 persons died from the poisoning of wells in Unification Town, Margibi County. The situation occurred following a funeral service at the Zion Healing Holy Church. One person has been arrested in connection with the alleged poisoning of the wells in Dolo's Town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unspecified number of Ebola victims were finally buried yesterday in the Township of Johnsonville following three days of contention between security forces and community dwellers in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to community members, the burial of the victims in their area which they claimed is a private property is worrisome and could spark a serious health hazard especially since the bodies were left open since Saturday up to the time of their proper burial yesterday at about 3 p.m.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source explained to the INQUIRER that the burial was delayed because the first bulldozer that was taken to the site for the job stuck in the mud thus prompting the hiring of a second bulldozer that finally did the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sando Menn who spoke to the INQUIRER few miles away from the burial site yesterday said since Saturday, the bodies were left covered with leaves , a situation that have brought about serious fear in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said passing through individuals' yards with the bodies in trucks onward to the burial site was something more frightening to the residents. She further said anyone who protested for the trucks not to use their premises was met by serious police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They beat my sister yesterday when she tried to stop them from passing in our yard but when they saw the journalists' car approaching they jumped into their vehicle and left the scene,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when the INQUIRER reached the burial site yesterday a bulldozer was about to properly bury the Ebola victims a job which took about an hour and half as officers of the Liberia National Police (LNP) and some health workers looked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another resident of the area said since Saturday, the bodies were left in a hole that was not properly excavated and when it rained some of the bodies were seen floating because the area is close to a water way close to the pipeline community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Commissioner of Johnsonville was contacted at his office in the township, the INQUIRER was told that he had gone to Monrovia to attend to some important matters but when he was contacted via telephone, he denied knowing the site of the burial in the township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Melvin Bettie told the INQUIRER that when the Government of Liberia first proposed to bury the Ebola victims at the Johnsonville Cemetery, he rejected the idea because the spot is close to the school edifice in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bettie said it was then that the government decided to find a place and he was later informed that the burial site was purchased by government from a private owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there is serious contention in the area by many citizens on ground that the place belongs to them and some are in process of erecting dwelling structures in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizens are also worried that the burial site is a place that is in the water way and they are afraid that this might cause a serious health hazard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A health worker who spoke the INQUIRER at the site also noted that after the burial, the place was sprayed and there is no need for the people of that locale to panic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization has embarked on a vigorous inspection at various borders linking Liberia to Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BIN team headed by Cllr. Lemuel Reeves, Commissioner and Deputy Attorney General made the declaration at the Bo Waterside border post over the weekend when he led an array of top BIN officers to inspect Bo-Waterside.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Reeves said their tour was in accordance with the mandate from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf instructing the BIN to ensure that all borders that are opened are properly monitored. Col. Reeves provided safety tips to officers and told them to be careful when interacting with people leaving and coming to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization has called for logistical support to enable her discharge her duty most effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Minor River Union Township Commissioner has appealed for more equipment including motor bikes to members of the joint security and health workers to curb Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it assists health workers and officers of the joint security to get to those places on time when news of an Ebola outbreak is announced, especially during this rainy season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taywor District Commissioner disclosed that her office is working with both healthcare workers and the joint security, especially officers of the Bureau of Immigration in implementing the President's mandate by sensitizing the people about the danger of the disease as well as the various preventive measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She used the occasion to thank Commissioner Reeves and his team for their visit and for the supply of assorted protective gears including buckets, gloves and face masks to members of the joint security at the border; adding, &quot;This will help in curbing the spread of the disease not only in Grand Cape Mount County but Liberia at large&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She admonished the joint security team to use the safety gears provided to them properly in keeping with preventive health tips from health workers assigned at the border alongside them; noting, &quot;This is a national emergency that requires the effort of all of us and not the President alone&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">809 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Morweh Energy Group in Liberia, Mr. Christopher Z. Neyor says the spread of the deadly Ebola virus across the country is due to the colossal failure of the Unity Party (UP) led leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the &quot;national calamity&quot; of the Ebola epidemic that currently exists in the country is &quot;tantamount to a colossal failure of our leadership.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that had the President and the Government given the virus the attention it needed through some of these measures being currently put in place, the Ebola menace could not have reached the current crisis proportion claiming the lives of both health workers and citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neyor, however, added that Liberians are currently in a huge boat with a big hole that threatens their survivability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated further that there is no plan to pass blame as to who caused the hole in the boat but all must work together until we are all safely at the port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neyor stated that Liberians must now join hands with the Task Force to combat against the Ebola virus and take &quot;all necessary precautionary measures so as to avoid the continuous spread of the epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will all work with the government to contain the epidemic but we know that what brought us to this national calamity is tantamount to a colossal failure of leadership in our country. Despite this knowledge, we are in a sinking boat with a huge hole in it threatening our survival. Let us not concentrate now on who caused the hole in the boat but first on bringing the boat safely to the port,&quot; the ex-NOCAL boss stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking on Friday, August 1, 2014 to reporters in Monrovia shortly after his company; Morweh Energy Group Incorporated donated a consignment of sanitary materials to several mosques, churches, and public places, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The items donated include buckets with faucets, chloride and tide soaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the beneficiaries were the Newport Street Mosque, Jubilee International Ministries, Old Road Wesleyan Church, and Concerned Intellectual Association (CIA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time the Morweh Energy boss has identified with the fight against the Ebola virus in Liberia. It can be recalled that recently, Mr. Neyor presented the amount of LD$250,000 to the Liberia National Red Cross Society (LNRCS) in collaboration with the Liberia Medical Students Association (LMSA) to purchase protective gears for health workers in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neyor noted that each death caused as a result of the Ebola virus is like a &quot;toll of the bell&quot; for each of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot ask for whom the bell tolls, because for each of the pain of infection or death on any of our fellow citizen is like a pain on each of us. And until we can bring this monster under control the bell of each death toll for us. We salute those at the forefront of confronting this deadly disease, the healthcare workers, many of whom have died and others infected. These healthcare professionals who risk their own wellbeing are the true heroes and heroines of the battle against Ebola. Let us pray for healing and restoration in our country,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Montserrado County senatorial aspirant has called on the National Task Force established to combat against the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia &quot;to assess the possibility of recommending&quot; the postponement of the ensuing Special Senatorial Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that recently President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf constituted a National Task Force to help fight the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Senatorial Election in Liberia is expected to take place on October 14, 2014 according to the National Elections Commission (NEC) and campaign activities will officially kick off on August 12, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Neyor, the Task Force should recommend to the Liberian Chief Executive an &quot;appropriate State of Emergency&quot; that will give the NEC a legal basis for the possible suspension of the Special Senatorial Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said political campaign involves large gathering and close interaction among people, noting that, &quot;the lives of our people are valuable and irreplaceable and cannot be downplayed for anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that activities that are counter to preventive measures should be put in place to contain the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are calling on the National Task Force established on Ebola to assess the possibility of recommending to the President an appropriate State of Emergency that would provide the NEC a legal basis for possible suspension of the October Special Senatorial Election. The lives of our people are valuable and cannot be downplayed for anything. As for elections, we will always have them when the time is right and situations are stable. It is our hope that the decisions of the Task Force are based on sound medical and public health practices and not the usual way this government has based its decisions,&quot; Mr. Neyor mentioned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has donated four vehicles to the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Internal Affairs in support of the ongoing fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDP Resident Representative to Liberia, Antonio Vigilante said the vehicles were previously procured for the government's decentralization program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Monday at the signing ceremony, Mr. Vigilante said due to the Ebola emergency situation, UNDP reached a decision to divert the vehicles in support of the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hopes that the vehicles would be used by the government for burial, contact tracing and other efforts of the government and partners in the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNDP boss said his institution will reorder different vehicles for the Ministry of Internal Affairs for its decentralization program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Vigilante also frowned on traditional practices which, he said, are becoming harmful to the fight against the Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tradition is generally associated with the positive concept, but not all traditions are good. Some traditions are very bad; some traditions are very harmful and today we are seeing the demonstration every day... &quot; Mr. Vigilante said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if the issues of harmful traditional practices are not addressed, reducing transmission and spread of the Ebola virus will be difficult for the government and partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Internal Affairs Minister Morris Dukuly said the vehicles arrived at a time when the government is desperately in need of vehicles and other support to deal with the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Dukuly said the Ministry of Health, in the last Taskforce meeting, stressed the need for 12 additional vehicles to be used for burial and other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lauded UNDP for its continuous support to Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Thomas Frieden insisted that his team would be able to prevent an American outbreak, and that looking after the doctor who caught Ebola in Liberia was an &quot;acceptable risk&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was speaking as many Americans voiced concern over the decision to transport Dr Kent Brantly to a specially-adapted hospital in Georgia - the first time anyone carrying the Ebola virus has entered the Americas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hospital in Georgia is next to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, which Dr Frieden heads. Appearing on television, Dr Frieden sought to calm rising panic about the potential for Ebola to spread across America. He told ABC's This Week: &quot;The plain truth is, we can stop Ebola. We know how to control it. The single most important thing we can do to protect Americans is to stop this disease at the source in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Frieden said he was sending 50 doctors and nurses to west Africa to help tackle the disease over the next month. More than 800 people have died during the outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Saturday, Dr Brantly, 33, was brought back to the US on a speciallyadapted plane. The plane was returning to Liberia to collect a second infected American. Nancy Writebol, who like Dr Brantly was working for a missionary organisation, fell ill while at a unit treating Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A doctor who treated Nigeria's first Ebola victim has himself contracted the deadly virus, raising fears that the seven-month-long epidemic in three west African nations could spread in the continent's most populous nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor was part of a team that attended to Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who collapsed on arrival at Lagos airport last month.

Officials said they had identified 70 people with whom Sawyer had been in contact, eight of whom had been transferred to isolation wards in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic has killed 887 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The three country's leaders held a regional crisis summit in Guinea's capital, Conakry, last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation said the outbreak was moving faster than efforts to control it, and warned that the more people were infected, the greater the risk of the virus evolving into deadlier mutations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Lagos have rapidly rolled out a series of preventive measures, including quarantining the hospital where Sawyer was treated, distributing protective clothing to health workers and screening airport and seaport passengers arriving from at-risk countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information about the virus has been widely broadcast on radio stations, and some traders have begun cashing in with the sale of hand sanitiser branded &quot;Ebola cleansing hand gels&quot;. In the downtown business district where Sawyer was treated, a handful of traders could be seen wearing face masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, health officials visited the church of the &quot;super-pastor&quot; TB Joshua, which attracts 50,000 worshippers weekly. &quot;We asked that the church leadership be aware of the important role they have to play in preventing Ebola from spreading,&quot; a member of the delegation told the Guardian. &quot;Also we warned that they do not hold 'healing sessions' as we are concerned Ebola sufferers might travel from outside the country to the church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to contain the disease were hampered in Liberia and Sierra Leone as faith healers and crowded churches sheltered Ebola victims whom they claimed to be able to cure. Both countries eventually made such action a crime punishable with jail terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passed on through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, surfaces and bush meat, Ebola has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment. It is contagious only once symptoms begin showing and can rapidly degenerate into external and internal bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The epidemic is already having an impact on Nigeria. A South Korean university banned three Nigerian students from attending a summit, and a Nigerian delegation attending a US-Africa summit is believed to have been screened on arrival in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, health workers and officials said they had been overwhelmed by the spiralling death toll amid a shortage of resources. The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontiers said there were critical gaps in tackling the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current response to the Ebola outbreak is entirely insufficient compared to the needs, and there needs to be greater mobilisation on the ground. MSF does not have a clear overview of the most affected areas and it is believed that people are still dying in their villages without access to medical care,&quot; the organisation said on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US said it was sending a team of 50 specialists to the region this week. The British Red Cross has launched an appeal to raise funds. The WHO has set up a $100m (&pound;60m) fund to boost a regional emergency response.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">So, We Liberians Are Disciplined? [column]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1153 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever I write on issues that relate to our behavior and attitude, I always use the plural of the personal pronoun, &quot;WE&quot;to indicate that I am part of the society and directly or indirectly or intentionally or unintentionally, or to even go further by commission or by omission contribute to some of the problems in society, and therefore, see it from a holistic point and not from the point of a few. Most often it is said that there are two ways of doing things; the generally acceptable way and the &quot;Liberian Way.&quot; In short, the feeling is that many of us always circumvent the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever one speaks of the Liberian way, such person is making reference to our failure as a people to follow laid down rules and regulations. We are even referred to as people who do not respect the simple thing of time factor. For this, it is said that if you want invite a Liberian to an occasion, always give one hour before the actual time for the start of the occasion because if such Liberian is invited at the actual time, the person would not be on time and therefore, it is advisable to always consider the factor of &quot;not being on time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding, today, the situation is quite different with the outbreak of the Ebola virus that has claimed the lives of more than 100 Liberians. Since the issuance of new measurers in the face of the outbreak of the disease, I have observed and continue to observe that Liberians, at this time, are following the rules. They are not exhibiting the usual &quot;Liberian way.&quot; From all indications, they are respecting the measures, especially the washing of hands at various places, without arguments. In other words, we are showing high degree of discipline; that is, we are showing to the world of being disciplined people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new measures as announced by President Sirleaf last Tuesday states that all non-essential staff to be determined by the Minister or Head of Agency, are to be placed on a 30-day compulsory leave and that all borders that are to remain opened are to be directly supervised and controlled by the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization whose duties it shall be, working with the assigned health authorities, to ensure strict adherence to announce preventive measures including preliminary testing for fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the measures directed that without exceptions, all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the Ministry of Education, and that all markets at border areas including Foya, Bo Waterside, and Ganta are hereby ordered closed until further notice. Also, as previously directed, video clubs and entertainment centers must have improved sanitation including facilities for the washing of hands prior to entering and exiting as well as to restrict opening hours, and the number of individuals permitted to enter those facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures also advised allcitizens to avoid public amusement and entertainment centers. Increase in prices of sanitation commodities used in this fight will be treated as an offense against the people of Liberia. The Ministry of Commerce is directed to enforce this order and that all such commodities including chlorine, soap, sanitizers, fliers and buckets are to be imported duty free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally, the president said several communities were being considered to be quarantined based upon recommendations from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and other relevant authorities. When these measures are instituted, only health care workers will be permitted to move in and out of those areas. Food and other medical supports will be provided to those communities and affected individuals. Government travels will be seriously restricted and limited to only those that are determined to be absolutely necessary and critical. The Vice President and a few cabinet ministers whose presence are absolutely necessary will attend the ensuing U.S./Africa Leadership Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprisingly; I say surprisingly, because of the way and manner we have been behaving when it comes to some national issues and respect for procedures. It is indeed unfortunate that we are showing a different attitude and behavior at a time pestilence has befallen the nation. Are we to only show that we are disciplined people during the time of a pernicious situation, like in the case of the deadly Ebola Outbreak? Many times, we flout rules and always try to bypass procedures for reasons best known to ourselves. Sometimes it is about work habit; at times, it is about fiscal discipline, and at times it is about traffic regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I speak of discipline in this context, not as a field of study, but as it relates to how we behave and act in the enforcement and implementations of rules and regulations. Discipline in the context, I am referring to speak of &quot;control gained by enforcing obedience or order, orderly or prescribed conduct or pattern of behavior, self-control, a rule or system of rules governing conduct or activity.&quot; And so when the adjective, &quot;disciplined&quot; is used to modify the noun people, it means people who show obedience and adhere to prescribed conduct and also respect a rule of system of rules governing conduct or activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many times, we are accused of not followingrules; rather, we are noted for breaking the rules and regulations in many spheres of life. To make a long matter short, &quot;disciplined people&quot; means people who show respect for rules, standard and regulation. Besides, it also denotes discipline in whatever one does or whatever one finds himself or herself to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the simple examples, as stated earlier, are work habit and adherence to traffic regulations. It is an open secret in our society today that some of our &quot;big boys&quot; the sobriquet for public officials and others in society always flout traffic regulations on grounds of emergency or being late for work. Even to form a queue at some business centers, including banking institutions, is also a problem, as we always fail to follow the rules and procedures of &quot;first-come-first served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howbeit, as we now show to the world that we are a disciplined people, in the wake of this pestilence that has befallen the nation, let us continue this; even, after the nation had succeeded in its campaign against the spread of this Ebola virus; we should not revert to business as usual. Never again, should we be seen as people who sidestep generally acceptable ways and manners of doing things, but do them the way they should be as stipulated; the Liberian way should be something of yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we together fight to curtail this deadly Ebola, I see a change in attitude and behavior which would help to develop this country and make us to be respected by others. We should not only wait for something like pernicious Ebola before showing ourselves as disciplined people, but should exhibit those virtues of being disciplined people in all what we do as a people and nation, no matter of our positions or status in society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">570 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION on the streets of Monrovia, The INQUIRER has observed that several businesses and most of the citizens are following the preventive measures announced by the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare (MOH&amp;SW).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEVERAL BUSINESS PLACES visited by The INQUIRER's team of reporters are in serious compliance with the various measures announced by the Ministry of health to contain the Ebola virus. The citizens themselves are preventing themselves against the virus as they carry sanitizers and other preventive materials in their bags or pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THESE MEASURES ACCORDING to Miatta Doe-Kamara, a businesswoman are intended to ensure that the deadly Ebola virus be wiped out of the country. Business institutions that are vigorously following the MOH's preventive measures include, The Inquirer Newspaper, Itter Pharmacy, Sale Saloon-Hair Dresser, SK Meat Shop, Lion Stationery, and Golden Jewelry. Others are Anatah Pharmacy, A-One Stationery, Blue Pharmacy, and Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Transport, Bah Meat Shop, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN AN INTERVIEW with Harris Sumo, he stated that the country has reached a stage where one has to be careful how they interact with others because he or she can not tell who has the deadly Ebola virus till they are very ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. SUMO POINTED out that Government of Liberia (GOL), and international partners will do their best but that the citizens have to put themselves in the position of saving their own lives by taking the preventive measures that were announced by MOH&amp;SW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE SAID, &quot;LIBERIANS must stop doubting and find means to save their own lives because the deadly Ebola virus is real; it has killed many Liberians and foreigners, and it is still killing, and the deadly Ebola virus is still in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ARE ENCOURAGED by the way Liberians are now seriously taking the Ebola virus situation in the country especially in Monrovia. What we have observed lately is that everyone is getting involved in the fight against the virus; people are now purchasing preventive materials for their homes, business places and offices. This is a good sign, something we all must continue to enable us kick out the deadly Ebola virus which is claiming the lives of our citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURING OUR VISIT at various business houses and offices in the city, it was very encouraging to see everyone taking the preventive measures to the letter. Let us keep up the fight bearing in mind that this situation is no longer government alone issue but all Liberians as well as those residing in the territorial borders of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE THE PREVENTIVE measures are being taken, we also call on those in charge of funds or materials to fight the Ebola virus to ensure that those materials or money allotted are used for the intended purpose. We demand transparency and accountability in the process as we all strive to ensure that Ebola is eradicated from our country. It is no doubt that we trust those heading the campaign but we are sending this caveat to avoid any temptation because the Ebola issue is very serious and must not be compromised for personal aggrandizement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, WE ARE pleased with the level of compliance on the part of the citizens in preventing themselves against the deadly Ebola virus. We are again pleading with all Liberians as well as foreign nationals in the country to keep up the compliance. Remember That Prevention Is Better Than Cure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">336 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the fight against the deadly EBOLA virus in Liberia, Western Cluster Limited (WCL) on Friday donated a consignment of sanitary materials -chloride (bleach) and hand washing buckets to the people of Bomi County, one of the two counties in Western Liberia where the company operates iron ore concessions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bomi is also among counties where the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare recently reported confirmed cases of the virus which resulted into deaths of some citizens including the county's main hospital's Chief Administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the presentation ceremony at the company's Monrovia Office, WCL's Executive Director, Atul Mittal, said the donation of the sanitary materials to the county is in line with the company's policy to always work with communities within its concession areas during good and challenging periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mittal noted that because of the EBOLA situation in Liberia, Bomi County is going through challenging moment and advised residents to act safe and carry out the necessary hygienic methods as surest ways of preventing the deadly virus, adding, &quot;The good health of the Liberian people is our main concern&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the donation, Bomi County Superintendent, Samuel F. Brown accompanied by Senator Sando Dazoe Johnson, commended WCL for always identifying with the people of Bomi. He said, &quot;Western Cluster has always been a true partner to our county. The company has done a lot for Bomi including not missing out on its annual social development funds contributions; supported the Bomi County Community College through educational and learning materials; conducted free medical services where more than 5000 persons benefited; constructed bridges; rehabilitated roads among others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Senator Johnson commended the company and indicated: &quot;anyone who identifies with people during times of problems is a real friend and partner&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Johnson said the donation by Western Cluster Limited is timely and assured the materials will be distributed to the intended recipients.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In compliance with the Government of Liberia's mandate as directed by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in her nationwide address, many public and private buildings remain closed on Friday to ensure that their respective offices are sanitized as part of the fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has spread to West Africa mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia with the death tolls of at least 729, the World Health Organization has said. The virus has killed dozens of health workers in Liberia some of whom were Medical Doctors and Government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf recently declared last Friday a Non-working day for all Liberians including those working in the public and private sectors and the day was observed by Liberians in their numbers with the sanitization of their various offices and homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the citizens used sanitizers, faucet buckets, detergents and chlorines to clean their offices and reporters observed for the first time that Liberians came together in the fight against the Ebola virus. Also as announced by the Ministry of Justice, commercial drivers are complying with the mandate by the Liberia National Police by carrying the minimum numbers of passengers in their respective vehicles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporters also observed that most government and public institutions have been complying with the instructions given by President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf in the sanitization of facilities. At the same time, Liberians are also following the preventive measures announced by the Ministry of Health recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, several public and private institutions visited by The INQUIRER's reporter observed that several institutions have taken the preventive measures by chlorinating their offices to ensure that the Ebola epidemic is eradicated in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the institutions that have taken the preventive measures include, the Liberia National Red Cross Society, Ministry of Labor, GSA, Ecobank, NOCAL, National Port Authority (NPA) and Liberia Petroleum Company (LPRC) among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with some of those who chlorinated their institutions, an employee of LNRCS, Christopher O. Johnson said the country has reached a stage where every Liberian has to take precaution in ensuring that their families and the entire country is Ebola free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson said, &quot;The date August 1, that was declared as a non-working day to be observed as disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities by President Sirleaf, was not set aside as a day for merry-making but to save the country from the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that some Liberians who doubt the existence of the Ebola should stop and take preventive measures because the Ebola epidemic is very terrible and dangerous, and is real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson said, &quot;The sensitizations that are going on in the country will assist in eradicating the deadly Ebola virus in the country, and they are asking every Liberian to keep up with the preventive measures that have been carried on by them (citizens) in the country,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the intensification of the use of the preventive measures as announced by the Ministry of Health, there has been no report of any new case of the virus though some of those affected by the Ebola virus have been dying from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Liberian women have begun a National Prayer against the Ebola virus. The women under the banner of WANET and other Liberian women have been praying fervently for their nation that has just emerged from nearly 14 years of devastating civil conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in the wake of the Ebola viral disease outbreak confirmed in three of four member States of the Mano River Union (MRU), leaders of the sub-regional organization have committed themselves to taking stringent measures aimed at eradicating the deadly disease that has already claimed the lives of over 700 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an extraordinary summit of Heads of State and Government of the MRU held in the Guinean capital, Conakry on Friday, the leaders agreed in a Joint Declaration, to among other things, impose a cross-border isolation zone at the epicenter of the outbreak, considered the world's worst-ever outbreak of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have agreed to take important and extraordinary actions at the inter country level to focus on cross-border regions that have more than 70 percent of the epidemic,&quot; said Ambassador Dr. Kaba Hadja Saran Daraba, Secretary General of the MRU, who read the Joint Declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These areas will be isolated by police and the military. The people in these areas being isolated will be provided with material support,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;The health care services in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing and contact tracing to be done effectively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRU Secretary General, who did not specifically outline the exact area to be part of the isolation zone, but the epicenter of the outbreak has a diameter of almost 300 kilometers (185 miles), spreading from Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone to Macenta in southern Guinea, and taking in most of Liberia's extreme northern forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The healthcare services in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing and contact tracing to be carried out effectively,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRU leaders also agreed to provide health personnel incentives, treatment and protection so they could come back to work. &quot;We will ensure the security and safety of all national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola,&quot; the leaders assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering Ebola as an international problem that requires an international response, the MRU leaders committed themselves to doing their part to bring the Ebola outbreak to an end as soon as possible. However, they urged the International Community to support Member States build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management and laboratory capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We the Heads of State want to assure the international community that the disease is not being exported,&quot; the Joint Declaration stated, assuring the International Community that the three countries have instituted measures at international ports of entry/exit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRU leaders committed themselves to mobilize private and public sectors to work in synergy and increase sensitization efforts to enable communities to understand the Ebola disease for effective and efficient eradication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They further pledged to strengthen the surveillance of cross border movement through information sharing on screening of passengers, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the summit, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Margaret Chan termed the first outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa as &quot;unprecedented&quot;, accompanied by unprecedented challenges, which are extraordinary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Providing the MRU leaders with some frank assessment of the situation, Dr. Chan revealed that the outbreak was &quot;moving faster than efforts of control it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socio-economic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries,&quot; Dr. Chan said. She described the outbreak as &quot;by far the largest ever in the nearly four decade history of this disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is taking place in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders, and it has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel, contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks,&quot; she told the summit. &quot;Cases are occurring in rural areas which are difficult to access, but also in densely populated capital cities. This meeting must mark a turning point in the outbreak response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the WHO Director General said, &quot;the outbreak is affecting a large number of doctors, nurses and other health care workers, one of the most essential resources for containing an outbreak,&quot; adding, &quot;These tragic infections and deaths significantly erode response capacity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stressed that the situation in West Africa is of international concern and must receive urgent priority for decisive action at national and international level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRU leaders used the summit to launch a US$100 million (<SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>75 million) action plan that will see several hundred more personnel deployed in the affected countries to supplement overstretched treatment facilities. Of greatest need are clinical doctors and nurses, epidemiologists, social mobilization experts, logisticians and data managers, among others to battle the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRU leader mandated President Alpha Conde of Guinea, who is current Chairman of the sub-regional organization, to convey the message of the Union related to Ebola to the U.S. -Africa Leaders Summit in Washington later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two leaders, Presidents Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Ernest Bai Koroma will remain in their respective countries to coordinate individual National Action Plans against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the MRU leaders signed for their respective countries except for C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire who was represented by the Health Minister Dr. Raymonde Goudou Coffie.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">378 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists in the United States have revealed that the first Ebola vaccine could be available in two to six years, but warned that funding problem could undermine very important clinical tests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say four new drugs are in the developmental stages in labs across the U.S. with trials involving monkeys yielding positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, scientists indicated that it is too early for people to be cited about the development. Researchers warned that if funding is not available it could threaten and undermine the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Thomas Geisbert of the University of Texas disclosed that he believes a vaccine will be approved in the next two to six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest Ebola outbreak sweeping through West Africa is the worst on record since the disease was discovered in Zaire in 1976</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Geisbert, whose lab is working on some of the drugs, said: 'There are at least four vaccines that can protect against Ebola (in monkeys).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes a vaccine will be available from two to six years. But they cannot go to the next level of their research because the exercise is solely depended on financial support for the small companies that develop these vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Human studies are expensive and require a lot of government dollars. 'With Ebola, there's a small global market - there's not a big incentive for a large pharmaceutical company to make an Ebola vaccine, so it's going to require government funding.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Geisbert, who has studied the Ebola virus since 1988, told Scientific American Magazine, there are three to five preventative vaccines that look promising, having yielded positive results when tested on monkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said many of the drugs in development are at the stage where research teams are trying to get the funds to carry out human studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;The hang-up point with these vaccines is the phase I trials in humans. That's where scientists get frustrated because we know these vaccines protect animals and we don't quite understand the regulatory process of why things can't move faster. I can't give you an answer as to why it's taking so long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus that has left West Africa berserk is the worst recorded, since the disease was discovered four decades ago (in 1976). So far, more than 670 people have died, while another 1,200 have been infected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two American citizens infested with the deadly Ebola virus have been flown home on a private aircraft. Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were transported to the United States Friday via a specially equipped aircraft, the U.S. State Department said at the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the United States did not identify the Americans who were flown home, however, it has been presumed that Dr. Brantly and Writebol are those known to have been flown out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, Emory University Hospital announced last Thursday that one patient would be treated at a high security ward at Emory University in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This decision by the U.S. government to conduct the medical evacuation has sparked fear not only amongst some Americans, but also among the Liberian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, aid agencies based in the United States announced the evacuation of some nonessential staff from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important that we do not let fear of the unfamiliar overtake our reasoned approach to any infectious disease control,&quot; Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is involved with the evacuation, is quoted by Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate interview, she said, &quot;If a patient is being transported, it will be on a private, contracted jet equipped to manage an ill patient and do the proper infection control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said these jets handle patients with an illness that can be transmitted through the air which is not the case with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remember, Ebola is not transmitted through the air as so many other deadly diseases are. Also, Ebola can only be transmitted by someone who shows signs of illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We continue to work with WHO and other federal departments to protect the health of Americans here and abroad,&quot; she said in the email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this is the first time an Ebola patient has been brought to the U.S., the CDC has handled cases involving similarly lethal or virulent diseases, such as Marburg virus and Lassa fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization and presidents of the West African countries affected by the Ebola outbreak launched a joint $100 million Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan on Friday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">487 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Liberia, Karin Landgren, has welcomed the Government of Liberia's strategic plan for an accelerated response to the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The comprehensive response plan launched yesterday President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is critical to the fight against Ebola in Liberia; with the World Health Organization at the forefront, the UN family in Liberia will continue to devote considerable resources towards response and prevention in line with the Government-led effort,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone has been unprecedented in scope and scale. More than 1,200 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola have been recorded in the three countries and well over half of the people infected have died. The numbers of new cases and deaths continue to accelerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, an average of almost 14 new cases a day were recorded in the last week of July, bringing the total number of confirmed, suspected and probable cases to over 350 in seven of the country's 15 counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the nine weeks since a second wave of Ebola hit Liberia in late May, authorities have recorded 170 deaths due to confirmed or probable Ebola,&quot; the SRSG said. &quot;There are likely many other cases that go unreported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government's comprehensive plan requires $20.9 million so that the authorities, working with the UN, NGOs and other partners, can continue scaling up the response, which includes case management, laboratory testing, infection control, psychosocial support and massive outreach to educate the public and change behaviors that spread the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further generous funding is needed to roll back the disease, which is overwhelming isolation centers and has too frequently claimed the lives of courageous healthcare workers at the forefront of the response to Ebola,&quot; Landgren said. In Liberia, 45 health workers have been infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enhanced efforts to ensure healthcare workers' safety are among several measures taken by the Government to combat the disease. On 27 July, the Government announced the closure of most border crossings and Ebola controls at the major open border points, restrictions on public gatherings, and standing orders for security forces to enforce the new measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other measures include the closure of all schools, internal movement restrictions and 30-day compulsory leave for all non-essential government employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will remain deeply engaged in securing the best possible UN support to this unpredictable situation which has placed a massive burden on Liberia's limited capacity to respond,&quot; Landgren said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN has helped to set up isolation units to manage cases. We provide support for surveillance and contact tracing, medical expertise, and material resources like vehicles, chlorine, and Ebola kits,&quot; the UN envoy stressed. Thirty-five UN workers are providing logistical support to the response.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">506 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh, internationally renowned humanitarian, economist and Presidential Candidate in the 2011 Elections, is offering LD10 million worth of his professional services free-of-charge to the Ebola Task Force to help in the national drive to stop the Ebola virus from being in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh, a former Minister of Planning and Economic Affairs, is saying that he is prepared to help with his professional services directed at increasing the awareness of the people, the participation of the people in the planning and, most importantly, the participation of the people in the implementation of the People's Plan to end the presence of the Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh, in his statement to the media over the weekend, is reminding the people of Liberia how they cooperated well with his NGO, Susukuu, in its School-for-Guns and Street-to-School Programs in which over 80 per cent of the combatants were disarmed, given free health care, sent to school and training for jobs and set up in business while thousands of children, potential combatants, were taken from the poorest communities and placed in schools and their parents and guardians were set up in business as ways of not only ending war but preventing war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh is offering his services to use the successful Susukku experience in conscientizing and mobilizing the people of Liberia and friends of Liberia to help in the great patriotic struggle to end the presence of Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Dr. Tipoteh has begun some work to stop Ebola by using the media waves, mainly the radio to reach the people throughout Liberia, Liberians abroad and friends of Liberia to raise awareness about the Ebola virus being in Liberia, killing people and spreading but there is something that the people, working individually and collectively, can do to end the presence of the Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on what the National Health Authorities are saying, Dr. Tipoteh is calling on all Liberians and foreign residents in Liberia to do the right thing by realizing that Ebola is killing people in Liberia but it can be stopped by people telling the nearest health worker about any person who has high fever, any person who is vomiting with red-looking eyes and any person who has strange marks on his or her skin that health workers call rash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tipoteh is urging the people to report the Ebola signs fast so that the people with the signs of the sickness can be protected to prevent them from dying and to protect other people from catching the signs of the sickness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Tipoteh, the Health Authorities are also stressing on people being clean, especially by washing hands with soap, not making physical contact with people who have the signs of the disease, not shaking hands, hugging, kissing and staying away from people who die from the Ebola virus because here are special protected health workers who will take care of the burying of the people who die from Ebola so that the disease will not spread and then it will come to an end in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare says there is no chemical or equipment in Liberia for the cremation of Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ministry of Health and relevant agencies are also to consider the cremation of all victims of the deadly Ebola virus. This measure is intended to avoid tampering with the dead and contaminating water sources,&quot; President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf said in a nationwide address Wednesday, July 30, 2014.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, speaking at the Ministry of Information regular press briefing in Monrovia, Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah said the issue of cremation is not the culture and practice of the people of Liberia and therefore it was not possible to be carried out in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The burial of people in swamps that we are doing now; we're putting people in body bags and it is not in any way scientifically proven to contaminate the soil... &quot; Minister Nyenswah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister told community members not to be frightened by the burial of Ebola victims in various cemeteries around the country as the act had no effect on the soil or water sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the burial process which is the cultural and best practice in Liberia doesn't pose any risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Johnson Sirleaf announced that cremation of Ebola victims is part of several measures aimed at fighting the Ebola disease in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains unclear whether the President previously consulted health authorities about the possibility of cremation of bodies before the pronouncement was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also indicated that several communities suspected of the virus will be quarantined based upon recommendations from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and other relevant authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When these measures are instituted, only health care workers will be permitted to move in and out of those areas. Food and other medical support will be provided to those communities and affected individuals,&quot; the Liberian leader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare said it would require US$21,430,990 million to fully implement the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said of the total amount, the Ministry has received the total of US$6,185,830 million in pledges from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Government of Liberia and other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said the plan seeks to reduce the death rate caused by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE rapidly spreading, deadly ebola outbreak in Africa is a cause for grave concern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- although health officials stress that Britons need not worry unduly. It does, however, highlight how important it is to take precautions when visiting countries where there is a possibility of contracting dis- eases unheard of at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, PROFESSOR LARRY GOOD&shy;YER, head of the Leicester School of Pharmacy at De Montfort University and deputy chairman of the British Global and Travel Health Association, explains how to avoid everything from traveller s tummy, to something more serious.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q The average traveller isn t really at risk from ebola, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Ebola is an extremely serious disease but the vast majority of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">travellers aren t at risk. Ebola seems to be a problem predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Some animals there appear to carry the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outbreaks in humans probably occur as a result of eating the meat from those wild animals or handling carcasses that harbour the virus. Ebola is then passed from person to person through direct contact with bodily fluids, either through intimate contact,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">caring for someone with the condition, or from being in an area where there is an outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q I m travelling in an area where cases have been reported. How do I stay safe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quarantine arrangements are in place in those areas affected and must be obeyed. As a precaution, avoid eating  bush meats  of any wild animals such as fruit bats or mon-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">keys. Other than that, follow the same advice we always give to reduce the risk of general illness and stomach upsets. Practise good hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water and regularly use a sanitising hand gel, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you do travel to Africa and dev- elop a fever, flu-like symptoms, feel generally ill or your temperature is raised, seek medical advice for a vari- ety of reasons, including malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Is sitting next to someone enough to catch ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Even if you were sitting near someone on a plane who was infected, you d still need to come into direct contact with their bodily fluids to contract the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q If I suspect someone is unwell on a plane, what should I do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A It could be down to many ail- ments including flu, a stomach upset, or even a hangover. If some- one was critically ill they wouldn t be allowed on a plane, and if they fell ill on board, the pilot would seek advice. It would be irresponsible of passengers to cause panic because someone appeared unwell, but you could discreetly alert the cabin crew of your concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q If I get ill on holiday, might I be stopped from travelling home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A If you had ebola you wouldn t be allowed to fly home - you d be in quarantine and receiving emergency treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So I don t need to worry about ebola. But the family is off on holiday in a fortnight and we haven t really thought about vaccination - what should we do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A It s important you have any required vaccinations six weeks in advance of your trip. If it s only two weeks, or less, until your holi- day, go to your GP or local travel clinic immediately to be vacci- nated. They ll tell you what you need for the country you are visiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So once we re vaccinated, we don t need to worry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A It s important to be vigilant about your health when travel-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ling. For example, if you re going to an area where malaria is prevalent, you may need to take medication to protect yourself from it. Take steps also to avoid being bitten by mosqui- toes, as this is how malaria is con- tracted. Use a bug spray and sleep with nets over your bed. Read up on the symptoms so you know if you develop any. There are lots of com- mon ailments you can t be vaccinated against but that can be debilitating, such as traveller s tummy, so being prepared is important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Are there medicines or a first-aid kit that every family should take when going abroad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Stock a medical kit with simple items for cuts, grazes and sprains, and ensure you have anti- septic cream, antihistamines and sterile dressings for mosquito bites. Also, carry painkillers, anti-inflam- matories and loperamide to help stop diarrhoea. Always pack sachets of rehydration salts as dehydration can be dangerous after a stomach upset or sickness. If you re going on an adventure holiday, you might</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">need specific medicines, such as drugs for altitude sickness. I advise against buying medicines while in Africa - even paracetamol - because of the huge number of counterfeit products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What exactly is traveller s tummy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A A form of E.coli called entero- toxigenic escherichia coli is the most common cause, and symptoms include diarrhoea, cramps and sometimes fever and nausea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food that s not cooked thoroughly, isn t hot enough or has been sitting on a buffet for a long time and has flies on it is the main cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can drinking a little of the local water help prevent me from catching traveller s tummy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A To get any kind of resistance takes months, if not a year. Although food is more risky than water when it comes to bugs, I would still always drink bottled water or water that has been boiled. In Africa, I would boil and treat water with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dissolvable chemical tablet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can I take something before travelling to stop tummy bugs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A There are a number of pro- biotics and prebiotics on the market and some may decrease the risk of tummy troubles by up to 70 per cent. But you re more likely to eventually succumb to traveller s tummy in certain countries, and the longer you re away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY STEPHEN ADAMS AND MARTYN HALLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN has just two  ebola-proof  hospital beds, The Mail on Sunday has learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official guidance states that patients with the highly infectious disease - which has no vaccine, no cure and kills up to 90 per cent of victims - should be treated in specially built units that are biologically secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there is only one operational High Secure Infectious Diseases Unit (HSIDU) in the UK, at the Royal Free Hospital in London. It has two beds. A second, at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, is  being redeveloped  according to NHS England.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Britain have more than two ebola patients at any one time, they will have to be treated in less secure hospital side rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Stephen Mepham, an infectious diseases consultant at the Royal Free, said there would be  no other option  but to treat ebola patients in standard isolation rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said:  We think it is highly unlikely, but if we had more than two patients we would have to treat them in our normal isolation facilities. They are not to the same standard but we are confident we could prevent spread. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HSIDU, he said, had an array of equipment to ensure a patient did not pass on the killer virus, including air-lock doors and  negative pressure  air flow to make sure nothing escapes from the unit. The patient is kept in a sealed plastic tent, with arm mouldings so doctors and nurses can treat them without any physical contact. The tent is burnt after use in dedicated incinerators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guidance issued by the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Executive in 2012 states that patients with confirmed viral haemorrhagic fever - of which ebola is the most deadly type -  should be managed in an HSIDU  to  eliminate or minimise the risk of transmission to health care workers . It warns that it can  spread readily within a hospital setting ,  has a high case-fatality rate , and  is difficult to recognise and detect rapidly .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NHS England spokesman said it was  hypothetical  to talk about Britain having more ebola cases than HSIDU beds, as there are no confirmed cases in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the situation can change rapidly. American charity volunteers Dr Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 60, have contracted the virus in Liberia. Dr Brantly arrived back in the US yesterday to be treated at a special secure unit in Atlanta, Georgia. For now, Ms Writebol remains in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain, like the US, has dozens of volunteers on the ebola frontline in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the latest figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO), there have been 729 deaths from 1,329 confirmed cases of ebola in this year s epidemic, the largest number ever known. On Friday, WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said ebola was spreading  faster than our efforts to control it .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office refused to confirm if British citizens who contract the virus abroad would be flown back for treatment, saying only:  Procedures are in place but we are not going to speculate on what we would do in any individual case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With up to 10,000 passengers flying into UK airports every week on 30 direct flights from West Africa, Keith Vaz, the Labour MP and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the country should not wait for its  first taste of ebola  before taking tough action. He wants ministers to consider introducing fever-screening cameras at UK airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, which has fewer direct flights from the region than the UK, introduced infra-red thermal imaging cameras at two major airports in April, in an early response to the ebola threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria said they would be introducing temperature screening at airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However critics say the cameras pick up lots of  false positives  - including people with minor illnesses and those who are hot after a dash through the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Vaz said:  As far as I m concerned any measures - including additional screening - which are felt necessary to reassure the public should be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prevention is always better than cure: we don t want to have our first taste of ebola before taking action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for NHS England said:  There are currently no known cases of ebola in the UK, but we are confident that we have robust arrangements in place should that situation change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Royal Free can routinely manage two ebola patients. There are arrangements to increase this capacity quickly should this be required. The new HSIDU at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle is being redeveloped, but the infectious diseases unit remains open and ready to play a role. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY ANDREW MALONE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1623 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the sun beating down on the strange and exotic-looking meats on sale some dripping blood, some heavily smoked and impossible to identify the sights and sounds at this London market are straight out of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skinned goat carcasses dangle overhead, blackened cow heads and lamb brains are lined up in trays, while baskets tucked in darker corners brim with yellowing strips of cured flesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, women hawk spices, cassava and yams, as men in shacks offer cheap airline tickets to Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon, as well as cash transfers back to family members still living on the continent. At Lagos restaurant, just past Monni Matters' foreign exchange and the God Is Good Hair Salon', there is nothing fancy about the cheap seats and chipped tables but what's on the menu is a taste of home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At &pound;5 a plate, dishes include Nkwobi, a traditional meal of spiced cow feet and assorted meat and fish' with pounded yam, through to giant African snails, served as part of a designer stew' with, again, unnamed assorted meats'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene at Ridley Road in Dalston, East London, an area with a large African community is replicated at similar markets in many British towns and cities, and is part of the daily ebb and flow of people and goods between the African continent and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, with flights from West Africa taking fewer than eight hours, traders boast that much of their produce is fresh' from the country of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet for all the sunshine, bustle and sound of African voices, the butchers here were oddly tense this week, not to mention strangely reluctant to discuss certain choice cuts of meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason? Ridley Road has been identified as a hub for the secret market in bush meat' the flesh of exotic animals such as chimpanzee, monkey, porcupine, fruit bats and even giraffe, slaughtered in the African bush and smuggled into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that a staggering 7,500 tonnes of illegal meat enters Britain each year, the bulk of which is bush meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade has hitherto been defended on cultural grounds, as little different to Britons eating rabbit or venison. But it is now at the centre of a terrifying health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For we are in the midst of the worst outbreak in history of the deadly Ebola virus and bush meat is one of the primary sources of the disease's transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spread through the blood and body fluids of infected people and animals, Ebola's latest outbreak began in February in Guinea and has so far claimed more than 700 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no cure, there are growing fears that the movement of people and goods between Africa and Europe will make it all too easy for Ebola to wreak death and havoc around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the underground trade in bush meat may be the channel by which the UK is most vulnerable to an Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having lived in Africa and travelled the continent for 20 years, I have been offered everything from elephant meat to monkey and lion steaks, and the markets selling this bush meat are still flourishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the appetite for such delicacies has also spread dramatically from Africa, to Europe and the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason this gives such cause for concern is that ever since the Ebola virus was discovered, deep in the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976, scientists have warned it can pass from animals to humans who prepare or eat infected meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1996 outbreak in Gabon was caused when local people ate the fresh body of a dead chimpanzee they found in the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disturbingly, one of the hosts of the disease in the latest outbreak is the forest fruit bat, sold as bush meat all over West Africa and made into a popular spicy stew called kedjenou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bats are also hunted and eaten by some large animals such as baboons, which, again, are sold as part of the vast global trade in bush meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five previous outbreaks have been linked to the handling of meat from gorillas, chimps and duikers (a small antelope) for the bush meat business and all these animals have been found for sale in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heathrow baggage handlers frequently complain about foul-smelling packages, some seeping blood, as couriers arrive with their goods from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their tip-offs present no significant hindrance to the trade, as the UK's over-stretched customs officers focus their resources on drugs and terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meat is also brought into the country through the Channel Tunnel after being flown to Paris, a major hub for flights from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us to back to the bustle of Ridley Road. Here, the risk posed to public health from bush meat comes as no surprise to Dr Yunes Teinaz, a former environment health official for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, he has been warning that the bush meat trade is a time-bomb owing to the sheer size of the business and the fact that the meat is sold without any of the safety tests demanded by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has, as a result, been targeted for revenge attacks by the gangs controlling the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm horrified and disappointed by what has been allowed to go on,' he told me. I warned about this many years ago, but local authorities are still not taking any action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meat is sold everywhere. It's smuggled in vast quantities. It's supplied all around Britain. It poses a potentially huge risk to public health, yet we are doing nothing to tackle it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was two years ago that a BBC programme revealed that giant rats smuggled from Africa were among the items on sale at Ridley Road market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year earlier, trading standards officials testing meat samples, believed to be seized from vendors in the Midlands, realised they were handling chimpanzee flesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Teinaz believes there should be a full government inquiry into the scale of the scandal, scoffing at claims by health inspectors that they check African markets regularly to ensure there is no bush meat being sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can't just walk up as a white person and ask to buy bush meat,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You need to be an African and speak the language, and then it's easy. You can get monkey heads, animal blood used in rituals all smuggled in without any health checks. You can place orders at these African markets and they will deliver to your home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is very big business and people are smart they will think you are an inspector or the police if you just start asking around.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this explains the reaction when, during a shopping expedition to Ridley Road this week, I asked for special meat' at a number of stalls. The so-called code' did not work: one Ghanaian shopkeeper became angry and agitated, turning his back and telling me to go away because we only sell cassava here', referring to the starchy vegetable that's a staple of tropical diets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, for all the reticence and secrecy, everyone knows what goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman running a stall selling wigs, who came to London from Nigeria 20 years ago, confirmed that many of her fellow Africans buy bush meat from the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I often get a craving for it,' she admitted. You used to get it everywhere here, but it's gone underground now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't have a problem with people eating it you eat deer and rabbits and other creatures.' This trader told me, however, that she would no longer buy bush meat because of the Ebola terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's always been my only objection on health grounds,' she said. I wouldn't risk it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all share her caution. One shopkeeper, outside a stall named two years ago as a supplier of bush meat, insisted that there was nothing wrong with it though he swore he did not sell such products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody knows where you can get it,' he told me. Bush meat is like drugs you can get it everywhere if you know the right people, but you won't see it openly on sale. It's word of mouth and under-the-counter deals.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, that is the modus operandi of one man involved in the trade. This Nigerian butcher agreed to meet me in a cafe away from the market, and made a spirited, if dangerously ignorant, defence of his business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of people believe bush meat is magical,' he told me. But meat is meat. People in Britain are only against it because nobody pays any taxes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting he did not eat bush meat himself, he told me that hunting and eating wild animals was part of his culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We grew up doing it it was normal,' he said. That's why people think it's normal here to eat their food from home, just like Brits want baked beans or ketchup when they live abroad.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for attempts to end the trade at its source, they seem doomed for a number of reasons, even despite the threat posed by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With countries such as Liberia, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone trying to introduce local bans on bush meat to halt the spread of the virus, people are simply refusing to stop the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush meat is, in fact, booming in popularity among Africans, encouraged by proclamations by some of their leaders to reject western ways. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there have even been calls from nationalists for foreign cuisine to be replaced with typically African' dishes such as chimpanzee, served as les cousins' to human diners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With bush meat costing more than chicken or beef in some African cities, it has also become a status symbol for richer Africans, many of whom believe the attributes of the animals they eat will pass to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of animals being killed is staggering, with conservation groups warning that millions of tonnes of meat are being taken from Africa's forests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will not stop it [the trade] I just think it's futile,' said Bob Swanepoel, a virologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all it needs is a small piece of infected meat, perhaps brought in the suitcase of a guest visiting from the continent, to pass Ebola into the community here and the nightmare could start.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEARS that the deadly Ebola virus could hit Britain were growing last night after a number of athletes from Sierra Leone appeared to be missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone's men's and women's 4x400m relay teams mysteriously withdrew from first round heats at the Commonwealth Games last night. Organisers were given no explanation for the no-shows. It is the fourth event the country's athletes have entered but failed to start.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unisa Deen Kargbo, chef de mission of the Sierra Leone team, said he was investigating his team's non-appearance and hoped there was an explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was at Hampden Park expecting to see the boys and girls in the relay,' he said last night. I don't know where they are. They are supposed to be with their coaches. I am going back to the village to find out what has happened and why they did not compete.' He said no other athletes had been showing signs of illness and all had said they would take part in their events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged last night that a Sierra Leone athlete disappeared from the athletes' village in Glasgow after two of his teammates were held in quarantine for displaying symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mountain bike champion Mohamed Tholley, 25, vanished from the Glasgow 2014 athletes' village more than a week ago - leaving his passport behind. It is understood he was worried about his friend and teammate Moses Sesay, who was tested for the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old cyclist was put in isolation in hospital for four days after developing a fever and symptoms similar to the virus. Table tennis player Samuel Morris, 34, also spent four days in isolation. Both were given the all-clear after exhaustive tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sesay said he believes Mr Tholley left the athletes' complex without even competing because he was afraid of the virus and did not want to return to his homeland. He said that many of the 26 Sierra Leone athletes in Scotland share his missing friend's fears. All of us are scared about returning,' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kargbo said it is possible Mr Tholley vanished because he is too afraid to go back to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE spread of the deadly Ebola virus is out of control and the effects could be catastrophic', the World Health Organisation said last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of the disease, the worst since it was discovered in the mid-1970s, has so far caused 729 deaths in four different countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment its spread is contained to West Africa, but there are growing fears that it could hit the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night WHO director-general Margaret Chan said: This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives, severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a meeting in Guinea's capital Conakry, she told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast that the virus could be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said that cultural practices such as traditional burials were a significant cause of its spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British authorities are currently on high alert, and have put measures in place to ensure that all passengers displaying symptoms are prevented from boarding flights to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who appears ill on arrival into Britain will be held at immigration before being quarantined in highly secure isolation units. However, because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday Mrs Chan revealed that the outbreak has now caused 1,323 recorded cases of the disease overall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned that governments may need to restrict population movements and public gatherings, and use the police and civil defence forces to guarantee the security of response teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the WHO chief went on to point out that more than 60 medical workers have died, a loss which has hampered efforts to tackle the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Americans working for aid group Samaritan's Purse who contracted the disease in Liberia are in a serious condition and are being medically evacuated, the organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the outbreak has prompted some international organisations to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Peace Corps has said it was withdrawing 340 volunteers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Samaritan's Purse said on Friday it would complete the evacuation of its 60 international staff from Liberia over the weekend and WaterAid said on Friday it was suspending its operations there as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone yesterday declared a public health emergency with the government ordering house-to-house searches by troops to seek out infected patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far Liberia has closed all schools and some government departments as well as looking at the possibility of quarantining affected communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the leader of Guinea's Ebola taskforce said his country would not be following these moves. Some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder,' Aboubacar Sidiki Diakia said, citing in particular the closure of schools. He added: When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO will convene an emergency committee on August 6 to decide if the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to recommend measures to tackle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Chan has promised to take personal responsibility for coordinating international response efforts and mobilising the support needed to fight the virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE health chief leading the fight against the Ebola outbreak in west Africa warned yesterday that it was spiralling out of control toward a &quot;catastrophic&quot; epidemic that could engulf the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Margaret Chan, director general of the World Heath Organisation, said the response to the disease had been &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; and that it was &quot;moving faster than our efforts to control it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her stark warning was made to the leaders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as they held an emergency summit to discuss how to curb the crisis, which has now claimed at least 729 lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socio-economic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries,&quot; Dr Chan said, according to a transcript from the summit in Conakry, the Guinean capital. &quot;This meeting must mark a turning point in the outbreak response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two US aid workers infected with Ebola, believed to be Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, a missionary, are due to arrive in America to receive treatment in high-security intensive care wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A small private jet, equipped with a portable isolation tent, has been dispatched to Liberia to collect the pair, who are believed to be in a &quot;stable but grave&quot; condition. Officials have not specified when they expect the jet to return, but it will be the first time an Ebola sufferer has been treated in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Chan's comments were made amid signs of growing panic in the affected nations, where the fight against the disease has been hampered by a lack of public health education and a widespread belief that it is caused by witchcraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, said there was fear and panic across the country, adding: &quot;There are dead bodies all over the place and they now know that it's real. They know that it's deadly and they are now beginning to respond.&quot; She said some Liberians were keeping infected patients at home or taking them to traditional healers, fearing wrongly that bringing them to the specialist treatment clinics would increase their chances of catching the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday, Sierra Leone ordered its security forces to take health officials on house-to-house searches to find anyone suspected of harbouring an Ebola sufferer, despite fears that such a robust approach could alienate the public. In a further sign of disagreement over how to respond to the outbreak, the leader of the Ebola task force in Guinea said that moves by neighbouring Liberia to shut all schools to contain the disease could prove counterproductive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse,&quot; said Aboubacar Sidiki Diakita. &quot;Currently, some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Randy Schoepp, chief of diagnostics at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, which is running the only laboratory in Liberia testing Ebola samples, said the deaths so far could be just the tip of the iceberg. &quot;I believe we're only seeing a small portion of the cases out there. The virus is getting to large, dense, city areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mounting sense of unease came as Dubai's Emirates airline became the first global carrier to announce it was suspending flights to the stricken area. The United States, Germany and France also issued warnings against travel to the three African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation has begun a &pound;60million drive to recruit several hundred additional staff to combat the west African crisis. Health experts say that since it is the first outbreak of its kind in the region, local officials have no practical experience in how to combat it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awa Faye has added a feature to her restaurant in Sierra Leone's hilly capital of Freetown: a sign that instructs patrons to wash their hands in the buckets of chlorinated water outside. &quot;I don't allow anybody inside if they don't wash your hands. We're all trying to protect ourselves from Ebola one way or another,&quot; said the 55-year old, who put the sign up after learning that the country's top Ebola doctor had died on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighbouring Liberia, residents in the capital, Monrovia, have also been placing &quot;Ebola buckets&quot; outside offices, restaurants and homes. In Guinea, the price of hand sanitiser has soared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to curb the world's biggest outbreak of Ebola, now spread across three countries, has shifted its emphasis from battling misinformation to treating patients who come forward, and finding those who have come into contact with victims of the highly contagious virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Sierra Leone and Liberia declared states of emergency this week, a summit between the presidents of all three countries and the World Health Organisation underlined a renewed sense of urgency over the largest ever epidemic of the disease, which has killed 729.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it,&quot; Margaret Chan, head of the WHO, said yesterday after a crisis meeting in Guinea's capital, Conakry. &quot;If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chan said the longer the virus circulated, the more it became a public risk: &quot;Constant mutation and adaptation are the survival mechanisms of viruses and other microbes. We must not give this virus opportunities to deliver more surprises.&quot; WHO said the summit &quot;must mark a turning point&quot;. A $100m fund will be used to back an emergency plan by all three countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea ranked last in a 2011 World Bank study of hospital beds per capita, and Liberia and Sierra Leone are both recovering from civil war. The weak health services have struggled to cope. Spread through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, Ebola has no known cure or vaccine, although early detection gives a greater chance of survival. Symptoms take up to 21 days to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Guinea, where the outbreak began, cases have now been confined to the forested interior region. But health officials said new hotspots had flared up, fuelled by cross-border trade and family ties. &quot;Yesterday we had a case of a man who fell ill while in Liberia. He came back home to Macenta so his family could look after him. They took him to hospital thinking it was malaria, and only there discovered it was in fact Ebola,&quot; said Sakouba Keita, the official directing the country's Ebola response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response has been further hampered as NGOs have reduced support staff in the affected countries. They include WaterAid and Samaritan's Purse, a medical charity with two of its US staff, including a doctor, now fighting the disease. &quot;My gut instinct is that it's going to get worse before it gets better, and we can't afford to take those risks any more,&quot; the director of another organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you leave behind even one burning ember, one case undetected, it could reignite the epidemic,&quot; Thomas Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters this week. He said the situation could take three to six months to bring under control. &quot;It's not going to be quick. It's not going to be easy. But we know what to do - so difficult as it is, it can be done.&quot; The CDC said it would send a further 50 specialists to boost the several dozen more expected from the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a region with communities are interlinked across porous borders, other countries are already tightening preventive measures. Nigerian officials began screening airport and seaport passengers this week after a Liberian man who collapsed in Lagos airport was later confirmed to have died of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast has set up four &quot;surveillance posts&quot; equipped with epidemiologists along its western border, where many maintain strong ties with Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime towards the end of the 14th century, the republic of Ragusa, now Dubrovnik, introduced a new law. No ship could land its cargo until a period of 30 days had elapsed. The measure was intended to prevent the spread of a new plague, the black death. Extended to 40 days, the law became known as quarantine. Long before Sir Tim Berners-Lee conceived the worldwide web and created the opportunity for the digital virus, disease - tracking the development of trade - was forming networks that linked host to host through cargoes of silk or wool in a chain of death and prosperity. Disease networks, like their digital counterparts, are disruptive. They challenge the normal mechanisms by which a state protects its citizens: they demand a global response.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the American historian William McNeill wrote about it in the 1970s, the connection between disease, demographic change and the fate of nations was not well understood. Now most historians accept that Athens might after all have defeated Sparta in the Peloponnesian war had a quarter of its army not been wiped out by plague. Six hundred years later, the long decline of the Roman empire began, arguably, in the second century AD with the Antonine plague. The consequences of the Aids epidemic in Africa are thought still to be reducing growth by 1% a year. The last Labour government spent &pound;1bn preparing for the threat of a swine flu pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear of epidemic retains its capacity to transfix the world. The deadly mutating viral disease has become the staple of Hollywood horror. A real epidemic is all the more arresting, particularly if it comes with nightmare symptoms and often fatal effects, like the viral disease Ebola that flared again in Guinea in February and has so far claimed more than 700 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear of epidemic and the epidemic itself need to be disentangled. Ebola, for example, is relatively hard to catch. Unlike, say, the respiratory illness Sars which is highly contagious even when its symptoms are indistinguishable from mild flu, Ebola is only spread by contact with bodily fluids. That generally happens when the patient is already probably too ill to fly, for example, limiting the risk of contagion. And even in rural west Africa, where it has taken hold with a previously unknown intensity, there have still been only about 1,300 cases in five months. So far, about half its victims are known to have died, a much lower rate than the 90% experienced in earlier outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is rightly an international effort to help the victims of Ebola in medical centres near the affected zones. That means overcoming local suspicion of foreign doctors, and tackling religious and cultural traditions of death and burial that risk spreading infection. It also means investing in research for an antidote for a disease that is not an obvious threat outside west Africa. Ebola is one of many neglected tropical diseases that sap the economic potential of the continent but do not offer enough incentive to companies with the necessary research expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deadly viruses challenge convention everywhere. The global authorisation regime for novel drugs is, rightly, extremely tightly drawn. But many of these newer viral infections are so lethal and kill their victims so fast that the epidemic peaks and subsides before a drug treatment can be rolled out. The innovative solution put forward by the Wellcome Trust is to change the protocol so that a new drug, if it had passed the earlier phases of safety and efficacy, could be used in the course of a real epidemic without the normal phase 2 trials on humans. That would require a big leap in trust. For that reason alone, trialling a new drug during an epidemic in Africa would look damagingly exploitative. But it may be that the most sensible response to the Ebola outbreak there is to prepare new protocols to fight every virus faster and more vigorously here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;As the literary awards season gets into gear and writers eye the Man Booker and other prize longlists, one author has already been singled out for a very special honour for which he has been acclaimed as not only &quot;a wonderful example of community spirit in action&quot;, but also as a &quot;hero&quot;. However, Sussex-based American humorist David Sedaris was lauded not for his books or New Yorker articles, but as &quot;a volunteer who devotes a great deal of time and energy to walking many miles clearing litter&quot; in the areas of Parham, Coldwaltham and Storrington, near his home. As a sign of their gratitude Horsham district council, reported the West Sussex County Times, this week named one of their dustcarts after him. Known as &quot;Pig Pen Sedaris&quot;, it is emblazoned with a cartoon pig.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedaris has previously featured in a BBC Radio 4 programme about his litter picking, in which he was accompanied on his route by Clare Balding, and recently wrote about his regime in the New Yorker. He explained how the purchase of a Fitbit, an electronic wristband that counts your steps, had revolutionised his productivity in spurring him on to record up to 60,000 steps a day, which equates to over 25 miles. &quot;Walking that distance at the age of 57, with completely flat feet while lugging a heavy bag of garbage, takes close to nine hours - a big block of time, but hardly wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as clearing litter, he says he also learned many things, such as the fact that some locals like having sex in their cars. &quot;I know this because I find their used condoms, sometimes on the road but more often just off it, in little pull-over areas. In addition to spent condoms, in one of the spots that I patrol I regularly pick up empty KFC containers and a great number of soiled Handi Wipes. Do they eat fried chicken and then have sex, or is it the other way round? I wonder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a splendid illustration of the adage that it matters more what you do than what you are, no mention whatsoever was made in the initial news report of Sedaris's career. But after the story went viral readers were given an update about their community-spirited neighbour, who they learned was not just an award-winning litter-picker, but also &quot;has a massive following in America as a Grammy-award winning author and comedian&quot;. Nicholas Wroe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&amp;#10002;Mood Indigo, out this week and starring Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou, is adapted from Boris Vian's L'Ecume des Jours. But how did the novelist find the time to write it? In occupied wartime Paris, he was an engineer by day and a jazz trumpeter by night - and also a host to visiting American jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. He was Jean-Paul Sartre's licensed jester, writing a joky column (&quot;liar's news&quot;) for Sartre's otherwise grim magazine Les Temps Modernes, sending up the unlikely emergence of &quot;Jean-Sol Partre&quot; as a celebrity in L'Ecume, and connecting Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir with the so-called &quot;existentialist cellars&quot; in St Germain des Pres where Vian and Juliette Greco performed (relations became frostier, however, when Sartre began an affair with Michelle Vian - the dedicatee of L'Ecume and model for its heroine - although by 1949 the Vians' marriage was already heading for divorce).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vian is also credited with launching Serge Gainsbourg's career, making St Tropez the place where trendy Parisians holidayed, possibly shaping the freewheeling spirit of Godard's early films, and helping to inspire the student revolt of May 68.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even pigeon-holing him as someone out to make the world merrier is too limiting for the protean Vian, as he wrote three bloody pastiches of US pulp fiction, posing as American author &quot;Vernon Sullivan&quot;, and was prosecuted and fined after a tabloid furore when a copy of the most notorious, I Will Spit On Your Graves, was found in the hotel room of a married man who had shot his lover and then himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Published in 1947, L'Ecume starts as romcom and ends as tragedy. But its originality lies in the fantastical world Vian conjures around his protagonists Colin and Chloe; and in the jazz-like playful prose that has led critics to link him with Raymond Queneau and Georges Perec as post-surrealist &quot;comedians of language&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle, now in her 90s, was able to attend a screening of Gondry's film in Paris, but Vian died in 1959, aged only 39 - he may in fact be the only author ever killed by seeing his work adapted, as he collapsed mid-protest (his last words may have been &quot;My arse!&quot;) at a screening of a film of I Will Spit on Your Graves.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY FIONA MACRAE SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">769 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ebola virus could spread to Britain in the meat of chimps, giant bats and other exotic species smuggled into the UK and eaten as a delicacy, it is feared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists say that African bush meat' hidden in suitcases and sold in London markets is a huge problem' and could be harbouring the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning comes as UK border staff said they are unprepared to deal with infected travellers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities have warned that the disease, one of deadliest known to man, is absolutely out of control' in west Africa and the World Health Organisation will today launch a $100million (&pound;60million) plan to fight the unprecedented' threat. Latest figures from the WHO show there have been 122 new cases - an increase of more than 10 per cent - in four days. Another 57 deaths have been recorded, taking the toll to 729.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some experts say that difficulty in compiling the statistics means the official figures are likely to be just the tip of the iceberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? The US has warned that Ebola is one plane ride away' from the West and advised against non-essential travel to Ebola-hit nations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and called in troops to quarantine epicentres of Ebola;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Nigeria and Sierra Leone have introduced screening at airports;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">? The US Peace Corps placed two aid workers in isolation and began to evacuate hundreds more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, is spread by body fluids including sweat and saliva and there is no cure and no vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International concern has been inflamed by the death of an US finance consultant who flew into Lagos in Nigeria, Africa's biggest city and a transport hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some experts say the disease could also come to the UK in bush meat - traded in markets or simply given to relatives as a present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters the UK every year. The strain of Ebola that is on the rampage in west Africa is thought to have come from a hunter handling an infected bat. Professor John Oxford, one of Britain's leading virologists, described the illegal import of animals from bats to chimps as a huge problem'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Professor Robert Dingwall, an infectious diseases expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: Similar meat that could have caused this outbreak may well end up in a market stall in London.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that much of the meat smuggled in is dried or smoked but some of it is fresh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: People will put a bloody carcass in a suitcase and take that on a plane. It is a remote risk but if that is how we think Ebola moves from animal to human inside west Africa, there's no reason to suppose it wouldn't happen here.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Kock, a professor of wildlife health and emerging diseases at the Royal Veterinary College, said it is very, very possible' that some suitcases will contain fruit bats - the creatures some blame for the current outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he added that the main risk remains air passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border staff said they were unprepared for the task of spotting sickly passengers at airports,.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Service Union, told the BBC her members were very concerned'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: They are the first port of contact and the concern is what they do if they are confronted with someone that doesn't appear well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no health facility at the border, there is no containment facility and until extremely recently there has been no guidance issued to staff as to what they should do.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Border Force spokesman said staff have been given clear guidance on how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers and health officials have stressed that the chances of Ebola spreading in the UK are remote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM AFRICAN BUSH TO OUR MARKET STALLS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&divide;Nearly 7,500 tons of illegal meat enters Britain each year - including cuts from exotic animals disguised as beef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&divide;The charity Born Free Wild says animals from all over Africa, from giraffe to zebra, and even endangered species such as gorillas and elephants, are snared by poachers, butchered, and then transported to city markets and restaurants across the globe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS A LAST line of defence in stopping the spread of the Ebola virus to Britain, Lungi International Airport in Sierra Leone would not be an obvious choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sitting on the far side of an estuary from the capital, Freetown, the tiny airport terminal is accessed via a collection of ageing ferries and taxi-boats - none of which, as the Foreign Office travel guide points out, is &quot;without risk&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lungi is the only airport that operates flights from Africa's Ebola-affected region directly to London and Britain is relying on its security officials to screen passengers for the disease as they board the four-times weekly flight to Heathrow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, people heading for the airport were required to wash their hands in chlorinated water before embarking on the estuary crossing, and then again when they entered the terminal, which is open only to people with airline tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A masked official with an infra-red temperature gun - which requires no bodily contact - then assessed passengers for any sign of fevers. Anyone with a temperature above 101.6F (38.7C) was banned from travelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that the disease has an incubation period of up to three weeks before symptoms begin, there was nothing to stop potential carriers boarding the British Airways Flight 136 to Heathrow, which starts its journey in neighbouring Liberia, another affected nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health experts said that, despite the growing spread of the disease across the region - yesterday Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and 57 more deaths were reported, taking the toll to 727 - there was not yet any need to consider a ban on direct flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the disease does continue to spread through west Africa, there will probably be sporadic cases arriving at Heathrow via direct flights,&quot; said Dr Derek Gatherer, a specialist in the evolution of viruses at Lancaster University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But right now I don't think there is much to worry about. The infected areas are mainly villages in remote areas, where people are not generally in the habit of international travel. The other main 'at risk' group are medics who have treated affected people, but they do generally take very stringent precautions against being infected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation said it was launching a $100million (&pound;59million) fund to improve the response to the outbreak across the region, which will bring in several hundred new staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US also issued a new travel warning to its citizens, urging them to avoid &quot;non-essential&quot; visits to the three affected countries - Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The move represents a greater level of official caution than the Foreign Office, which has so far stuck to posting warnings on its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Lungi, staff appeared to be taking their duties seriously, with no passenger allowed to enter the airport without being checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Posters around the terminal warned people of the telltale signs of the illness, which include vomiting, bleeding from the eyes and acute diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For passengers who could not read or write, a set of graphic illustrations left nothing to the imagination. Other symbols showed a picture of a monkey with a line through it - a warning to avoid eating the bushmeat that is thought to have been the source of the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passengers for the six-hour BA flight seemed largely unconcerned. While a few wore protective white gloves to reduce the risk of infection by handshake, none claimed to be leaving Sierra Leone because of fears about Ebola's spread. Momodu Koroma, 57, a businessman, said: &quot;There was ample screening at the airport, with every single passenger checked, which made me feel very relieved. I took care to stay safe in Freetown but in certain parts of the country there's a lot of fear. I feel glad in a sense to be leaving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, on arriving at Heathrow, passengers said they did not undergo additional checks or receive additional advice on what to do if they fell ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the government of Sierra Leone began increasing its efforts to counter the disease, ordering the authorities to conduct house-to-house searches for anyone suspected of having Ebola but failing to come forward for treatment. Umar Khan, Sierra Leone's sole virologist, who was branded a &quot;national hero&quot; after saving the lives of more than 100 Ebola patients before succumbing to the disease, was buried yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In neighbouring Liberia, officials begun closing schools in infected areas and ordering most public servants to stay away from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US Peace Corps began withdrawing hundreds of volunteers posted to the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kent Brantly, 33, an American, reportedly took &quot;a slight turn for the worse overnight&quot; yesterday, according to Samaritan's Purse, the charity for which he worked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hubs such as Heathrow have yet to tighten procedures even though airports in Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa have introduced tough new screening checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, wrote to Theresa May, the Home Secretary, demanding to know which entry point in Britain was most at risk and what steps were in place for isolating the disease at the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am concerned that officers enforcing our borders suggest they may not be fully prepared to protect the public from the spread of this deadly virus,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lucy Moreton, the Immigration Service Union general secretary, said workers were worried about being infected and had not been given proper advice about how to deal with people suspected of being sick.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia and Sierra Leone have declared states of emergency, ordering the closure of schools and markets and the quarantining of affected communities, in an attempt to halt the Ebola epidemic that has claimed more than 700 lives across west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of both countries have cancelled planned trips to Washington for a US-Africa summit next week so they can meet today in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, to discuss the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, where a Liberian civil servant died of Ebola after flying to the commercial hub of Lagos, airport authorities began screening passengers for high temperatures who were arriving from places at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, announced the emergency measures after a closed-door meeting earlier this week in which medical officials painted a stark picture, according to an aide present at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal ministry of health reports obtained by the Guardian show health workers saw 606 people suspected of having the extremely contagious virus in a single day this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bomi county, one of the areas recommended for quarantine, the report noted &quot;both probable and negative cases are being held in the same room with no attention&quot;. Health officials there were requesting training, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a dire situation. The spread is overwhelming health workers and facilities. We need all the help and support we can get from the international community,&quot; said Lewis Brown, Liberia's information minister. He said communities hit hardest would be quarantined for as long as necessary by security forces. &quot;It's an emergency, so we hope people will understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone's president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said the state of emergency would last between 60 and 90 days. House-to-house searches to trace victims will be conducted and new at-risk neighbourhoods will be placed under quarantine if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nationwide hunt was sparked in the capital, Freetown, when a patient was forcibly removed from hospital last week. She was reported to have died while being returned to the facility in an ambulance two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest action comes as senior western officials, including from the US and UK, held meetings to assess the risk of Ebola reaching their shores. The US has recalled its Peace Corps volunteers from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures taken are similar to those that rapidly ended a 1997 Ebola breakout in Uganda, which has sent in a medical team to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many rural communities view Ebola with much the same fear and misunderstanding as westerners did when the Aids epidemic began, and have sometimes attacked overstretched health officials struggling to contain the epidemic. Those on the frontlines have been among the hardest hit by the disease, which has claimed the lives of Liberia and Sierra Leone's most experienced Ebola doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are signs that some public awareness campaigns are yielding results. Doctors were forced to turn patients away at one of Liberia's main Ebola isolation wards in a sign many were belatedly coming forward. Some residents in the capital, Monrovia, initially protested against a new ward being set up, fearing it would endanger them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, this Ebola outbreak has killed 729 people since it originated in Guinea, where health officials took several weeks to pinpoint the source to a remote village. By then, it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian authorities have mobilised unusually swiftly, underlying concern about an outbreak in the continent's most populous nation and major commerce hub. Officials began printing information leaflets, including in widely-spoken pidgin English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akintayo Ugwani, a businessman, said: &quot;It's terrifying. I have to get on a flight every couple of days and each time now I'm just wondering, am I entering a flying coffin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's main airline, Arik Air, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while international airports and seaports have been placed on red alert, with passengers being monitored. Ghana also began screening passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, chaired an emergency Cobra meeting amid warnings that the virus could be a threat to Britain, although health experts said the country was well prepared to deal with any potential cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammond said no British national had been affected by the outbreak and there had been no cases in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK announced a &pound;2m package of assistance to the Red Cross and Medecins sans Frontieres, which are tackling Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Boseley, health editor</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 15</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">797 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2002, scientists writing in a leading American medical journal discussed the possibility that the Ebola virus could be used in a biochemical weapon. It would be technically difficult and unlikely to cause mass destruction because those infected quickly die and the virus is not as transmissible as many assume. But, the scientists warned, if it could be done, there would be no protection. No vaccine or drug treatment exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association in the wake of 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks in New York. Since then, fear of viruses raining out of US skies has diminished - and so has any sense of urgency over the development of vaccines or treatment for a disease that manifests itself in unpredictable outbreaks and kills relatively small numbers of people in remote parts of Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neglected tropical diseases, of which Ebola is one, become visible in the west only when they appear to threaten it. Ebola has had more attention than many, probably because of the dramatic nature of the disease and the need for full body suits and face masks for those caring for its victims. The names of other such diseases - the parasitic leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis, for example - hardly trip off the tongue in London or San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Ebola is not a priority for the not-for-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, which works with the World Health Organisation and others to incentivise and encourage pharmaceutical companies to research and develop treatments. It affects far fewer people than parasitic diseases, and the outbreaks, although appalling, are sporadic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a few research institutes and biotech companies in north America, there is work going on, some of it funded by the American military. The US department of defence Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems has put $140m (&pound;80m) into the early development of a potential drug by the Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, which dosed its first human subject in January this year. The phase 1 trial is designed only to ensure the drug has no ill effects in healthy people who have been nowhere near the Ebola virus, but last week, it was put on hold while the regulator, the food and drug administration, asked for more information to ensure the safety of the volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were protests over the FDA's intervention and calls for the drug to be fast-tracked, since more than 600 people in west Africa had already died. But even if the FDA felt it was a good idea to test the drug on patients in Africa, trials in humans take so long to set up that the current outbreak will probably be over by the time anybody is ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some vaccines in development which look promising. &quot;Many of them have just been tested in mice and guinea pigs, but a few have been tested in non-human primates and worked, protecting them from challenge with the virus,&quot; said Professor Diane Griffin from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But however great the need, rushing the vaccine to an outbreak of Ebola in west Africa is not on the cards. &quot;I think people are really anxious just because the vaccines haven't been tested in humans for safety as far as I know,&quot; said Griffin, of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the school's centre for global health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running a trial in the middle of a disease outbreak is really difficult too, because of the careful explanation that must be given to all those who are vaccinated - and those who are not - who are in a distressing situation. Potential side-effects must be talked through and informed consent given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if there are to be vaccines and drugs against Ebola, trials in outbreaks will have to be done. &quot;It would be unethical not to acknowledge that potential new treatments could both save lives and reduce transmission in this and future outbreaks,&quot; says Professor Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. &quot;Is it time to fast track those with clear safety data in humans for use in this epidemic?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes it is essential for those with promising drugs or vaccines to be ready to go. They must have done all the preparatory work, the early testing and safety checks, have got the approval of ethical and regulatory bodies and have local and national governments as well as NGOs on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a complex situation, requiring very careful consideration,&quot; Farrar says. But ultimately, the only way to find out if drugs and vaccines against Ebola work is to try them out in an epidemic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many rural communities view Ebola with much the same fear and misunderstanding as westerners did when the Aids epidemic began, and have sometimes attacked overstretched health officials struggling to contain the epidemic. Those on the frontlines have been among the hardest hit by the disease, which has claimed the lives of Liberia and Sierra Leone's most experienced Ebola doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are signs that some public awareness campaigns are yielding results. Doctors were forced to turn patients away at one of Liberia's main Ebola isolation wards in a sign many were belatedly coming forward. Some residents in the capital, Monrovia, initially protested against a new ward being set up, fearing it would endanger them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, this Ebola outbreak has killed 729 people since it originated in Guinea, where health officials took several weeks to pinpoint the source to a remote village. By then, it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian authorities have mobilised unusually swiftly, underlying concern about an outbreak in the continent's most populous nation and major commerce hub. Officials began printing information leaflets, including in widely-spoken pidgin English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akintayo Ugwani, a businessman, said: &quot;It's terrifying. I have to get on a flight every couple of days and each time now I'm just wondering, am I entering a flying coffin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's main airline, Arik Air, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while international airports and seaports have been placed on red alert, with passengers being monitored. Ghana also began screening passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, chaired an emergency Cobra meeting amid warnings that the virus could be a threat to Britain, although health experts said the country was well prepared to deal with any potential cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammond said no British national had been affected by the outbreak and there had been no cases in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK announced a &pound;2m package of assistance to the Red Cross and Medecins sans Frontieres, which are tackling Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The European commission said it would allocate an additional euros 2m (&pound;1.6m) - on top of euros 1.9m - to help contain the epidemic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2002, scientists writing in a leading American medical journal discussed the possibility that the Ebola virus could be used in a biochemical weapon. It would be technically difficult and unlikely to cause mass destruction because those infected quickly die and the virus is not as transmissible as many assume. But, the scientists warned, if it could be done, there would be no protection. No vaccine or drug treatment exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association in the wake of 9/11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks in New York. Since then, fear of viruses raining out of US skies has diminished - and so has any sense of urgency over the development of vaccines or treatment for a disease that manifests itself in unpredictable outbreaks and kills relatively small numbers of people in remote parts of Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neglected tropical diseases, of which Ebola is one, become visible in the west only when they appear to threaten it. Ebola has had more attention than many, probably because of the dramatic nature of the disease and the need for full body suits and face masks for those caring for its victims. The names of other such diseases - the parasitic leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis, for example - hardly trip off the tongue in London or San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Ebola is not a priority for the not-for-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, which works with the World Health Organisation and others to incentivise and encourage pharmaceutical companies to research and develop treatments. It affects far fewer people than parasitic diseases, and the outbreaks, although appalling, are sporadic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a few research institutes and biotech companies in north America, there is work going on, some of it funded by the American military. The US department of defence Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems has put $140m (&pound;80m) into the early development of a potential drug by the Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, which dosed its first human subject in January this year. The phase 1 trial is designed only to ensure the drug has no ill effects in healthy people who have been nowhere near the Ebola virus, but last week, it was put on hold while the regulator, the food and drug administration, asked for more information to ensure the safety of the volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were protests over the FDA's intervention and calls for the drug to be fast-tracked, since more than 600 people in west Africa had already died. But even if the FDA felt it was a good idea to test the drug on patients in Africa, trials in humans take so long to set up that the current outbreak will probably be over by the time anybody is ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some vaccines in development which look promising. &quot;Many of them have just been tested in mice and guinea pigs, but a few have been tested in non-human primates and worked, protecting them from challenge with the virus,&quot; said Professor Diane Griffin from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But however great the need, rushing the vaccine to an outbreak of Ebola in west Africa is not on the cards. &quot;I think people are really anxious just because the vaccines haven't been tested in humans for safety as far as I know,&quot; said Griffin, of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the school's centre for global health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running a trial in the middle of a disease outbreak is really difficult too, because of the careful explanation that must be given to all those who are vaccinated - and those who are not - who are in a distressing situation. Potential side-effects must be talked through and informed consent given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if there are to be vaccines and drugs against Ebola, trials in outbreaks will have to be done. &quot;It would be unethical not to acknowledge that potential new treatments could both save lives and reduce transmission in this and future outbreaks,&quot; says Professor Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. &quot;Is it time to fast track those with clear safety data in humans for use in this epidemic?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes it is essential for those with promising drugs or vaccines to be ready to go. They must have done all the preparatory work, the early testing and safety checks, have got the approval of ethical and regulatory bodies and have local and national governments as well as NGOs on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a complex situation, requiring very careful consideration,&quot; Farrar says. But ultimately, the only way to find out if drugs and vaccines against Ebola work is to try them out in an epidemic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone athlete Moses Sesay was tested for virus and other conditions after being admitted to hospital in Glasgow feeling ill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commonwealth Games officials in Glasgow have dismissed any concerns about Ebola contagion after it emerged that a cyclist competing for Sierra Leone was tested for the virus with negative results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moses Sesay, 32, was tested for Ebola among a series of other conditions after being admitted to a Glasgow hospital last week feeling unwell. An epidemic of the virus has killed more than 700 people across West Africa, with Sierra Leone and Liberia declaring states of emergency this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sesay told the Mirror he fell ill a week ago: &quot;I was sick. I felt tired and listless. All the doctors were in special suits to treat me - they dressed like I had Ebola. I was very scared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I was admitted for four days and they tested me for Ebola. It came back negative but they did it again and this time sent it to London, where it was also negative. After that, the doctors dressed normally again so I was relieved. I would like to thank the Scottish medical staff; they were very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cyclist recovered sufficiently to compete in the men's time trial event on Thursday, where he finished 56th, last among competitors who completed the course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: &quot;There is no Ebola in the athletes village of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. We can confirm an athlete was tested for a number of things when he fell ill last week, including Ebola. The tests were negative and the athlete competed in his event on Thursday. We are dismayed by some of the sensational and misleading headlines to date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Health Protection Scotland (HPS)said that no one has tested positive for Ebola in Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, surfaces or food, the current Ebola outbreak has killed 729 people since it originated in Guinea. By the time health officials pinpointed the source to a remote village it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Colin Ramsay of HPS said medical staff at the Games and more widely had been briefed to look out for Ebola. &quot;Steps have been taken to remind healthcare practitioners across the whole of the UK about being aware of Ebola infection, particularly in people coming from these affected countries,&quot; he told BBC Radio Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsay said: &quot;There's been no programme of actively screening athletes simply because of the Commonwealth Games. The situation is that if someone presents with symptoms suggestive of the possibility of Ebola virus infection and who has come from a country affected by the current outbreak - and that's Sierra Leone and Guinea and Liberia - they would be investigated accordingly and that would involve managing them with a set of standard precautions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;People in this sort of situation would be investigated for a number of conditions, not just Ebola. Sometimes people have more common diseases such as malaria, so they are given a battery of tests to exclude all these diseases, but there are special tests that would be done for Ebola in these circumstances if someone has been in a country affected by the outbreak in the relevant period.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisers of the Commonwealth Games said on Friday that there was no threat to the athletes' village from the Ebola virus, after it emerged that a competitor from Sierra Leone had been tested in Glasgow for the deadly infection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no Ebola in the athletes' village,&quot; Glasgow 2014 spokeswoman Jackie Brock-Doyle said. &quot;There is no Ebola in Scotland.&quot; Moses Sesay, a cyclist in the Sierra Leonean squad, had been tested for Ebola among a number of other viruses after falling ill last week, the organisation said, but the results had been negative and he had competed as expected in Thursday's individual time trial event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The west African country is one of a number currently affected by the most deadly outbreak of the disease to date, which the director of the World Health Organisation said on Friday was &quot;moving faster than efforts to control it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was some confusion about a second athlete from the country, after Sierra Leone's chef de mission at the Games told the Daily Telegraph that another cyclist, Mohamed Tholley, had failed to compete in the same event and had possibly absconded. &quot;The situation is very serious at home, and it is possible this is why he does not want to return,&quot; the paper quoted Unisa Deen Kargbo as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brock-Doyle later said the organisers were not alarmed. &quot;We have now contacted the chef de mission and asked if they are concerned about the welfare of this athlete, has he gone missing, and whether they would like us to help, and they have said they are not concerned about the welfare or whereabouts of this athlete.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITISH doctor Hannah Spencer yesterday told of her gruelling battle to help Ebola victims in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old from Surrey volunteered to work in Guinea and Liberia - the crucible of the outbreak - for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her stifling protective suit was the only barrier between her and the deadly virus as she worked with victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Spencer, who has just returned to the UK from a three-week deployment, said: I wouldn't say I felt completely calm - obviously you have some anxieties before you go. But once you've done your first day in the isolation ward, when you're wearing all the protective gear, you feel safe to work with the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's difficult working in the protective clothing - it's very hot, and you can't spend more than an hour inside it. So when you've got a large number of patients, it's hard to feel that you are spending long enough with each one.' Two American doctors - Kent Brantly, 33, and Nancy Writebol, 60 - have contracted Ebola and are fighting for their lives. The disease kills 90 per cent of those who are infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To minimise the risk of infection, medical staff have to wear thick rubber boots that come up to their knees, an impermeable body suit, gloves, a face mask, a hood and goggles to ensure no air at all can touch their skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Spencer and her colleagues lost up to five litres of sweat during a shift and had to spend two hours rehydrating afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went first to Guinea and then to a rural clinic in Foya, Liberia, where the ten-bed isolation unit became crammed with 22 patients within days of her arrival, with many lying on mattresses on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders gives volunteers a buddy' to watch out for symptoms. When they return to their home countries they have to remain within a short driving distance of a hospital in case they later discover they are exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Spencer said she had faced little resistance from her family when she told them about her volunteering, and her mother told her: As if I could stop you from going!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor added: One 15-year-old girl was inside the isolation ward for over a week and I really thought she was going to die. But then she started to get better. That was a wonderful moment.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers thought to have the virus will be barred from boarding flights heading to the UK - and will be held at immigration if they appear ill on arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will then be quarantined in highly secure isolation units, such as those at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. But because it takes up to three weeks for symptoms to appear, there are fears some victims will slip through the net.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors have been told to look out for symptoms of the disease and travellers returning from West Africa are urged to seek immediate medical help if they develop flu-like symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the deadliest diseases known to man, Ebola has already claimed more than 670 lives in its worst-ever outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, the virus, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims, has spread out of the countryside to large towns and cities, raising fears it will arrive in Britain on an international flight. It can be spread through sweat and saliva and there is no vaccine or cure. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee on the outbreak yesterday, said Ebola was a very serious threat'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he sought to calm fears, saying it most unlikely' that Ebola could spread within the UK because of frankly different' standards of infection control here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the logical approach was to tackle the outbreak at its source in West Africa, adding: We do not, at the moment, think this is an issue that affects the UK directly.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS was looking at its capability and taking precautionary measures' but he was very confident' it will be able to cope if the disease arrived in the UK. In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">??The Foreign Office said it had not advised against travel to affected areas, but it was monitoring the situation closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">??Experts said the survival of anyone who catches the disease was in the lap of the gods'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">??Public Health England said the outbreak was clearly not yet under control' and was the most acute health emergency' facing Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">??A charity warned that the outbreak was speeding up rather than slowing down' and the EU pledged &pound;1.6million to stopping it spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">??There was speculation the RAF will be called to repatriate any infected Britons from West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone within weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But international concern has been inflamed by the death of an American finance consultant in the Nigerian city of Lagos, Africa's biggest and most densely populated metropolis and an international transport hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sawyer, 40, had been on his way back to the US after attending the funeral of his sister in Liberia. She had also died from the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways flies daily to Lagos and also has regular flights to Freetown in Sierra Leone and Monrovia in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff at all airlines have the discretion to deny boarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BA spokesman said: The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin Atlantic said its staff had been trained to spot symptoms, which range from flu-like fever and malaise initially, to vomiting, diarrhoea and, eventually, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Sufferers can suffer from convulsions and fall into a coma before dying from massive and irreparable damage to their internal organs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear last night to what extent the UK would follow the practice of some countries and track down and quarantine all passengers on a plane used by a suspected sufferer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the tone of the latest official guidance suggested only those known to be in close physical proximity - five rows of seats surrounding the suspect - will be contacted for checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England, insisted that airline passengers had little to fear, as direct contact with bodily fluids is needed for the disease to spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he admitted that it is not impossible' that someone who is infected, could arrive in the UK before developing any symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heathrow Airport said it had a medical team on constant duty with the power to detain, isolate or send to hospital people with suspicious symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Derek Gatherer, a Lancaster University expert on disease spread, said: There is no treatment - nothing you can do yourself. It's in the lap of the gods if you're lucky to be one of the few who survive.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ben Neuman, a Reading University virologist, said Ebola will come here eventually - but predicted it will be caught and shut down by border staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office sought to play down the likelihood of an outbreak in the UK, saying the Government is confident the UK has experienced people who are ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive here'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: We have experienced scientists and doctors - the Royal Free Infectious Disease Unit, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - and a lot of experience of dealing with dangerous diseases. The risk of this disease spreading fast in the UK is much lower because of that.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has closed all its schools, quarantined a number of communities and placed all non-essential workers on compulsory leave as part of an action plan that will be enforced by security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said hospitals were overwhelmed, an isolation unit in the capital Monrovia was over-run and patients were being treated in their homes. Information minister Lewis Brown said: This is a major public health emergency.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN is ready for an Ebola outbreak if the disease arrives in the UK, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Hunt said that the expertise and experience of NHS medical staff meant that Britain would be able to &quot;deal with anything&quot; which might threaten public health in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday US health officials warned that Western countries were just &quot;one plane ride away&quot; from infection while David Cameron said the Ebola outbreak was a &quot;very serious threat&quot; to the UK .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charities on the front line also said the disease was almost certain to spread to new countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But after a meeting of the Government's emergency planning committee, Cobra, ministers said that although the West African outbreak was &quot;significant&quot; it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that it would spread in Britain, with only isolated cases likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Hunt said: &quot;We have a lot of experience of dealing with diseases that are very dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are very confident that we have very good people in the NHS, very experienced people who will be ready to deal with anything, if it were to arrive in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disease, which can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of infected victims, has now killed more than 670 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charity Action Aid said the outbreak was &quot;the worst the world has ever seen&quot; and was &quot;speeding up rather than slowing down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there have been no reported cases of Ebola in Britain yet. Two Britons have been tested after reporting symptoms, but neither had the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, who chaired yesterday's meeting of Cobra, said: &quot;I would emphasise again, in terms of the UK, the issue is about the possibility of somebody who has contracted the disease in Africa getting sick here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not about the disease spreading in the UK because we have frankly different standards of infection control procedure that would make that most unlikely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia and Sierra Leone have declared national emergencies with Liberia closing all schools and putting all non-essential government workers on compulsory 30-day leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some airlines have stopped flying into infected West African countries, although British airlines said they would continue to travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Health England warned health officials to be on the lookout for any unexplained illness in people returning from the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Health said: &quot;Protecting the public from infectious diseases is a priority and we lead the world in this field. We are well-prepared to identify and deal with any potential cases of Ebola, though there has never been a case in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines. The virus then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health workers tackling the outbreak have been especially vulnerable. Dr Sheik Umar Khan, who had been hailed as a national hero for his work treating patients with Ebola in Sierra Leone, died on Tuesday after being quarantined in a hospital in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two American health workers are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease, prompting two US missionary groups to evacuate non-essential personnel from the country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Royal Air Force is on standby to bring back UK citizens from West Africa if they are suspected of being infected with Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Cameron yesterday warned that the outbreak posed a &quot;very serious threat&quot; to the UK, and Cobra, the Government's emergency committee, was convened to discuss how to tighten defences against the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major Thomas Fletcher, of the Royal Army Medical Corps, said the military would be on alert to &quot;repatriate&quot; Britons infected with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RAF's Infection Prevention Control Team is on standby to collect UK citizens and return them to Britain in quarantine conditions if they are suspected of being infected with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major Fletcher, a consultant on infectious diseases who has been seconded to the World Health Organisation to help with the outbreak, said: &quot;The UK has a close relationship with West Africa and there will be British citizens in those countries. Cobra will be discussing the possibility of the Royal Air Force offering assistance to UK nationals abroad who may become infected and who need to be repatriated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major Fletcher said it was a concern that one Ebola victim, Patrick Sawyer, had travelled on two flights in Africa before he died in Nigeria and warned that infected travellers risked &quot;importing&quot; the disease to the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The passenger who died in Nigeria is clearly a concern as it is highly likely he was infectious during the flights he took, and potentially there are people out there who are also now infected,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the advent of global travel there is increasing risk of importing Ebola into the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two Britons have already been tested in London and Birmingham after reporting symptoms, but neither had the disease. Prof Robert Dingwall, of Nottingham Trent University, suggested people travelling back from West Africa who were worried about picking up the disease should go into &quot;voluntary quarantine&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will almost always be something else,&quot; he said. &quot;But it would be sensible to make absolutely sure, possibly with additional blood tests or recommending voluntary quarantine - 'stay at home until you feel better or we see what happens' .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Derek Gatherer, a specialist in the evolution of viruses from Lancaster University, warned that passengers who had flown alongside Mr Sawyer could be &quot;anywhere in the world by now&quot; adding: &quot;Aids spread from Central Africa to the western world in the 1980s - Ebola could do the same. Anyone on the same plane could have become infected because Ebola is easy to catch. That is why there is such alarm over Mr Sawyer because he became ill on the flight so anyone else sharing the plane could have been infected by his vomit or other bodily fluids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, who chaired yesterday's meeting of Cobra, said the Government was considering &quot;extra precautions&quot; but added that it was &quot;most unlikely&quot; that Ebola could spread within the UK because of worldclass standards of infection control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH doctor fighting the Ebola outbreak in west Africa told last night how belief in witchcraft was hampering the fight to stop the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamin Black, 32, a volunteer with the charity M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res in Sierra Leone, said that some people in infected areas were not seeking medical treatment as they thought the disease was the work of sorcerers. Belief in witchcraft and traditional medicine is still prevalent in parts of west Africa, particularly the remote rural areas of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia where the outbreak has been concentrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Black, who completed a four-day stint earlier this week at an Ebola treatment clinic in Kailahun, near Sierra Leone's northern border with Guinea, told The Daily Telegraph: &quot;There is a section of population here who simply don't believe Ebola is real, they think it is witchcraft and so they don't come to the treatment centres.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Black, who is from Manchester but currently works as an obstetrics and gynaecology registrar at north London's Whittington Hospital, went to Sierra Leone in June, where he originally expected to be working in maternity wards. He was seconded to an Ebola clinic in the wake of the spread of the epidemic, the largest of its kind in medical history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 1,200 cases have so far been reported in the three affected nations, with 224 deaths in Sierra Leone, 129 in Liberia, and 319 in Guinea, where the outbreak is thought to have begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the fatalities in Sierra Leone was Sheik Umar Khan, a doctor who was playing a leading part in the fight against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Avoiding a similar fate has been one of the main challenges for Dr Black and his colleagues in the 56-bed clinic at Kailahun, which lies in a densely forested district that is at the centre of one of the worst outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While treating patients, medics must wear an allencompassing plastic yellow body suit, two face masks, two pairs of gloves, a plastic apron and medical scrubs. In Sierra Leone's humid, tropical heat - temperatures at this time of year are around 80F - those wearing the suits have to be careful not to pass out from the heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I once tried working in it in the heat of midday and could barely last 15 minutes,&quot; said Dr Black. &quot;Most of the time we try to start very early in the morning before the sun comes up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After working, each medic disrobes in a special noncontaminated area, where each garment has to be sprayed with chlorine as it is removed. Outside of work, they also observe a strict &quot;no touch&quot; policy, and even handshakes are forbidden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A lot of health workers have unfortunately contacted the illness already, and the risks are very high,&quot; Dr Black said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clinic, he said, operated a triage assessment system to work out which patients were confirmed as having the disease. Many Ebola sufferers do not seem particularly ill at first, complaining only of flulike coughs or vomiting rather than the nose and eye-bleeds that characterise its later stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But doctors can go on certain warning signs, in particular patients saying that they have recently attended a funeral of a friend or relative. Local funeral customs often include the practice of touching and kissing loved ones' bodies, which by that stage are a prime incubator of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Black added that many of those referred to the clinic were children, some of whom had already lost both parents to the disease. &quot;We had one ambulance turn up with a mother and a child in it, but the mother had died during the journey to the clinic, leaving her daughter of eight on her own,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola has a fatality of around 90 per cent, but if treated early enough, patients can fight the disease off. During Dr Black's time at the clinic, every day &quot;a couple&quot; of patients usually pulled through and were discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The discharges were amazing, emotional occasions, where the whole clinic, from the cleaning staff to the head of the mission, would come out and give big applause,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is that often the kids are coming out as orphans, and they may face stigma when they get home because they've had Ebola, although we send outreach workers with them to spread the message that they are OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another problem, he added, was that the medics' spaceman-like attire frightened local people. In Guinea, some village chiefs have barred medics from entering, claiming that they are actually spreading the disease. Other teams of doctors have been threatened by mobs with machetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many patients who come to us are already very sick by the time they do so, and so often all people see at the clinic is a doctor sticking a needle in someone for a blood test and then them dying shortly afterwards,&quot; said Dr Black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That becomes a conspiracy theory that we are actually injecting them with something that kills them. There is a huge amount of work that needs to be done in terms of education on all this, otherwise this epidemic is just going to continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is just &quot;one plane ride away&quot; from Western countries, health experts warned yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US said the outbreak highlighted the need for countries across the globe to increase health security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patrick Sawyer, 40, an American, was able to travel on two flights in West Africa despite showing symptoms of the deadly disease. He died in Lagos, Nigeria, but had been due to return to his home of Minnesota next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's true that anyone with an illness is just one plane ride away from coming to the US,&quot; said John O'Connor, a spokesman for the CDC. &quot;But we have protections in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charity M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res said there was no overarching strategy to tackle the outbreak and warned there was a &quot;real risk&quot; of new countries being infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bart Janssens, MSF's director of operations, said: &quot;This epidemic is unprecedented, absolutely out of control and the situation can only get worse, because it is still spreading, above all in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in some very important hot spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the situation does not improve fairly quickly, there is a real risk of new countries being affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two African airlines - Arik and Asky - have grounded flights into infected areas, but British companies said they were planning to keep flying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for British Airways said: &quot;The safety of our customers and crew is our first priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are complying with guidance provided by local health authorities and are continuing to monitor the situation closely. Currently our flights to the region are operating as normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virgin also said it would not be stopping flights, but was monitoring the situation at international and local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We always follow the advice of the World Health Organisation in such matters,&quot; said a spokesman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers said yesterday Britain had the expertise and resources to deal with the deadly Ebola virus should it come to the UK, after holding an emergency Cobra meeting to consider the threat from the disease's deadliest ever outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, below, chaired the meeting and said the virus, which has killed more than 600 people in west Africa, was not growing exponentially and was containable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems in the worst outbreak areas to be contained at the present time, so that is obviously the logical approach, to try to provide additional resources to deal with the disease at source,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said Britain had experienced doctors who could deal with infectious diseases: &quot;We are looking at our capability but we are very confident that we have very good people in the NHS, very experienced people, who will be ready to deal with anything if it were to arrive in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the Department for International Development announced a &pound;2m aid package to be made available immediately to partners, including the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) that are operating in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European commission yesterday said it would allocate an additional euros 2m (&pound;1.6m) to help contain the spread of the disease. &quot;The level of contamination on the ground is extremely worrying and we need to scale up our action before many more lives are lost,&quot; said Kristalina Georgieva, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money will be channelled through the World Health Organisation (WHO), MSF and the IFRC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific adviser, said it was important to be prepared. &quot;The government is keeping a close eye on the outbreak and we are well prepared,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No cases of imported Ebola have ever been reported in the UK. The risk to a traveller going to west Africa of contracting Ebola is very low but the chief medical officer has alerted medical practitioners about the situation in west Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview published in Tuesday's Daily Telegraph, he said the disease was &quot;potentially a major threat&quot; to the UK because of the increasingly &quot;interconnected&quot; nature of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the paper: &quot;The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species. They are a potential major threat to us. Emerging infectious disease is a global grand challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were lucky with Sars. But we have to do the best horizon scanning. We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man was tested for Ebola in Britain this week but the result was negative. The Department of Health said he was checked in Birmingham after he reportedly travelled from Benin to Nigeria via Paris to the Midlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another man contacted Charing Cross hospital in London over fears he had the virus, but doctors ruled it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health professionals have been warned to be vigilant for signs of the virus and Public Health England has briefed border officials and airport staff on the symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers tackling the outbreak in west Africa have been especially vulnerable. Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, who was treating patients in Sierra Leone, died on Tuesday after being quarantined in hospital in the country. Two American health workers - a doctor and a missionary - are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease, prompting two US missionary groups to evacuate non-essential personnel from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pan-African airline Asky suspended all flights to and from the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the Liberian Football Association said it halted all activities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is believed to have killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began in February, according to the WHO. The disease has no known cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus is transmitted through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, sweat, blood and saliva, even after death. Confirmed cases are first quarantined before undergoing intensive rehydration therapy. It can take up to 21 days for symptoms to show. They include vomiting, diarrhoea, internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is one of the scariest diseases on the planet, with its sudden onset, horrific symptoms and the need for doctors and nurses to wear protective clothing. But in spite of the numbers of cases in west Africa and the apparent alarming pronouncements, the threat to Britain is considered very low.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments to the Daily Telegraph by Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific officer, under a front page headline warning that an &quot;outbreak of deadly Ebola virus could reach UK&quot; came from an interview he gave the paper several weeks ago about the global spread of all sorts of infectious diseases. The urgent letters sent to GPs that excited the Daily Mail went out on 2 July and were routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seriousness of Ebola in west Africa, where infection control and health systems are far from adequate, should not be downplayed. But, as our experience with Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) showed, Britain has highly responsive systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flu is a danger to every country because it is spread through water droplets in the air, so coughs and sneezes spread the disease. But Ebola is transmitted via physical contact with the bodily fluids. It appears people are not infectious until they have symptoms - then the danger is from blood, saliva, urine and diarrhoea. Their clothes, their bedding, needles and any other surfaces in contact with bodily fluids will also carry the virus, hence the need for body suits and face masks for nursing staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family, nursing somebody who is sick or burying their body, is at extreme risk. So are all health workers - hospitals are the major incubation points for this disease. Teams of doctors and experts from the World Health Organisation and Medecins Sans Frontieres have rushed to try to contain the outbreaks and educate the population, urging them to notify health workers if somebody becomes ill. Reports that 90% of people die have not helped and are not accurate - with intravenous fluids, patients with strong immune systems can fight off the virus, and the death rate has been closer to 50% in some places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People do not show symptoms for two to 21 days after infection, so clearly there is the possibility that someone with Ebola could get on a plane and land in London. It is unlikely other people would be infected on the plane - one man flew from Liberia to Lagos in Nigeria, where he became ill, but no other passenger appears to have contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border control staff have been warned of the symptoms. Those are rapid and serious. If the patient had recently been in west Africa, Ebola would have to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe and north America, infection control measures would rapidly be put in place. The sick person would be isolated in hospital and every contact would be traced. Those people in turn would be quarantined in case they developed symptoms. It happened with Mers, where a man from Qatar died in a London hospital. Experts from the Health Protection Agency followed up over 60 people who had come into contact with him and traced more than 100 others who had had contact with his family. None had picked up the virus - but the reassuring part is the efficiency of the tracing process in the UK. Sadly, in west Africa, that sort of effort is nearly impossible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is one of the scariest diseases on the planet, with its sudden onset, horrific symptoms and the need for doctors and nurses to wear protective clothing. But in spite of the climbing numbers of cases in west Africa and the apparent alarming pronouncements of prominent individuals in the UK, the threat to this country is considered very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments to the Daily Telegraph of Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific officer, under a front page headline warning that an &quot;outbreak of deadly Ebola virus could reach UK&quot; came from an interview he gave the paper several weeks ago about the global spread of all sorts of infectious diseases.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seriousness of Ebola in west Africa, where infection control and health systems are far from adequate, should not be downplayed. But, as our experience with Mers (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) showed, the UK has highly responsive systems that swing into place if there is an threat of a new infection arriving here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flu is a massive danger to every country because it is spread through water droplets in the air, so coughs and sneezes spread the disease. But Ebola is transmitted via physical contact with the bodily fluids of somebody who has fallen sick. It appears that they are not infectious until they have symptoms - and then the danger is from blood (and they haemorrhage so there is a lot of it), saliva, urine and diarrhoea. Their clothes, their bedding, needles and any other surfaces in contact with bodily fluids will also carry the virus, hence the need for full body suits and face masks for nursing staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a village in Sierra Leone or Guinea, the dangers are clear. The family, nursing somebody who is sick or burying their body, is at extreme risk. So are all health workers - hospitals are the major incubation points for this disease.

It is unlikely other people would be infected on the plane - one man flew from Liberia to Lagos in Nigeria, where he became ill, but no other passenger appears to have contracted the disease. But airlines flying out of west Africa are likely now to be warning their staff of the symptoms, just in case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If somebody with the virus in their body but not yet ill arrived at a UK airport, they would not be detected - who would know? But border control staff have been warned of the symptoms expected of those who fall ill. Those are rapid and serious, which means that doctors would be called in immediately. If the patient had recently been in west Africa, Ebola would have to be considered as a possibility and every precaution taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe and north America, infection control measures are stringent and would rapidly be put in place. The sick person would be isolated in hospital and every contact would be traced. Those people in turn would be quarantined in case they developed symptoms. It happened with Mers, where a man from Qatar died in a London hospital. Experts from the Health Protection Agency, now part of Public Health England, followed up over 60 people who had come into contact with him and traced more than 100 others who had had contact with his family. None had picked up the virus - but the reassuring part is the efficiency of the tracing process in the UK. Sadly, in west Africa, that sort of effort is presently nearly impossible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a hospital somewhere in a rural part of sub-Saharan Africa, a patient presents with an unknown disease. That sounds more dramatic than it would appear on the ground - the patient has a fever, perhaps a headache, perhaps nausea, symptoms that could mean anything. Most of the time it will be one of the waterborne diseases that are rife in these poverty-stricken places. But in this case, it is something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola is a frightening disease that can kill as many as nine out of every 10 people infected. It is painful and horrible; it kills by making its victims bleed to death internally. There is no cure or vaccine. And right now, in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, it is killing people - 670 at least, at the time of writing, have died. More than 1,000 people have been infected in this outbreak, making it the world's worst ever: there have been only around 2,300 deaths in all the previous outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the time, the disease sits pretty harmlessly in fruit bat populations. But every so often, says Prof John Oxford, a virologist at the University of London, it makes an unlikely leap into humans. &quot;Perhaps someone eats bush meat, or comes into contact with bats. But then the virus makes it into a human body, and that human is pretty unlucky.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After about a week, you get a huge frontal headache, a high temperature, maybe a rash. Then a few days later you get nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea - and then bleeding, from the eyes, from the mouth, from the backside.&quot; And from there, if you are left untreated, you will probably die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the men and women on the front line, the key is identifying the disease as early as possible. By the time an outbreak has been noticed, your best chance of containing it has long gone, says Prof Paul Hunter, a specialist in health protection at the University of East Anglia, who has dealt with outbreaks of infectious diseases in Congo and Sudan. Most doctors in Sierra Leone don't have equipment to do blood tests or other diagnostic procedures that would be straightforward in Western hospitals. &quot;The early symptoms are generic, so your judgment on whether the case in front of you is something dangerous depends on what's going on in the region - if there's been an outbreak of typhus, for instance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What that means, though, is that in those early, crucial days of an outbreak, things are much more difficult. Later on, Ebola is, in a gruesome way, easier to manage than some other diseases - the fact that it is a haemorrhagic fever, that it has this terrible but distinctive bleeding in its late stages, means that by the time the patient is dead, you probably know the cause. With other diseases, says Hunter, you could still be guessing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But once doctors know what they are dealing with, the question is how to stop it from spreading. And in one sense, we're lucky - as frightening and unpleasant as Ebola is, it is not, actually, very infectious. &quot;It doesn't spread very easily - it's not an airborne virus. You need to get close to fluids, such as blood or vomit,&quot; Oxford says. This means its &quot;reproductive number&quot; - how many people are infected, on average, by each carrier - is very low: about one, compared to 12 for measles. What's more, it's not very hardy. &quot;We know it as a filovirus - not a typical virus, which looks like a kind of tiny football, but this extraordinary-looking thread, like a piece of cotton.&quot; Simply washing one's hands destroys the long, fragile virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trouble is that Ebola, as mentioned, is both hard to diagnose in its early stages, and frightening. &quot;It's not easy to tell that you've got Ebola. If you present at a hospital in west Africa with vomiting, you'll probably be diagnosed as having cholera,&quot; says Oxford. &quot;So nurses and doctors won't take appropriate precautions and will become infected.&quot; And once a case has been detected, it terrifies people. &quot;A lot of hospital staff abscond when the diagnosis is made,&quot; Hunter says. &quot;And lots of people who were on the plane with the first man who died in Nigeria have absconded, because they didn't want to be quarantined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local practices in the affected regions do not help to slow the disease. The Ebola virus can survive for several days outside the body, and in much of west Africa it is common at funerals to touch the skin of the deceased. In a haemorraghic fever victim, that means the skin will be covered with the still infectious virus that killed them. &quot;If you touch the person's face or something, and then touch your eyes or mouth without first having washed your hands, you could be infected,&quot; Oxford says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is keen that the World Health Organisation and other groups work with local religious leaders and faith healers - &quot;it might be odd, a professor of virology saying that, but they are the ones people trust&quot;. The trust in Western medicine, sadly, is lacking. &quot;When I was in east Africa, all sorts of rumours were flying around when we tried to get blood samples - it's a Western plot to give us HIV/Aids, that sort of thing,&quot; Hunter says. He refers to a terrible case in 2008, when French aid workers took babies out of Chad. &quot;That played very badly - people said, you have to be careful with white people, they want to steal your babies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Tim Jagatic is a Canadian doctor with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res, who has just come back to Europe after facing the outbreak in Sierra Leone. &quot;The 'hospital' is a group of tents in a clearing in the jungle, away from the population to reduce the risk,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a low-resource setting, just doing basic medicine: hydration, nutrition, fever control, promoting hygiene.&quot; But even with such limited tools, his team has brought the death rate of patients down from around 90 per cent to below 60 per cent, at some risk to themselves (&quot;There is a sense of - not fear, but precaution. If you don't pay attention, you do put yourself at risk&quot;). And, equally importantly, he is addressing the two problems of poor disease control and the lack of trust. &quot;What we're doing is gaining trust, dispelling rumours - showing that we're not here to steal organs or take blood, we're providing food, providing medicine.&quot; And they're promoting the basic hygiene that will stop the next outbreak: &quot;They go away knowing to wash their hands, and they tell their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All three men agree that the risk of the disease making it to Britain is slim, and if it does, the methods of hygiene applied in Western hospitals would ensure that it didn't spread far. But the thought of the disease in Europe or America is instructive. &quot;If there was a disease in the UK with a similar mortality rate and risk of spread, potential new treatments would be made available,&quot; says Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine and the head of the medical charity the Wellcome Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has pointed out in the past that the response to Ebola is essentially the same now as it was when it was first noticed in 1976 in Zaire and Sudan: a response he calls &quot;shut you away and bury you nicely&quot;. The sporadic nature of the disease and the fact that it survives in bats between outbreaks makes it harder to come up with vaccines and cures, but the fact that it is exclusively a disease of sub-Saharan Africa means that the urge even to try has been disgracefully lacking in the West. There is still much to learn about the disease: for example, Farrar points out, the mortality rate of this outbreak, though still high, is lower than we normally expect, and we don't know why. (The lower mortality rate may be the reason this year's outbreak has spread so widely and rapidly: normally Ebola kills its victims too quickly for it to spread to many people.) In general, the way the virus behaves in the human body is poorly understood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps that will change in the future. But for now, Oxford says, &quot;it's all about calming people down&quot;. The current outbreak will die out relatively soon, he says, because the various governments have started to take steps - quarantining, improved hygiene, altered funeral practices - that will break the chain of infection. And, as unexciting as it sounds, the way the disease will be defeated will probably not be marvellous medical breakthroughs, but getting more people to wash their hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disease, which can be fatal for up to 90 per cent of infected victims, has killed more than 670 people in an outbreak across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Health England issued an urgent warning to doctors to watch for signs of the disease after an infected man was allowed to travel through an international hub. Offi-cials said the virus was &quot;clearly not under control&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with The Daily Telegraph Sir Mark Walport, the Government's chief scientific adviser, said the increasingly &quot;interconnected&quot; world was placing Britons at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The UK is fortunate in its geographical position. We're an island,&quot; he said. &quot;But we are living in a completely interconnected world where disruptions in countries far away will have major impacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species. They are a potential major threat to us. Emerging infectious disease is a global grand challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were lucky with Sars. But we have to do the best horizon scanning. We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Government is keeping a close eye on the Ebola outbreak and they will be prepared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola has never been reported in the UK and the risk of travellers in west Africa contracting the disease was &quot;very low&quot;, Sir Mark said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However the death of an American, Patrick Sawyer, in Lagos, Nigeria, has led to fears that the virus could spread beyond Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Sawyer, 40, had travelled from his home of Minnesota to attend the funeral of his sister, who died from Ebola. It is unclear how he was allowed to board multiple flights. Despite vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea, the employee in the Liberian finance ministry was able to fly from Liberia, via Ghana, and Togo, before arriving in Nigeria, where he died. Experts say he could have passed on the disease to anyone sitting near him or who used the same plane lavatory. They are now trying to trace fellow passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday Asky Airlines, which Mr Sawyer used for his flights, said it was suspending flights to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. The World Health Organisation is considering closing the borders to infected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England, said the Ebola outbreak was being closely monitored. &quot;It is the largest outbreak of this disease to date, and it's clear it is not under control,&quot; he said. &quot;We have alerted UK medical practitioners in west Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government agency is reviewing its advice to decide whether to raise the risk level. The closest the disease has come to Britain was in the 1990s when a veterinarian travelled to Switzerland while infected. The disease was caught early by doctors and she was treated before she passed on the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor David Heymann, of the Centre on Global Health Security at Chatham House, London, said it was difficult to stop infected travellers moving around the world if they kept symptoms hidden. &quot;The best thing would be if people did not travel when they were sick, but the problem is people won't say when they're sick. They will lie in order to travel, so it is doubtful travel recommendations would have a big impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The important thing is for countries to be prepared when they get patients infected with Ebola, that they are isolated, family members are told what to do and health workers take the right steps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday Sheik Umar Khan, the head doctor fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone, died from the disease, less than a week after he contracted it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The curse of Ebola: Page 15</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola virus How it spread to humans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks - in Nzara, Sudan, and in Yambuku, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The latter was in a village situated near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is introduced into the human population through close contact with the sweat, blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus then spreads in the community through human-to-human transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symptoms begin with fever, muscle pain and a sore throat, then rapidly escalate to vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period can be up to 21 days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is the largest outbreak of this disease to date, and it's clear it is not under control, &quot; said Dr McCloskey. &quot;We have alerted UK medical practitioners about the situation in west Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government agency is reviewing its advice to decide whether to raise the risk level. The closest the disease has come to Britain was in the Nineties when a veterinarian travelled to Switzerland while infected. The disease was caught early by doctors and she was treated before she passed on the virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief scientific adviser says virus, which has killed 672 people since February, is potentially a major threat to UK</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, is to chair an emergency Cobra meeting amid warnings that the deadly Ebola virus could be a threat to Britain, although health experts said the country was well prepared to deal with any potential cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammond said no British national so far had been affected by the outbreak and there had been no cases in the UK but he would be chairing a meeting to assess the situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as we are aware, there are no British nationals so far affected by this outbreak and certainly no cases in the UK. However, the prime minister does regard it as a very serious threat and I will be chairing a Cobra meeting later today to assess the situation and look at any measures that we need to take either in the UK, or in our diplomatic posts abroad in order to manage the threat,&quot; he told Sky News. &quot;We are very much focused on it as a new and emerging threat which we need to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As concern mounts over the worst Ebola outbreak yet recorded, the European commission said it would allocate an additional (EURO)2m ([#xfffd]1.6m) - on top of (EURO)1.9m - to help contain the spread of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of contamination on the ground is extremely worrying and we need to scale up our action before many more lives are lost,&quot; said Kristalina Georgieva, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money will be channelled through the World Health Organisation, MSF and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific adviser, said it was important to be prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is keeping a close eye on the Ebola outbreak and we are well prepared,&quot; he said. &quot;No cases of imported Ebola have ever been reported in the UK. The risk to a traveller going to west Africa of contracting Ebola is very low but the chief medical officer has alerted medical practitioners about the situation in west Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview published in Tuesday's Daily Telegraph, he said the disease was &quot;potentially a major threat&quot; to the UK because the increasingly &quot;interconnected&quot; nature of the world meant disruptions in far-off countries could have a major impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the paper: &quot;The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species. They are a potential major threat to us. Emerging infectious disease is a global grand challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were lucky with Sars. But we have to do the best horizon scanning. We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man was tested for Ebola in the UK earlier this week, but was found negative. The Department of Health said he was checked in Birmingham after he reportedly travelled from Benin to Nigeria via Paris to the Midlands. Meanwhile, another man contacted Charing Cross hospital in London over fears he had the virus, but doctors ruled out the need for an Ebola test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health professionals have been warned to be vigilant for signs of the virus and Public Health England has briefed border officials and airport staff on the symptoms. It has issued an urgent warning to doctors after an infected man was able to make several flights from Liberia to Nigeria, where he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers tackling the outbreak in the region have been especially vulnerable to contracting the disease. Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, who was treating patients in Sierra Leone, died on Tuesday after being quarantined in hospital in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two American health workers - a doctor and a missionary - are also in hospital in neighbouring Liberia after contracting the disease, prompting two US missionary groups to evacuate non-essential personnel from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pan-African airline ASKY suspended all flights to and from the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone and the Liberian Football Association said it halted all activities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LFA decided &quot;to cease operations of football activities considering that football matches are contact sports and Ebola is spread through body contacts with an infected person&quot;, the LFA chief, Musa Bility, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the finance ministry in Liberia, where 127 people have died of the disease, said it had placed several senior officials under observation for three weeks after a leading ministry official died from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is believed to have killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began in February, according to the WHO. The contagious disease, which has a fatality rate of 90%, has no known cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus is transmitted through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, sweat, blood and saliva, even after death. Confirmed cases are first quarantined before undergoing intensive rehydration therapy. It can take up to 21 days for symptoms to show.They include vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its risk assessmentfor Britons, PHE said: &quot;Increasing case numbers and extended geographical spread may increase the risk for UK citizens engaged in humanitarian aid and healthcare delivery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DH official added: &quot;Protecting the public from infectious diseases is a priority and we lead the world in this field. We are well prepared to identify and deal with any potential cases of Ebola, though there has never been a case in this country. Any patients with suspected symptoms can be diagnosed within 24 hours and they would also be isolated at a dedicated unit to keep the public safe. Our specialist staff are also working with the World Health Organisation to help tackle the outbreak in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest efforts come as senior western officials held meetings to assess the risk of ebola reaching their shores</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia shut down schools and many markets, placed all non-essential public servants on leave and quarantined several communities in the most stringent bid yet to curb an Ebola epidemic that has raged for seven months across three west African nations. A Liberian civil servant who last week died after flying to Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, brought the total number of countries hit by the deadly and contagious pathogen to four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest efforts come as senior western officials, including from the US and UK, held meetings to assess the risk of ebola reaching their shores, although experts say any outbreak there is likely to be far easier to contain. Sawyer, who carried dual American and Liberian nationality, had been due to travel to the US for his daughters' birthday next month, his wife told CNN.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several rural communities - where many view Ebola with much the same terror and misunderstanding as westerners did when the Aids epidemic began - are to be quarantined, with food supplies and medical support ferried in by only approved persons, authorities said. All public facilities will be chlorinated and disinfected on Friday, and public gatherings have already been banned. The strict measures echo those that allowed Uganda to rapidly shut down an outbreak in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a dire situation. The spread is overwhelming health workers and facilities. We need all the help and support we can get from the international community,&quot; Lewis Brown, Liberia's information minister, told the Guardian. He said communities most hard hit by the virus would be quarantined for as long as necessary, with security forces enforcing the plan. &quot;It's an emergency, so we hope people will understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors today began away patients at one of Liberia's main ebola isolation wards, with up to 20 patients awaiting treatment at home. Some residents in Monrovia initially protested against a new ward being set up, fearing it would endanger them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spread by contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, bush meat or surfaces, Ebola has killed 672 people since it originated in Guinea, the impoverished west African nation. Health officials took several weeks to pinpoint the origin of the disease to a remote village in the country's forest hinterlands, by which time it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Authorities in all three nations have since faced a battle to win over terrified residents, as well as curb traditions that involve contact with victims' contagious corpses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some campaigns have shown signs of working. Sylvia Johnson, a resident in the capital Monrovia, pulled her grandson out of summer school at the beginning of the week after seeing a government-printed poster of graphic corpses of ebola victims, who frequently die from both internal and external haemorrhaging. &quot;He cried, but no child will control me. It will be better for him to live and attend many more vacation schools than get sick from Ebola,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian authorities also mobilised unusually swiftly, underlying their concern about an outbreak in the continent's most populous nation and major commerce hub. Police and health workers began printing information leaflets, including in widely-spoken pidgin English. The country's main carrier, Arik Air, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while international airports and seaports have been placed on red alert, and passengers are being monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has chaired an emergency Cobra meeting amid warnings that the deadly Ebola virus could be a threat to Britain, although health experts said the country was well prepared to deal with any potential cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammond said no British national so far had been affected by the outbreak and there had been no cases in the UK but he chaired the meeting to assess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK announced a new &pound;2m package of assistance will be made available immediately to partners including the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res that are operating in Sierra Leone and Liberia to tackle the outbreak. The European commission said it would allocate an additional (EURO)2m (&pound;1.6m) - on top of (EURO)1.9m (&pound;1.5m) - to help contain the spread of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of contamination on the ground is extremely worrying and we need to scale up our action before many more lives are lost,&quot; said Kristalina Georgieva, EU commissioner for humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey conducted by the INQUIRER has revealed that some businesses are profiteering over the sale of some disinfectants that are being used as anti-Ebola materials. The prices of alcohol, soap, buckets, disinfectants such as chlorine, face mask latex glove among others have skyrocketed in recent time since it was announced that they play a greater role in combating the spread of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some unscrupulous business houses are also selling detergent soaps and other materials that are capable of combating the spread of the deadly Ebola virus are sold at higher prices sometimes twice the amount they were originally sold for prior to the outbreak of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From supermarket to another, prices of these commodities have been increased on ground that more people are buying them in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A housewife told the INQUIRER that since it was made public that those disinfectants and other consumable household goods are helpful in combating the Ebola virus, the sellers continue to increase prices sometime at the rate of 100 percent to the detriment of the already poor and fatigued consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government must act to stop this ugly situation because it is leading to more hardship on the people and sometimes bigger traders use the petty traders to increase the price,&quot; a consumer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the petty traders who spoke to this paper yesterday said they have no control over the increase in prices because it is those importers who are increasing the prices of these materials on ground that there is no price control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latex Gloves were seen being sold at every street corner of Monrovia for the third day running and a consumer noted that the price of gloves continue to increase by the days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent reaction to the situation yesterday, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry said it has been informed of some unscrupulous business houses engaged in price hiking and supply manipulation of chlorine, latex gloves, face masks and other materials used to combat spread of Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry in a release said it considers this act with grave concern and intends to penalize any business house involved in such practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Commerce and Industry release which was signed by Mr. Mitchell Jones, Director of Communications and approved by Mr. Cyril Allen II, Deputy Minister and Officer In Charge, informed the general public that several actions have been taken to help curtail the profiteering act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry named some of these actions as the random inspection of business houses including price verification of import invoices and the random inspection of warehouses including verification of warehouse inventories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help with this process, the public has been encouraged to report such behaviors by calling the Ministry of Commerce Hotline at Libtelco: 020721 5043/02072155058 LoneStar: 0886559224/0886516171.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry noted that those found in violation of the business law will face serious penalties including fines not to exceed US$25,000, revocation of business license, seizure and auctioning of goods, etc. and in some instances, may be referred to the Ministry of Justice for charges of criminal offense under the penal code of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ministry takes this offense very seriously and will deal with it to the full extent of the law. We are in a crisis and the Ministry expects and demands responsible behavior from all stakeholders. The private sector support and cooperation are absolutely essential in the fight against the spread of Ebola. Join the fight,&quot; the release concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's share of 21st Century Modernization has partly come in pervasive moral decadence, mediocrity and violence marvelling old folks who often assert that probity, hard work and diligence have since gone on sabbatical. In fact one pundit opined the other day that Liberia was confronted with two kinds of AIDS: the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and the Acquired Integrity Delinquency System (AIDS). As if the President of the Southeast-based Tubman University has also closely been following, and overwhelmed, by massive integrity deficit in the country, she made the centrepiece of her oration as the 167th Independence Day speaker issues of value system, integrity and transformation. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are three levels at which transformation of attitudes and behaviours must occur. It is imperative that each level reinforces the other,&quot; Elizabeth Davis-Russell, President of Tubman University said Saturday, July 26, as chief orator of the country's 167th Independence Anniversary. And she named the three levels as Family, Education and Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the theme, &quot;Transformation of Our Minds, Attitudes and Behaviours&quot;, Dr. Russell said: &quot;We must eschew dishonesty and corruption and imbed integrity in all of our actions, no matter how small. Public servants/ civil servants should not ask for money or favours under the table to do the people's work.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said citizens' interactions with one another should be characterized by civility, adding, &quot;We may disagree, but we do not have to be disagreeable. Ethical behaviour should be the norm rather than the exception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TU President further asserted: &quot;Love of nation should supersede ethnicity and other affiliations that are used to divide; each child must learn what it means to be a citizen; with all of the rights, privileges, obligations, and responsibilities. They should not mouth the national anthem and other national symbols without fully understanding what they mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must all truly understand that in order for Liberia to succeed each one must do his/her duty regardless of what it is, because others depend upon us. We cannot afford to have bench warmers, that is people who sit in offices or under trees and do nothing but collect a pay check.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian educator maintained that Liberia cannot afford to have minimalists, those who perform the least of what is expected and nothing more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We must examine our labour laws that permit those minimalists to work the system by working only 15 days a month knowing that they will get a pay check for the whole month. We need workers who demonstrate the value and passion for work. Therefore dependability and trustworthiness must be the new order of the day and every day. We must practice personal responsibility instead of trying to pass blame for not doing what we were supposed to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change will not come easy, but we must remain steadfast and hold ourselves and others accountable. If we do not change, Liberia will become obsolete as the dinosaurs while others speed by. Let us remember the words of the national songs which proclaim a new day. We can truly become &quot;one people, one nation, united for peace and sustainable development&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf remarks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the Independence Day celebration was President Sirleaf who sounded somber, initially concentrating her remarks to the Ebola invasion of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the many challenges with which we are faced, we mark the 167th Independence Anniversary of our nation with solemn reflection,&quot; the President said. &quot;Even as we do, we must continue to give praise and thanks to the Almighty who continues to shower his manifold blessings and kind mercies upon us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said &quot;We celebrate this Anniversary with a difference, eschewing the many festivities in favor of prayers for our nation. Last Friday, July 18, and Sunday, July 20, Intercessory Prayers for the Nation were held throughout our land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President further asserted: &quot;On Wednesday, we witnessed the unthinkable when a man, angered over perceived neglect after his sister died of Ebola, decided to revenge by setting fire to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. This is how damaging this virus has become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how the risk and the danger now go beyond the virus. We understand the anger. But we cannot and will not accept burning buildings and attacking health care workers or facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another event, she said, &quot;one of our compatriots met his untimely death and put to risk others across borders because of indiscipline and disrespect for the advice which had been given by health workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She announced the establishment of a National Task Force on Ebola which she chairs and co-chaired by the Minister of Internal Affairs in his role as the Chairman of the National Disaster Relief Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the President, the Commission will now be reactivated and strengthened. &quot;We're going to be calling upon Women and Youth Organizations, Inter-Religious Council, Market and Labor Organizations, Political Parties Leaders, Traditional Leaders, and the Press Union to send us representatives to serve on this Task Force. Our task is to work with the Health Team and provide support and guidance to them. We also will be establishing a Community Outreach Force with individuals mobilized from each community to reach out to communities, to sensitize them to the disease to provide them information as to how they can protect themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southeast '26 Cancellation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President recalled that celebrating in the counties is a tradition began in 2006, intended to take events to the people, to encourage and expand infrastructural development, and to promote national healing and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should have been marking this Anniversary in the south eastern counties of Sinoe and Grand Kru,&quot; President Sirleaf said. &quot;However, we decided on a postponement to ensure that we are better prepared to give the best to our compatriots in Greenville and Barclayville, and the several other cities and communities, which are to benefit from the multiplying effects of hosting these celebrations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then she added: &quot;At the same time, we use this platform to remind ourselves that the celebrations are scheduled to take place in Maryland, River Gee and Grand Gedeh in 2015; and in River Cess, in 2016. Let us all begin the preparations for those counties right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverberating Keynote Speakers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have just heard a stirring National Oration, delivered by Dr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Davis-Russell, President of the William V.S. Tubman University, in Harper, Maryland County. She has called for the transformation of minds, attitudes and behaviors, as our nation rebuilds, observing that, in the face of competing priorities of infrastructure development, education, and healthcare, it is of the utmost importance to seriously focus on the human factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To bring about the transformation of our country, Dr. Davis-Russell has called for the family, education, and society to work in concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She invited us to look to our Constitution to restore some of the values upon which this new Liberia must be built. She also proposed a model of servant leadership, challenging the common practice of leadership that is often built upon self-aggrandizement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were the words of President Sirleaf on the keynote oration delivered by the President of the Tubman University. The President thanked her &quot;for this inspiring message to the Liberian people,&quot; before turning the challenges facing her administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President noted that by all accounts, 2014 has been a very difficult year. &quot;We have had a serious budget shortfall, depreciation in the exchange rate, flooding from climate change and other man-made interventions, the sharp decline in the price of rubber which has further offset the balance of trade, and more sadly the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has already claimed the lives of more than 100 of our countrymen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She however indicated that the productive sectors in large scale agriculture and mining have generally resolved land issues and are accelerating operations in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, she said, is on course to meet MDG Goal No 4 in recognition of the best record in reducing child mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect to meet the required number of indicators on our MCC Index ensuring our participation in President Obama's Power Africa Program. Landmark cases on human trafficking and corruption have been tackled and won by the Justice System. Additional communities are getting electricity and we expect the cost to go down when the HFO plants come on stream at the end of this year. Having concluded financing arrangements, we await the dry season to show significant progress in improving our air and sea ports and the continuation in the construction of primary roads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She reported that away from home, Liberia continues to enjoy goodwill and respect regionally and globally and &quot;we look forward to Liberia carrying out its role in the first ever historic United States - Africa Leaders Summit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the rapid spread of the deadly Ebola virus and the recent untimely death of Mr. Patrick Sawyer, Coordinator of the ECOWAS National Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, having contracted the virus, the Ministry wishes to announce the following measures to ensure public safety and instil confidence in users of services at the Ministry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very highest level of the Ministry, all senior officials coming in direct or indirect contact with Mr. Sawyer have been placed on the prescribed 21 days observatory surveillance period starting July 20th, the day Mr. Sawyer departed the country for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All concerned senior officials have been requested to telecommute up until when certified by the Ministry of Health to return to active duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further to this measure, the Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh has requested the Ministry of Health to immediately quarantine and properly sanitize both the former Ministry of Finance and the former Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs buildings including the newly constructed National Authorizing Office of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to these measures, the Ministry will be temporarily shut down 12: 00 PM on Monday, July 28, 2014 and reopened on Tuesday, July 29th, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All employees, who made no contact but have been traumatized as a result of the situation in the last few days and would like to take some time off, are free to stay home until when is necessary to return to duty. However, all essential employees still working at the Ministry are asked to observe the following measures strictly:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Use of the elevator is restricted to only 4 persons per trip; - Absolutely, no clustering on the stairways; - No gathering of more than five persons except for meetings in conference spaces or spatial environment; - Absolutely no handshakes, hugging of other physical bodily contact; - Please report any suspicious illness or strange conditions amongst employees; - Only persons with genuine business dealings and transactions would be permitted on the premises; - All employees are further encouraged to wear long sleeve clothing to minimize any possible risk of exposure;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these measures, the Ministry has put in place a thorough sanitary program and admonishes all staff to use the hand washer or personalized sanitizers or disposable gloves available at the Ministry's entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These measures take immediate effect as the MFDP treats this crisis seriously and will work to continue our support to ongoing national response effort. Consistent with the President's message and pledge, the MFDP, with support from our other partners, is committed to providing the full range of support required to address this situation in coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding, the general public is advised to carry out their normal transactional businesses at the Ministry and follow closely the measures announced in the interest of public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the MFPD tax policy unit will review, in conjunction with the Liberia Revenue Authority, a proposal for the relaxation of tariffs and duties on the importation of sanitary materials and other bleach products during the period of this situation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf says the year 2014 by all accounts has been a very difficult year; however, as unfortunate as the year has been so far, Liberians still have a lot to be thankful for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had a serious budget shortfall, depreciation in the exchange rate, flooding from climate change and other man-made interventions, the sharp decline in the price of rubber which has further offset the balance of trade, and more sadly the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has already claimed the lives of more than 100 of our countrymen,&quot; the Liberian leader enumerated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the hiccups facing the country, Liberians still have a lot to be thankful for, President Sirleaf said. &quot;The productive sectors in large scale agriculture and mining have generally resolved land issues and are accelerating operations. Liberia is on course to meet Millennium Development Goals - Goal No 4 in recognition of the best record in reducing child mortality,&quot; the Liberian leader catalogued, adding, &quot;We expect to meet the required number of indicators on our MCC Index ensuring our participation in President Obama's Power Africa Program. Landmark cases on human trafficking and corruption have been tackled and won by the Justice System. Additional communities are getting electricity and we expect the cost to go down when the HFO plants come on stream at the end of this year. Having concluded financing arrangements, we await the dry season to show significant progress in improving our air and sea ports and the continuation in the construction of primary roads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, President Sirleaf made the assertion in remarks at celebrations in observance of the 167th Independence Anniversary of Liberia at the Centennial Pavilion on July 26, 2014. This year's anniversary was held under the theme: &quot;One People, One Nation United for Peace and Sustainable Development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Ebola epidemic continues to claim the lives of many Liberians and possibly spiraling out of control, President Sirleaf, who had already declared the outbreak a national emergency, called on all Liberians to come together to fight the disease regardless of political, social, economic and religious persuasions; adding, &quot;We must show a deep sense of nationalism. We must reach across borders and join our brothers and sisters in the other neighboring countries that are affected to ensure continuing common response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader then announced the establishment of a National Task Force on Ebola which she will chair along with the Minister of Internal Affairs as Chairman of the National Disaster Relief Commission as co-chair. Other members of the Commission include: Women and Youth Organizations, Inter-Religious Council, Traditional Council, Labor Union, Market Organizations, Political Parties, Press Union, the Transport Unions, Motor Bikes Associations, to name a representative to participate on the Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force will give support to the Technical Team headed jointly by the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and the Country Representative of the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf also announced the establishment of a Community Outreach Force with individuals mobilized from each community to reach out to communities, to sensitize them to the disease to provide them information as to how they can be protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf again extended the Nation's deepest and official sympathy to the families of all those affected and afflicted by the virus, including the doctors, the National Health team, as well as the dedicated and sacrificial health workers. She committed Government's obligation to respond to them in their time of need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also seized the opportunity again to extend heartfelt sympathy to the family of the late Ugandan doctor, Sam Mutooro Muhumuza, who also succumbed to the virus. The late doctor's wife and elder brother, Mrs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dianna Mutooro and Rev. Jehoiada Mutooro, were in attendance at the Independence Day program where they were officially recognized and honored by the Liberian leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touching on the postponement of this year's Independence Anniversary celebration in the southeastern counties of Sinoe and Grand Kru, President Sirleaf reiterated that they decided on a postponement to ensure that they are better prepared to give the best to compatriots in Greenville and Barclayville, and the several other cities and communities, which were to benefit from the multiplying effects of hosting these celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She informed Liberians that the Independence Anniversary celebrations will take place in Maryland River Gee and Grand Gedeh Counties in 2015; and in River Cess County in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering the 167th Independence Day National Oration, Dr. Elizabeth Davis Russell proposed a transformation of minds, attitudes and behaviors, as Liberia rebuilds, observing that, in the face of competing priorities of infrastructure development, education and healthcare, it is of utmost importance to seriously focus on the human factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of the William V.S. Tubman University in Harper, Maryland County stressed that public and civil servants must take the lead and refrain from dishonesty. She urged Liberians to be moral in their performance, practice personal responsibility and avoid blaming others. &quot;We currently see too much emphasis on self-aggrandizement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is what I call the beating of the chest, followed by the question, do you know who I am with the expectation that we should pay homage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the approach should be. I am your public servant here to serve you. What can I do for you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I'm proposing is a change in the attitudes and behaviors of all of us who serve in the public. We are elected, appointed to serve and should do so willingly. We should be servant leaders,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Davis-Russell said if Liberia's development process must be sustained, compatriots must fight poor attitude and ensure excellence in Liberian schools and society. She stressed that Liberians must eschew corruption and dishonesty and learn to be tolerant even in disagreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must battle mediocrity, and set excellence as the standards in our schools, work places and in society generally. We must eschew dishonesty and corruption and imbed integrity in all of our actions no matter how small. Public servants, civil servants should not ask for money or favors under the table to do the people's work. Our interactions with one another should be characterized by civility. We can disagree but we do not have to be disagreeable,&quot; she emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the program, President Sirleaf, who is also Grand Master of the Orders of Distinction admitted the Independence Day Orator, Educator, Administrator, Psychologist and President of the William V.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tubman University, Dr. Elizabeth Davis Russell into the Star of Africa with the Grade of Grand Band.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educator, Lawyer, Administrator, Eminent Statesman and former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia, His Honor Cllr. Johnnie N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis was admitted into the Most Venerable Order of the Pioneers with the Grade of Knight Grand Commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the morning, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia officiated at the Military Inspection of Units and the March Pass-in-Review at the Barclay Training Center.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians are well known for being carefree at times with very serious matters. For instance when bullets rained on communities in the country during the civil conflict, there were those who rushed to scenes of the actions unarmed to see for themselves what was amiss. That reckless bravery has hardly changed since it was announced back in February that the Ebola pandemic had crossed into Liberia from neighbouring Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even despite reports the first batch of victims had passed on to the Great Beyond, many citizens simply laughed off the budding catastrophe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Government was yet still magnanimous, if not carefree, when it brushed aside suggestions to take tougher actions, including closing national borders. But as it is said in Liberia, the situation has reached &quot;A. T. AT&quot;--emergency proportions--and the Government appears awoke to the reality. To these dire times, President Sirleaf on Sunday, July 27th declared, following a serious meeting of stakeholders, a National Emergency along with all its stern measures; all aimed at pinning down the growing Ebola pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the ceaseless rains yesterday, national and international stakeholders, including the National Task Force and the Technical Team on Ebola, as well as other government officials, political leaders and others, cruised downtown and congregated to discuss ways to handle the deadly Ebola virus, which has already claimed scores of citizens and foreign nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Technical Team briefed attending stakeholders on the severity of the disease which has intensified in seven counties--Lofa, Montserrado, Bong, Nimba, Bomi Grand Gedeh and Margibi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarking at the meeting, President Sirleaf, who chairs the National Task Force, reiterated that, no doubt, the Ebola virus is a national health problem, asserting further that, &quot;Ebola, as we have also begun to see, attacks our way of life, with serious economic and social consequences. As such, we are compelled to bring the totality of our national resolve to fight this scourge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President along with stakeholders and partners agreed and announced a series of actions to address the magnitude of the emergency posed by the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the meeting, the first since the advent of Ebola, President Sirleaf declared that all borders of Liberia will be closed with the exception of major entry points including the Roberts International Airport, James Spriggs Payne Airport, Foya Crossing, Bo Waterside Crossing, Ganta Crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these entry points, preventive and testing centers will be established, and stringent preventive measures to be announced will be scrupulously adhered to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new travel policy by the Liberia Airport Authority covering inspection and testing of all outgoing and incoming passengers will be strictly observed, the President announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will also be restrictions on public gatherings such as solidarity marches, demonstrations, promotional advertisement are to be restricted and hotels, restaurants, entertainment centers and video clubs are to play five-minute film on Ebola awareness and prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the emergency action, the President said Government vehicles will be commandeered, as appropriate, to provide needed logistics support to the health delivery system and all government facilities and public places are to install and provide public access for washing of hands and other sanitization services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other actions announced by the President include media sensitization programs to be formulated by the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism; standing orders have been given to the Security Forces, including the Armed Forces of Liberia, to give support to the Technical Team and the Task Force in enforcing these regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President ordered that on report from the Technical Team, communities that are seriously affected will be quarantined and travels in and out of such communities restricted and support will be provided to those directly affected by the quarantine restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf further instructs that similar Task Force Structures are being established at the county level and that citizens outreach teams are being established to support the works of the Technical Team and the Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force appeals to the public to cooperate by refraining from harming or rejecting health workers and citizens' representatives who are only trying to save lives and protect citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the largest religious group in the country, the Liberia Council of Churches (LCC) has begun rallying its membership to join the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memo all pastors, bishops, general overseers, prophets, evangelists, and other ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the leader of LCC, Archbishop Dr. Jonathan B.B. Hart has announced an emergency meeting of its members to plan joining the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Hart stated in the Memo: &quot;The Liberian Council of Churches (LCC) wishes to invite ALL Pastors, Bishops, General Overseers, Prophets, Evangelists and Other Ministers of the Gospel to a specially-called emergency meeting of the Body of Christ in Liberia. The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, July 30, 2014 at 11:00AM at the St. Stephen Episcopal Church, 10th Street, Sinkor, Monrovia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Hart said in the memo that the LCC is working in collaboration with the Pentecostal Fellowship Union of Liberia, Liberia Fellowship of Full Gospel Ministers, Association of Evangelicals of Liberia, Prophetic Call to Ministers, Christian Community in Liberia, Apostolic World Christian Fellowship, among others to organize the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The purpose of the meeting is to discuss and consider an enhanced spiritual response by the church in Liberia to the prevailing EBOLA virus, among others,&quot; he said, urging members to &quot;be present and on time as the survival of our nation depends on the unity and intervention of the children of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1410 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was nothing unusual-looking about the passenger arriving at Heathrow from Lagos. He was carrying one of the most deadly diseases known to mankind, but it wasn't noticed by overstretched Nigerian airport officials before departure, nor by attendants on the flight, despite their special training to watch out for feverish passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Ebola is a disease that has an incubation period of between two and 21 days, it's more than likely that the final line of defence immigration staff at Heathrow failed to notice anything untoward about him either. It wasn't as if he was so unsteady or unwell that he couldn't answer basic questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so he was waved through. Little did anyone realise that his initial flu-like symptoms fever, headache, achy limbs, sore throat would soon become something much, much worse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola, a disease which is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and for which there is no vaccine and no known cure, was now in Britain for the first time. It would soon be spreading across the country, killing almost everyone it touched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately this is an imaginary situation, but an Ebola epidemic is the nightmare scenario which inspires Hollywood disaster movie writers and keeps public health officials awake at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there is now widespread alarm among experts that it could actually happen, because the deadly disease has spread for the first time from remote jungle villages to claim its first victim in Lagos, one of Africa's most sophisticated cities, with air links to major cities worldwide, including London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And woe betide anyone who comes in close contact with an Ebola victim. While the virus's one virtue is that it isn't as easily transmitted as, say, an airborne influenza, it is highly contagious if you come near enough to be infected by any sort of bodily fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means not only contamination from vomiting and diarrhoea the next stage after the fever and headaches but saliva from a kiss, sweat from a mopped brow, or even, it is thought, a sneeze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a sufferer is looked after by loved ones, only the most ruthless sanitation regime will save them. If he or she seeks medical help, risks could be even greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one British expert told me yesterday, if an Ebola victim was misdiagnosed and ended up being admitted to a normal hospital ward, the consequences would be disastrous' as nurses and doctors unwittingly passed the virus to other patients and colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final stages of the disease are hideously unpleasant as the virus punches holes in veins, often causing massive internal haemorrhaging and bleeding from the eyes, ears, mouth and other orifices. Death is generally caused by multiple organ failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as well, then, that no one ever gets Ebola beyond a handful of unlucky souls in the remote rural villages of equatorial West and Central Africa, where locals ignore warnings and still eat the fruit bats and monkeys that are the chief carriers of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least, that's what public health experts have been saying for years. Suddenly, though, they are changing their tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest outbreak of the disease is not only to be the worst ever by number of deaths, it has also been the first to spread to people living in major urban centres, including national capitals. The risk of it spreading across the world is now very real, experts warn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak started in Guinea in February, spreading to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the virus has infected more than 1,200 people, killing 672 of them so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cruel irony of Ebola is that those caring for its victims often contract the disease themselves. Recent casualties included one of Liberia's most respected doctors and two Americans thought to be Ebola's first Western victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ken Brantly was the medical director of a Christian aid charity, Samaritan's Purse, who had been working in Liberia since October. He contracted the disease despite wearing head-to-toe protective clothing while treating sufferers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Writebol, a Christian missionary, had also been working with Ebola victims in the Liberian capital of Monrovia when she became infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brantly, at least, may yet defy Ebola's grim statistics. Early treatment improves a patient's chances of survival, and he recognised his own symptoms and got immediate care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife and two young children were with him in Liberia until flying home to the U.S. a few weeks ago, but they have not yet shown any signs of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Liberia took the drastic step of closing its borders but it may be already too late. In Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, a Liberian man who tested positive for Ebola died on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Sawyer, a civil servant, collapsed at Lagos Airport as he returned from the funeral of his sister, who had also died from the disease. He changed plane in Togo and was vomiting on board, prompting fears the disease has already spread to a fifth country from just one outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's government says all ports of entry are on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is getting more and more scary,' conceded Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant health minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriorology at Aberdeen University, warns: If the disease gets going in Nigeria, it would be cause for concern. Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Pennington, an international expert, said yesterday that he was hardly reassured by current efforts to contain Ebola's spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a very big outbreak, and I get the feeling that whatever is being done to control it is not being done very well. Once you get a fairly large number of cases, it gets a momentum and becomes more and more difficult to control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is now crossing international borders.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Pennington, who criticised the UK government over its handling of mad cow disease, warned that Britain would be ill-equipped to cope with a sudden influx of Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isolating them is critical, he said, but ordinary hospitals simply don't have the facilities or the necessary highly trained staff. The specialist hospitals that dealt with such diseases have largely closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If [Ebola] came into London, I honestly don't know where they'd put the patients,' he said. We could cope with one or two, but more than that? Let's hope we don't have to.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big problem with Ebola, he stressed, is diagnosing it. The disease looks much like common flu until it's too late. Even the rash that sufferers get after about five days could be confused with other less serious ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola patients can often go under the radar, but if they ended up in hospital, giving blood samples and coughing over everyone, it would be potentially disastrous,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that it was crucial for British GPs and hospital doctors to start watching out for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If someone is coming in with flu-like symptoms, it's crucial to ask them where they've been and whether they've been to Africa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprisingly, scientists are still not clear exactly where Ebola comes from. The first known outbreak was in 1976 in a remote village near the Ebola river in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although most of the cases are understood to have been transmitted from human to human, each Ebola outbreak is initially caused by someone coming into contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected animal, such as a fruit bat, monkey or pig. (The bats are believed to carry the disease without being infected by it.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief cause is the popularity of bush meat' animals trapped in the wild. Bats and monkeys are frequently dried and then eaten without being cooked. Since bush meat is now being smuggled into London and Paris, scientists warn this could be another source of infection in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at Reading University, the disease is spreading so rapidly now because people are rescuing' Ebola sufferers from hospitals or snatching their dead bodies so they can wash them in accordance with religious custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first case of an infection in Sierra Leone, a hairdresser in Freetown, the capital, was forcibly removed from hospital by her family, sparking a frantic search to find her before she infected others. She died on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Neuman also fears officials in the UK may be hard-pressed to keep out every Ebola sufferer if their numbers become too great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to hope they do, though, as in the late stages of infection, you have enough virus in your body to infect everyone on Earth maybe three times over.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIBERIA became the latest West African country to seal its borders yesterday after the worst ever outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, which has claimed 670 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia, where 129 deaths have been reported, announced that all borders were being shut except for major entry posts and the airport. Two US doctors there have contracted the disease, which has a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation (WHO) is not recommending any travel restrictions to prevent spread of infection. International flights continue to depart from Liberia and other affected countries such as Guinea, where the outbreak began and 319 people have now died, and Sierra Leone, where there have been 224 victims so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials at airports in those three countries say they are checking for signs of fever in departing passengers. Sidie Yayah Tunis, a spokesman for Sierra Leone's health ministry, said buckets of chlorine were on hand for disinfection purposes at the airport in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International health experts say that such screening of passengers is difficult and ineffective, as in its early stages the disease shows similar signs to malaria, typhoid and other common illnesses - fever, muscle aches, weakness and vomiting. &quot;We would have to consider any travel recommendations very carefully, but the best way to stop this outbreak is to put the necessary measures in place at the source of infection,&quot; said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman. Closing borders &quot;might help but it won't be exhaustive or foolproof&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The risk of travellers contracting Ebola is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva. Ebola cannot be spread like flu, through casual contact or breathing in the same air, and patients are only contagious once the disease has progressed to the point where they show symptoms - by which stage they are often too sick to travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet in Nigeria, health officials are trying to trace anyone who may have come into contact with a Liberian man who died of Ebola after he travelled from his home country, via Togo, to Lagos, the most populous city in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patrick Sawyer, an official in the Liberian ministry of finance, collapsed on arrival at Lagos on July 20 and died several days later. His sister had recently died from the disease. Mr Sawyer fell ill on the plane, reportedly vomiting, and health workers were concerned that the disease could have spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hospital where Mr Sawyer died has been sealed off and shut for a week and staff who came into close contact with him have been isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jide Idris, the health commissioner for Lagos state, said: &quot;The decontamination process in all the affected areas has commenced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are currently no additional precautions at British airports, despite 117,000 Britons travelling to Nigeria each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Brian McCloskey, the director of global health at Public Health England, said: &quot;PHE's assessment of the risk to the UK from Ebola has not currently changed, and remains low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However, in the light of the continuing outbreak, we will be meeting to review our existing assessment shortly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most vulnerable people remain health care workers and relations who come into close contact with the sick.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities across west Africa announced a series of measures yesterday aimed at stopping the spread of the Ebola virus, which reached a fourth country last week with a death in Lagos, Africa's most populous city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria closed and quarantined the hospital where a man died on Friday in the country's first recorded case of the deadly and highly contagious pathogen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure of the clinic in one of the city's most densely populated districts came as police were called in to guard Sierra Leone's main Ebola treatment centre, while Liberia shut almost all its borders and banned public gatherings. Attempts to halt the world's biggest and most widespread outbreak of Ebola have been hampered by a lack of resources and poor understanding in a region which has never experienced an epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since it was first diagnosed in February. The pathogen is passed through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients or eating infected meat, and has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have shut the hospital to enable us to properly quarantine the environment. Some of the hospital staff who were in close contact with the victim have been isolated,&quot; Lagos state health commissioner Jide Idris said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities set up an isolation ward and began tracing those who had been in contact with Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old civil servant whose flight from his home in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, stopped over in Togo and Ghana. Some 60 contacts had been traced, including 44 health workers and 15 airport officials. Not all of the flight's passengers had been contacted as the airline had yet to provide a manifest, state officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derek Gatherer, a virologist at the University of Lancaster, said anyone on the plane near the infected man could be in &quot;pretty serious danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said Nigeria was richer than the other countries in the region, so could more easily mobilise resources to tackle an outbreak. &quot;Nigerians have deep pockets and they can do as much as any western country could do if they have the motivation and organisation to get it done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian and Nigerian airports and seaports began screening international arrivals for Ebola symptoms, which can take up to 21 days to appear. Arik Air, a major carrier for the region, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as travel peaks this week during the Muslim holiday of Eid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer is believed to have contacted the virus from his sister, who died of Ebola earlier this month. But his travelling despite not feeling well has angered many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of our compatriots met his untimely death and put to risk others across borders because of indiscipline and disrespect for the advice which had been given by health workers,&quot; Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said during the country's independence day celebrations on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She announced stringent new measures after two American volunteer doctors tested positive for Ebola, and the lead medical doctor at the country's largest hospital died. Samuel Brisbane had treated himself at home in an attempt not to infect other health workers, many of whom have been ostracised by their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, where 454 have died, angry crowds gathered outside Kenema hospital in the country's remote east, where dozens are receiving treatment for the virus, and threatened to burn it down and remove the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many communities have been left bewildered and angered by the deaths, and a belief that health workers living among the community are spreading the disease.</SPAN></P>

Named after the river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where one of the first villages to report cases in 1976 was located, Ebola is a severe viral illness that comes from direct contact with infected living or dead rainforest animals. It kills up to 90% of those infected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is it transmitted? The virus is passed via blood and body fluids, but also through bedsheets or surfaces a sick person has touched. The virus enters the body through broken skin or mucous membranes. The group at highest risk are health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the symptoms? Early signs are sudden fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. Vomiting and diarrhoea follow, and there can be both internal and external bleeding. Victims are infectious from the onset of symptoms, which start two to 21 days after they contract the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the treatment? Patients will need intensive supportive care, with intravenous fluids or oral rehydration salts. There are no drugs to treat the disease or vaccine to prevent it, although research is under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is there no cure? It has proved very hard to find drugs to treat viral diseases that cross to humans from animals. As with many of the so-called neglected tropical diseases, the lack of a potentially lucrative market makes drug companies reluctant to invest in research and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If outbreaks can be contained and stopped, why do they return? Ebola can be contained in human populations but the viral reservoir still exists in animals. There will always be a risk that hunters will kill infected animals and reintroduce it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will closing borders help? Borders are permeable in much of Africa. The World Health Organisation says closures may hinder travel and trade without detecting cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the rest of the world at risk? Clearly somebody infected with the virus could theoretically get on a plane and spark an outbreak anywhere in the world. However, with stringent infection control measures in more affluent countries it is probable the virus would be rapidly contained. Sarah Boseley</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities across west Africa announced a series of measures yesterday aimed at stopping the spread of the Ebola virus, which reached a fourth country last week with a death in Lagos, Africa's most populous city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria closed and quarantined the hospital where a man died on Friday in the country's first recorded case of the deadly and highly contagious pathogen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure of the clinic in one of the city's most densely populated districts came as police were called in to guard Sierra Leone's main Ebola treatment centre, while Liberia shut almost all its borders and banned public gatherings. Attempts to halt the world's biggest and most widespread outbreak of Ebola have been hampered by a lack of resources and poor understanding in a region which has never experienced an epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since it was first diagnosed in February. The pathogen is passed through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients or eating infected meat, and has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have shut the hospital to enable us to properly quarantine the environment. Some of the hospital staff who were in close contact with the victim have been isolated,&quot; Lagos state health commissioner Jide Idris said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities set up an isolation ward and began tracing those who had been in contact with Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old civil servant whose flight from his home in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, stopped over in Togo and Ghana. Some 60 contacts had been traced, including 44 health workers and 15 airport officials. Not all of the flight's passengers had been contacted as the airline had yet to provide a manifest, state officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derek Gatherer, a virologist at the University of Lancaster, said anyone on the plane near the infected man could be in &quot;pretty serious danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said Nigeria was richer than the other countries in the region, so could more easily mobilise resources to tackle an outbreak. &quot;Nigerians have deep pockets and they can do as much as any western country could do if they have the motivation and organisation to get it done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian and Nigerian airports and seaports began screening international arrivals for Ebola symptoms, which can take up to 21 days to appear. Arik Air, a major carrier for the region, has suspended flights between Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, as travel peaks this week during the Muslim holiday of Eid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer is believed to have contacted the virus from his sister, who died of Ebola earlier this month. But his travelling despite not feeling well has angered many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of our compatriots met his untimely death and put to risk others across borders because of indiscipline and disrespect for the advice which had been given by health workers,&quot; Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said during the country's independence day celebrations on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She announced stringent new measures after two American volunteer doctors tested positive for Ebola, and the lead medical doctor at the country's largest hospital died. Samuel Brisbane had treated himself at home in an attempt not to infect other health workers, many of whom have been ostracised by their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, where 454 have died, angry crowds gathered outside Kenema hospital in the country's remote east, where dozens are receiving treatment for the virus, and threatened to burn it down and remove the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many communities have been left bewildered and angered by the deaths, and a belief that health workers living among the community are spreading the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia, the Government of Liberia has taken several measures to contain the epidemic. At the first meeting of the Presidential Task Force set up and Chaired by President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf, government announced that all borders of Liberia will be closed with the exception of major entry points including the Roberts International Airport, James Spriggs Payne Airport, Foya Crossing, Bo Waterside Crossing and Ganta Crossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Government has also announced that at these entry points, preventive and testing centers will be established, and stringent preventive measures to be announced will be scrupulously adhered to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force has at the same time announced a new travel policy by the Liberia Airport Authority covering inspection and testing of all outgoing and incoming passengers will be strictly observed; that restrictions on public gatherings such as solidarity marches, demonstrations, promotional advertisements to be restricted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other measures include that hotels, restaurants, entertainment centers and video clubs are to play five-minute film on Ebola awareness and prevention; Government vehicles will be commandeered, as appropriate, to provide needed logistical support to the health delivery system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Government facilities and public places are to install and provide public access for washing of hands and other sanitization services; media sensitization programs to be formulated by the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, in the wake of the rapid spread of the deadly Ebola virus and the recent untimely death of Mr. Patrick Sawyer, Coordinator of the ECOWAS National Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, having contracted the virus, the Ministry wishes to announce the following measures to ensure public safety and instill confidence in users of services at the Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very highest level of the Ministry, all senior officials coming in direct or indirect contact with Mr. Sawyer have been placed on the prescribed 21 days observatory surveillance period starting July 20th, the day Mr. Sawyer departed the country for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All concerned senior officials have been requested to telecommute up until when certified by the Ministry of Health to return to active duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further to this measure, the Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh has requested the Ministry of Health to immediately quarantine and properly sanitize both the former Ministry of Finance and the former Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs buildings including the newly constructed National Authorizing Office of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to these measures, the Ministry will be temporarily shut down 12: 00 P.M. on Monday, July 28, 2014 and reopened on Tuesday, July 29, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All employees who made no contact but have been traumatized as a result of the situation in the past few days and would like to take some time off are free to stay home until when it's necessary to resume duty. However, all essential employees still working at the Ministry are asked to observe the following measures strictly:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of the elevator is restricted to only 4 persons per trip; absolutely, no clustering on the stairways; no gathering of more than five persons except for meetings in conference spaces or spatial environment; absolutely no handshakes, hugging of other physical bodily contact; report any suspicious illness or strange conditions amongst employees; only persons with genuine business dealings and transactions would be permitted on the premises; measures are all employees are further encouraged to wear long sleeve clothing to minimize any possible risk of exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these measures, the Ministry has put in place a thorough sanitary program and admonishes all staff to use the hand washer or personalized sanitizers or disposable gloves available at the Ministry's entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These measures take immediate effect as the MFDP treats this crisis seriously and will work to continue our support to ongoing national response effort. Consistent with the President's message and pledge, the MFDP, with support from our other partners, is committed to providing the full range of support required to address this situation in coming days,&quot; the release stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding, the general public is advised to carry out their normal transactional businesses at the Ministry and follow closely the measures announced in the interest of public health,&quot; the release added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the MFPD tax policy unit says it will review, in conjunction with the Liberia Revenue Authority, a proposal for the relaxation of tariffs and duties on the importation of sanitary materials and other bleach products during the period of this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing Orders have been given to the Security Forces, including the Armed Forces of Liberia, to give support to the Technical Team and the Task Force in enforcing these regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on report from the Technical Team, according to the Task Force, communities that are seriously affected will be quarantined and travels in and out of such communities restricted. Support will be provided to those directly affected by the quarantine restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, the government said similar Task Force Structures are being established at the county level; citizens outreach teams are being established to support the works of the Technical Team and the Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Task Force has called on all institutions named in the President's Independence Day Remarks including women and youth organizations, Inter-Religious Council, Traditional Council, Labor Union, Market Organizations, Political Parties, Press Union, the Transport Unions, and Motor Bikes Associations, to name a representative to participate on the Task Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force then appealed to the public to cooperate by refraining from harming or rejecting health workers and citizens' representatives who are only trying to save lives and protect citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, report from the General Services Agency says some employees of the entity have been advised to stay away for a period of one month for some preventive measures against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures according to information are intended to put into place some preventive measures to protect employees against Ebola which is claiming lives in the country, a unanimous source told our reporter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian National Red Cross says the current spread of the deadly Ebola virus is escalating and warned that efforts be multiplied to urgently contain it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary General of the Liberian Red Cross Fayiah Tamba has said that the latest confirmation from Bong and Bomi is an evident that the spread of the virus is now rapid and troubling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tamba however warned the public to do away with the concept of denial and follow all precautionary measures including regular hand washing and avoiding close contact with sick persons suspected of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the Red Cross will continue to scale up its vigorous operation in the seven counties including Bong and Bomi where Ebola cases have been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross is complementing government effort in the areas ofsocial mobilization and awareness, contact Tracing, psychosocial counseling and providing survivor kits to victims since the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross in addition to its services has agreed to assist the ministry of Health in the area of dead body management and burial of Ebola victims in Montserrado for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Liberian Red Cross has welcomed the latest move by the Government to close all borders except the Roberts International Airport, James Spriggs Payne Airport, Foya Crossing, Bo Waterside Crossing and Ganta Crossing where preventive and testing centers will be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LNRCS Secretary General however called on the Government and its partners to pay more attention to protecting health Care workers who are the front liners in this fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Tamba, if the health workers are protected, we will regain their confidence to return to the various Health facilities that are currently abandoned across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of Ebola can occur through direct contact with the blood, secretion, or other body fluid of an infected person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is now the largest in history with more than one thousand cases and 660-deaths while more than 240 of the cases and 127-deaths occurred in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, the Liberia Refining Company (&quot;LPRC&quot;) Board of Directors met in an extraordinary session, and resolved to take positive and direct action aimed at curbing the alarming rise of cases of Ebola in Liberia. We made specific reference to health workers who are sacrificing at the front lines of this battle; and who desperately need and deserve the full support of us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In buttressing the efforts of the National Ebola Task Force recently set up by our President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the LPRC Family is presenting $75,000 United States Dollars as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility to be used for preventive gears such as face masks, body suits, latex gloves, foot and head wears for our health workers at medical facilities throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LPRC calls upon on all businesses in the Public and Private sectors, churches, mosques, civil society organizations, women, men and youth groups, political parties and all well meaning Liberians and foreign partners, to join this fight, which is one of national priority. We encourage everyone to unite in this fight, and caution all to take preventive measures, providing awareness and reporting all suspected cases to the nearest medical facility. This is the time for us to be our brothers' keepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our efforts to provide additional awareness, the LPRC Public Relations and medical teams have been mandated to engage in a massive public awareness campaign beginning at the LPRC Headquarters and extending to various communities on Tuesday, July 29, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LPRC Family offers special prayers for the families, relatives and friends of all who have lost loved ones to the Ebola epidemic, and pray that the Almighty God comforts and protects them during this time of their bereavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May the Mercy of God, through his Son Jesus Christ heal this land and provide total restoration to our Nation and peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our National Anthem rallies us to unite &quot;with hearts and hands our country's cause defending... &quot; and to &quot;meet the foe (Ebola) with valor unpretending&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians must unite and fight Ebola now! vIn union strong success is sure We cannot fail!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the news of the second outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia, many have expressed fear of going to the hospitals or clinics for medical treatment as several health workers are escaping from there, due to the rapid spread of the virus. The virus has in recent times killed several health workers in the country and other top Liberian Government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians have now resorted to going to Pharmacies to purchase essential drugs for their families to avoid any contact with others or being considered as Ebola patients whenever they are admitted or visit hospitals or clinics for medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes in the wake of nurses and other health workers' alleged refusal to report to work due to fear of the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. Recently, it was reported that nurses at Liberia's biggest hospital, the John F. Kennedy Medical Center are refusing to continue work as death toll continues to increase from the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia. It was also reported that the Emergency section at JFK has been shut down, while a small team of health care workers and patients have been located to another floor in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also reported that the ER will remain closed until it is sprayed thoroughly and quarantined for 21 incubation period. Nurses and doctors are being advised by family, friends and loved ones to stay away from the hospital until the Ebola epidemic subsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has killed some top Medical Doctors in Liberia including Dr. Samuel Brisbane, a former Chief Medical Doctor at the Firestone Rubber Plantation Hospital and a Physician Assistant who died from the virus on Saturday. It has been reported that Doctors at both JFK and Phebe Hospitals are currently quarantined at the ELWA Hospital in Paynesville where health practitioners from the Samaritan Purse have been working around the clock to treat serious cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation has indeed created serious fear amongst Liberians to the extent that many of the citizens have resorted to using hand gloves and other protective gears to prevent themselves from the virus. In Many homes, people are now using water mixed with chlorine to wash their hands as a means of protecting their families from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, government institutions in the country have put into place protective measures to prevent further spread of the Ebola virus and the Liberian Government has also instituted several measures including the closure of its borders with neighboring countries to curtail the death tolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently, no one is willing to go to hospitals or clinics for treatment as they are afraid of getting in contact with the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the spread of the Ebola virus, President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf has already declared the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the country a national emergency calling on Liberians to do all to protect themselves against the Ebola epidemic. Government has also instituted measures to restrict those traveling in and out of the country as well as those living and traveling in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pres. Sirleaf has also constituted a National Task Force, headed by her to combat the Ebola outbreak. The role of the National Task Force is to work with the country's health team to provide support and guidance to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Red Cross says the current spread of the deadly Ebola virus is escalating and warned that efforts be multiplied to urgently contain it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary General of the Liberian Red Cross, Fayiah Tamba has said the latest confirmation from Bong and Bomi is an evident that the spread of the virus is now rapid and troubling.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tamba, however, warned the public to do away with the concept of denial and follow all precautionary measures including regular hand washing and avoiding close contact with sick persons suspected of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Red Cross will continue to scale up its vigorous operation in the seven counties including Bong and Bomi where Ebola cases have been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross is complementing government effort in the areas of social mobilization and awareness, contact tracing, psychosocial counseling and providing survivor kits to victims since the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross, in addition to its services, has agreed to assist the Ministry of Health in the area of dead body management and burial of Ebola victims in Montserrado for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Liberian Red Cross has welcomed the latest move by the Government to close all borders except the Roberts International Airport, James Spriggs Payne Airport, Foya Crossing, Bo Waterside Crossing and Ganta Crossing where preventive and testing centers will be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LNRCS Secretary General called on the Government and its partners to pay more attention to protecting health care workers who are the front liners in this fight against the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Tamba, if the health workers are protected, we will regain their confidence to return to the various health facilities that are currently abandoned across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of Ebola can occur through direct contact with the blood, secretion, or other body fluid of an infected person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is now the largest in history with more than one thousand cases and 660-deaths while more than 240 of the cases and 127-deaths occurred in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Relief group, Samaritan's Purse, has announced that a second American aid worker in Liberia has tested positive for Ebola. The latest development comes barely hours after another American, Kent Brantly had become infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Writebol, 48, is employed by Serving in Mission, or SIM, in Liberia and was helping the joint SIM/Samaritan's Purse team that is treating Ebola patients in Monrovia, the organization said in a press statement quoted by CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writebol, who serves as SIM's personnel coordinator, has been living in Monrovia with her husband, David, according to the organization's website. Reports say Nancy and her husband who are residents of Charlotte, North Carolina, have been in Liberia since August 2013, according to the blog Writebols2Liberia. They have two adult children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Samaritan's Purse announced that American doctor Kent Brantly had become infected. The 33-year-old former Indianapolis resident had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia and started feeling ill, spokeswoman Melissa Strickland said. Once he started noticing the symptoms last week, Brantly isolated himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly, the medical director for Samaritan Purse's Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia, has been in the country since October, Strickland said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Ebola outbreak hit, he took on responsibilities with our Ebola direct clinical treatment response, but he was serving in a missionary hospital in Liberia prior to his work with Ebola patients,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials in West Africa say the Ebola outbreak in the region is the deadliest ever. As of July 20, some 1,093 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are thought to have been infected by Ebola since its symptoms were first observed four months ago, according to the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testing confirmed the Ebola virus in 786 of those cases; 442 of those people died. Of the 1,093 confirmed, probable and suspected cases, 660 people have died. There also are fears the virus could spread to Africa's most populous country, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a Liberian man hospitalized with Ebola in Lagos died, Nigerian Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man arrived at Lagos airport on July 20 and was isolated in a local hospital after showing symptoms associated with the virus. He told officials he had no direct contact with anyone with the virus nor had he attended the burial of anyone who died of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirmation of the death in Lagos came after news that a doctor who has played a key role in fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone is infected with the disease, according to that country's Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan is being treated by the French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, agency spokesman Tim Shenk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before falling ill, Khan had been overseeing Ebola treatment and isolation units at Kenema Government Hospital, about 185 miles east of the capital, Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola typically kills 90% of those infected, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% because of early treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials believe the Ebola outbreak has taken such a strong hold in West Africa because of the proximity of the jungle -- where the virus originated -- to Conakry, Guinea, which has a population of 2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because symptoms don't immediately appear, the virus can easily spread as people travel around the region. Once infected with the virus, many people die in an average of 10 days as the blood fails to clot and hemorrhaging occurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease isn't contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms include fever, headache and fatigue. At that point, the Ebola virus is spread via bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers are at especially high risk, because they are in close contact with infected people and their bodily fluids. Adding to the danger, doctors may mistake the initial stages of an Ebola infection for another, milder illness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of the first victim of Ebola Virus Disease in Nigeria, who died in Lagos on Friday, has been cremated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, a Liberian citizen, Patrick Sawyer, was hospitalized with Ebola in Lagos, but died later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the cremation were not available at press time, but Nigeria's Vanguard Newspaper reported that the event was witnessed by officials of the Lagos State Ministry of Health and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, led by its Project Director, Professor Abdulsalam Nasidi, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to cremate the body of the victim, it was further gathered, may not be unconnected with the deadly nature of the Ebola Virus which is known to be easily transmissible from human to human during handling of corpses of victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization recommends that in communities where there is an outbreak of Ebola, appropriate containment measures including burial of the dead should be properly handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While stating that people who die from Ebola should be promptly and safely buried, WHO notes that cremation, which is the application of high temperature to reduce bodies to basic chemical components (ashes), is ideal for safe disposal of bodies of persons who die during outbreaks of highly infectious diseases such as Ebola Virus in order to minimize further transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the paper, In 2013, the Lagos State Government introduced its Voluntary Cremation Law under which a person may signify interest to be cremated at death or a deceased's family members who must attain the age of 18 years, can decide to have the corpse cremated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vanguard said that under the law the state government can also cremate unclaimed corpses in its mortuaries after a period of time and the ashes disposed after a 14-day notice with approval of the Commissioner for Health.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN OUTBREAK of Ebola could spread worldwide after an infected plane passenger introduced the deadly virus to Nigeria, health experts warned last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous outbreaks were confined to forests and rural areas, but this one has already spread across four countries in West Africa and has killed 672 - the disease's biggest death toll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news came as it emerged that an American doctor working for a charity in Liberia had become infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kent Brantly, 33, from Texas, had moved to the country for the Samaritan's Purse organisation with his children and wife, Amber, to help contain the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 others have been infected by the virus, which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims. The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an air traveller brought it to Nigeria, health experts now fear infected air passengers who do not realise they have the virus could spread it around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 170million people, Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and airlines fly from there to Britain, other European countries and North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20 after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his sister, who had also succumbed to the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country. Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said: If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be cause for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers - but doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symptoms include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN American doctor working in Liberia to save West Africans infected with the deadly Ebola virus has contracted the illness himself and has been quarantined in an isolation unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 660 people of the 1,100 who have fallen sick with Ebola have died, in the worst outbreak of the haemorrhagic fever on record - a death rate of more than 60 per cent. Some strains kill nine in 10 of those who become infected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kent Brantly, a former GP in Fort Worth, Texas, became the third senior doctor in less than a week to fall ill with the virus he was trying to treat in others. Dr Samuel Brisbane, from Liberia, died on Saturday at a clinic in the country's capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sierra Leone's leading Ebola specialist, Dr Sheikh Umar Khan, also tested positive last week, and is being treated at a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res clinic. He is expected to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Brantly had fallen ill with the virus on Saturday, according to a statement from Samaritan's Purse, the American Christian aid agency for which he worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is currently undergoing treatment at a Samaritan's Purse isolation centre,&quot; the organisation said. &quot;We are committed to doing everything we can for Dr Brantly at this time of crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 33-year-old doctor had left behind his comfortable life as a community GP in the US in October 2013 and moved to Liberia with his wife and two children to work for Samaritan's Purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His family was on holiday in the US when he fell sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola outbreak shows no signs of abating, with authorities across West Africa now on higher alert after a Liberian man carrying the illness flew unchecked from Monrovia to Lagos, Africa's most populous city, and died there. He was vomiting during the flight, raising concerns that other passengers could have contracted the illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any surge in infections in Lagos could be impossible to contain. Travellers leaving airports in the main affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - were having extra checks, but doctors have warned that symptoms can take time to show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations of the virus's victims in Sierra Leone are increasingly mistrustful of Western doctors' attempts to save their family members, and are resorting to traditional healers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that means that they are forcibly carrying their sick relations from isolation wards back to their villages, signifi-cantly raising chances of further contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More people have died now in Sierra Leone than in Guinea, where the outbreak of the virus was first identified in February. World health authorities have warned that infections could continue for months.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, a government official said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in an outbreak that the World Health Organisation says has killed 129 people in the west African nation. A Ugandan doctor working in the country died this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor fell ill with the disease and in Liberia, Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, announced at the weekend that an American doctor was battling Ebola. Dr Kent Brantly had been isolated at the group's Ebola treatment centre at the ELWA hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second US citizen, Nancy Writebol, who had been helping patients, has also tested positive in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman from Sierra Leone who refused traditional medical help has died of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, officials announced on Friday that a Liberian official had died of Ebola after flying from Monrovia to Lagos, raising fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa. The WHO says the outbreak, the largest recorded, has killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brisbane, who once served as a medical adviser to the former Liberian president Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F Kennedy Memorial Medical Centre in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After falling ill with Ebola, he was taken to a treatment centre on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf used her Independence Day address to discuss a new taskforce to combat Ebola. Information minister Lewis Brown said: &quot;It will go from community to community, from village to village, from town to town in order to increase awareness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever and sore throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts believe the west African outbreak could have begun in January in south-east Guinea, though the first cases were not confirmed until March. Officials have tried to contain the disease by isolating victims and educating populations on how to avoid transmission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Liberia's most high-profile doctors has died of Ebola, a government official said Sunday, highlighting the risks facing health workers trying to combat the deadly disease. Dr. Samuel Brisbane is the first Liberian doctor to die in the outbreak, the World Health Organization says has killed 129 people in the West African nation. A Ugandan doctor working in the country died earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO says the outbreak, the largest ever recorded, has also killed 319 people in Guinea and 224 in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brisbane, who once served as a medical adviser to former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Medical Center in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After falling ill with Ebola, he was taken to a treatment center on the outskirts of the capital, where he died, &quot;Mr. Tolbert Nyenswah, an assistant health minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information also reaching The INQUIRER has revealed that Mr. Patrick Sawyer, a WASH consultant at the Ministry of Finance, who had been quarantined since falling ill after arriving in the Nigerian State of Lagos for a conference last Sunday has died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our information, the news of Sawyer's death was relayed to Liberia by the Nigerian Embassy, early Friday morning. Nigerian government health authorities announced Thursday that Sawyer, 40 was being tested for the deadly Ebola virus in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, a megacity of 21 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer's death is the first recorded case of one of the world's deadliest diseases in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economic and most populous nation, with 170 million people and some of Africa's least adequate health infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed 632 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began in February, straining string of weak health systems despite international help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus which starts off with flu-like symptoms and often ends with horrific hemorrhaging has infected about 1,048 people and killed an estimated 632 since this winter, according to the numbers on July 17 from the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is both rare and very deadly. Since the first outbreak in 1976, Ebola viruses have infected thousands of people and killed about one-third of them. Symptoms can come on very quickly and kill fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in the wake of the Ebola outbreak in the country, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has declared the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the country a national emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf has accordingly called on all Liberians to come together to fight the disease regardless of political, social, economic and religious persuasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader said she was declaring the Ebola outbreak a national emergency because of its deadly effects, adding, &quot;We must show a deep sense of nationalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf made the declaration on Saturday in her message at programs marking the observance of Liberia's 167th Independence Anniversary held at the Centennial Memorial Pavilion in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader has accordingly constituted a National Task Force, headed by her to combat the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said the National Task Force will be co-chaired by the Internal Affairs Minister, Morris Dukuly, in his capacity as head of the National Disaster Relief Commission, which, according to her, will be reactivated after months of inactivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her capacity as head of the Task Force, President Sirleaf called on women organizations, the Inter-religious Council, market and Labor organizations, political party leaders, traditional leaders and the media advocacy group Press Union of Liberia (PUL) to designate representatives to serve on the taskforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the role of the National Task Force is to work with the country's health team to provide support and guidance to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to President Sirleaf, the Task Force will also establish community outreach force that will mobilize individuals from the communities to reach out to residents and sensitize them on the disease by providing them information as to how they can protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader urged Liberians to go across borders and join their brothers and sisters of neighboring countries affected by the virus; pointing out &quot;the hallmark and success of any nation is not in the social and economic infrastructures polices and laws, but it is the love we have for our country and others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, report says nurses at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center are refusing to continue work as death toll continues to climb from the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information reaching this paper says the Emergency section at JFK is being shutdown and a small team of health care workers and patients are being moved to another floor in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the ER will remain closed until it is sprayed thoroughly and quarantined for 21 incubation period. Nurses and doctors are being advised by family, friends and loved ones to stay away from the hospital until the Ebola subsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading doctors at both JFK and Phebe Hospital are currently quarantined at the ELWA Hospital in Paynesville where health practitioners from the Samaritan Purse have been working around the clock to treat serious cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nelson Korkor, the lead doctor at Phebe was brought down to Monrovia three days ago and is being quarantined along with the late Dr, Samuel Brisbane, a former Chief Medical Doctor at the Firestone Rubber Plantation Hospital and a Physician assistant who died from the virus on Saturday. The doctor from Phebe is said to be in critical condition. Report also said the PA's condition is deteriorating, a senior hospital administrator told said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIGERIA said yesterday that Ebola virus caused the death of a Liberian man in quarantine in Lagos, confirming that the worst-ever outbreak of the disease has reached Africa's most populated country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, said &quot;thorough medical tests&quot; had confirmed that Ebola virus had caused the man's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 40-year-old, who worked for the Liberian government, had flown to Nigeria via Togo's capital, Lom&eacute;, for a meeting organised by the west African bloc, ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), the minister said. He suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhoea after arriving at Lagos airport and was taken directly to hospital, the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He insisted that the patient &quot;avoided contact with the general public&quot; between the airport and the hospital. He said that &quot;all the passengers that the patient came in contact with have been traced and are being investigated&quot; in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus through the city of 20 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of July 20, the number of Ebola cases recorded during the epidemic stood at 1,093, including more than 660 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation. Liberia has seen a total of 127 fatalities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man has died of ebola in Lagos, the first confirmed case of the highly contagious and deadly virus in Africa's most populous metropolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Sawyer, a 40-year-old Liberian civil servant, collapsed on arrival in Nigeria's main airport on Sunday, health officials said. His condition rapidly deteriorated before he died, said Abdulsalami Nasidi, project director at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu yesterday confirmed that the man had tested positive for the ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death marks an alarming cross-border development in the ebola outbreak that has spiralled into the world's biggest epidemic, spread across three west African countries. At least 660 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since ebola was first diagnosed in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathogen is passed through contact with bodily fluids of infected patients, and has no known cure, although chances of survival improve dramatically with early detection and treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But weak health systems and frequent cross-border travel have hampered efforts to contain the virus in a region which has never before experienced an outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos state authorities said they had requested the flight's manifest to contact the other passengers. State health adviser Yewande Adeshina added that protective clothing had been given to health workers. Sawyer flew from Liberia's capital of Monrovia, with a brief flight stopover in nearby Togo. His sister is believed to have died of ebola in the last month, a Liberian official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumours about the virus - which causes a painful fever that degenerates into internal and external bleeding - were met with scepticism from residents in the crowded business district where Sawyer was treated. &quot;I cannot believe it is true,&quot; said trader Segun Kosoko, who said he had seen two traders donning face masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts have also been alarmed by the disease's wide geographical spread, from Guinea's remote interior forest region, where it originated, to densely populated coastal regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana has had several unconfirmed scares, while Sierra Leone's capital Freetown recorded its first confirmed case this week. Authorities launched a public appeal after the victim slipped out of hospital. Her family forcibly removed her - as many have done, either fearing they would catch the disease while in quarantine, or doubting its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio stations in Freetown, a city of about 1 million people, broadcast the appeal to locate the woman, named as Saudatu Koroma. &quot;She is a positive case and her being out there is a risk to all. We need the public to help us locate her,&quot; the appeal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koroma, 32, had been admitted to an isolation ward while blood samples were tested for the virus, said Sidi Yahya Tunis, a health ministry spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia this week, a man burned down a room in the ministry of health after his 14-year-old relative died of ebola. He said a lack of doctors and nurses - many of whom have been ostracised from their communities - had led to the boy's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's ministry of health urged residents to follow guidelines to prevent the virus's spread, and launched a hotline number.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But reacting to the claims Thursday at a press conference in Monrovia, Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah denied the allegation and described it as 'wicked'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister Nyenswah said the ministry, as a guarantor of people's lives, will never engage in such negative act, and that the ministry's job is to save living things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another area of concentration is the myth that the Ministry of Health is extracting parts from people and that we selling kidneys to international people, and we taking hearts to sell; we are not. Before Ebola, people were dying in hospitals,&quot; Nyenswah indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister further clarified that the Ministry of Health as guarantor for the lives of people cannot be the same institution killing people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing reporters, Minister Nyenswah said the ministry will at no time engage in such negative act and called on individuals in the myth to desist and believe the existence of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it is unfortunate and erroneous that ministry that is heavily involved in educating citizens to keep away from the dead bodies of Ebola positives can be the same institution extracting body parts for business purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah: &quot;This information is unthinkable, devilish and misgiving for somebody to perceive that the Ministry of Health is going around doing these wicked things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Monrovia yesterday arrested a man in Congo Town for setting the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare on fire, leading to the burning of one of the conference rooms of the Ministry's building.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although, circumstances leading to the man's action has not been fully established, but sources closed to the Ministry said that the action of the perpetrator was in connection with the death of his brother who he claimed the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare gave wrong impression that his brother died from the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Deputy Health Minister for Administration, Hon. Matthew T. K Flomo, the alleged perpetrator (name withheld) was arrested minutes after security officers assigned at the compound of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare alarmed about fire outbreak in the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some by-standers who were on the scene told the INQUIRER that the perpetrator visited the Ministry on Tuesday and yesterday, Wednesday before committing the arson act. According to them, during the program with the President at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare yesterday, the perpetrator even asked a question at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perpetrator was immediately arrested by PROSECON; a private Security Firm owned by former lawmaker, Saah Gborlie, along with the Liberia National Police and is currently in the custody of the Liberia National Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking later, the proprietor of the PROSECON Security Firm, Mr. Saah Gborlie, condemned the action of the perpetrator. According to him, the action of the man is tantamount to the act of terrorism which should not be taken for granted in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Margibi Senatorial hopeful Saah Gborlie in the pending 2014 Special Senatorial Elections said his men are professionally trained to combat any crime, and that what occurred at the offices of the Health Ministry should not be blamed solely on his men. According to him, all Liberians should look at the incident as a complete terroristic attack on the part of the Liberian people by a single individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the aborted arson scenery, the INQUIRER reporter saw several people running helter-skelter in the Ministry as they tried to surmise the cause of the fire in the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We noticed smoke in one of the conference rooms; it was fire and everybody got alerted and it was not too long when the entire conference room was gutted by fireand all of us, including Minister Walter Gwanigale ran out of the building for our dear lives,&quot; an employee stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Police will keep the suspect in its custody for 48 hours and after its preliminary investigation, turn him over to be prosecuted by the court for allegedly burning one of the conference rooms of the Health Ministry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry residents in ELWA, a suburb of Paynesville, yesterday barricaded one of the main entrances of the ELWA Hospital in the Community, protesting against the erection of EBOLA Center in the compound of the ELWA Hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents, mainly, women, men and youths were seen in their numbers with posters and placards at the entrance of the ELWA Hospital's first entrance protesting that the deadly disease, EBOLA should not be sheltered in the community. &quot;EBOLA is evil; it should not be built in this community,&quot; the residents chanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this Paper visited the scene of the protest action, it observed that the protesters were unhappy and frustrated over the Government of Liberia and its partners' desire to build an EBOLA Center in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of them believe that the action to have an EBOLA Center in Montserrado County was not bad, but another area should have been selected on the outskirt of Montserrado instead of their congested communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the arrival of District 6 Representative, Edwin M. Snowe, and as the crowd grew bigger they demanded the immediate intervention of Representative Snowe, while, some of them were seen in tears as they cried that the EBOLA situation may affect them one way or the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter who was on the scene vividly saw a group of protesters gathering in their numbers with some of them using profane languages against almost everybody, the Government of Liberia, Samaritan Purse, and even ELWA Hospital, as well as Rep. Snowe for allowing an Ebola Center to be erected in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Director of SIM at the Compound of the ELWA Hospital, Joseph F. Wankollie said it was the ELWA Hospital's own way of identifying with the ELWA Community and the Government of Liberia in contributing to curtail the deadly EBOLA outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the protest action by some residents, the SIM Deputy Director said it was not good for community members to embark on protest action, especially, what will benefit them. He said several communities in Montserrado County do not have centers for EBOLA patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the center when built, will host patients in Montserrado County and parts adjacent and boost the efforts of the Government to save of people infected with the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President and Chief Executive Officer of Morweh Energy Group in Liberia, Dr. Christopher Z. Neyor, has underscored the need for adequate support and attention to be given to health workers in Liberia in the midst of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, health workers must be provided the necessary safety gears by the Government of Liberia (GOL) and others to help combat the deadly Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is a deadly disease that has no cure or vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 60 persons including ten (10) nurses have died as a result of the Ebola virus since the outbreak in March, 2014 in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Neyor maintained that the primary objective of government is to protect and empower its people and therefore, health workers across the country must be properly protected to cater to patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former President/CEO of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL) was speaking on Saturday, July 19, 2014 when he served as guest speaker at a program marking the 34th Initiation of the First Year Medical Students of the A. M. Dogliotti College of Medicine in Congo Town, outside Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said government must prioritize the health of not only its citizens but those that are providing medical services to people who are ill and that more emphasis must be placed on the training and recruitment of specialists in different medical fields to help guarantee the survival of patients, noting that, &quot;prevention is less expensive than cure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Neyor noted that government must invest in finding solutions or preventing diseases that are dangerous to the livelihood of the citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said fear amongst the health workers combating the Ebola virus would be curtailed or minimized, if more protective gears are provided to them across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health workers are the first respondents during the outbreak of any disease; and you cannot send your soldiers to battle without empowering them. Any government which does not do that means it does not love its people. We should give health workers gears not only to help the patients but to also protect their lives. Health workers lost their lives; they are now afraid. And the way to avoid that is to ensure that the necessary protective gears are provided.The prime duty of any government is to protect and empower the citizens; and ensuring the health and well being of your people is an integrated part of this. The first duty of a statesman is the health of your people. Seeking the health and well being of your people do not only mean providing hospitals or clinics but also ensuring investment in preventing diseases. We should place emphasis on preventive medicines and ensure the health of our people by training health workers. We need to put emphasis on the development of specialists,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said health facilities constructed across the country must be occupied with trained health workers including doctors and nurses to help save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the necessary medicines and supplies are needed at these health facilities to ease some of the difficulties patients encounter while traveling abroad for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Morweh Energy boss has provided the amount of LD250,000 to help purchase preventive gears for health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neyor stated that the gesture would help bring courage to the health workers while executing their respective functions in the midst of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that the purchasing of the protective gears for the medical practitioners would be done by the Liberia National Red Cross Society (LNRCS) in collaboration with the Liberia Medical Students Association (LMSA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then called on the Liberian government to use funds allocated for the celebration of this year July 26 to the fight against Ebola in Liberia as the National Legislature has initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neyor also added his voice to that of Kofi Woods and others that instead of the pomp and pageantry for celebration of Independence, the necessary funding must be appropriated towards purchasing safety gears for those that risk their lives to cater to persons affected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the celebration of National Independence in Liberia at this time is uncalled for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Liberians to use the day to offer national prayers and fast to God to help redeem their country from the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely a week following request by the National Legislature for the declaration of a State of Emergency against the deadly Ebola virus, the lawmakers have gone further by crafting a resolution for money allotted for the celebration of Liberia's 167th Independence Anniversary to be used to fight the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the House of Representatives crafted a Resolution mandating the Executive to cancel the July 26 celebration and use funds allocated for such purpose by the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare to contain the rapid spread of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its regular session yesterday, the Liberian Senate concurred with the House's Resolution to use the money for the fight against Ebola with some amendments to the original version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its amendment, the Senate agreed that the money for the July 26 celebration be sent to the Health Ministry to combat the virus but dropped the version which states that the Independence celebration for the year be cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary of the Senate has been mandated to communicate with the lower House of the Senate's decision and inform the Executive about the decision taken by the national legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the Liberian Senate expressed serious concern over the rapid spread of Ebola and the death toll from the epidemic. The Senate last week mandated the Executive Branch of government to declare a State of Emergency against the Ebola virus outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Grand Kru County Senator, Dr. Peter Coleman, has disclosed that the Government of Liberia has made available US$100,000 from the July 26, 2014 Independence Day celebration to be used on the fight against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Coleman who chairs the Senate Committee on Gender, Health, Social Welfare and Women and Children Affairs on the Ebola Epidemic, said other partners are also contributing to the Ministry of Health to enable the Ministry contain the epidemic which has spread to at least seven of Liberia's fifteen counties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah, has disputed media reports that the nut, 'Garcinia Kola', commonly known as bitter kola, is a cure for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said to date no vaccine or cure has been found for Ebola. A local daily reported on Tuesday that the nut had stopped the Ebola virus in test tubes in initial laboratory experiments, experts, including a Nigerian pharmacologist, revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Liberia News Agency, Assistant Minister Nyenswah made the bitter kola-Ebola cure clarification at the regular Thursday Ministry of Information press briefing held at the Ministry in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Minister Nyenswah is calling on the public to report anyone or group of people administering vaccines supposedly for the prevention of Ebola or any form of drug or tablets, herbs or injections in the communities to the nearest police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Health Ministry is also calling on people not to listen to any information from unknown individuals or groups, except that provided by the Ministry of Health and partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Nyensuah, anyone caught administering fake vaccine or tablets and even spreading wrong information on the Ebola disease would face prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Ebola virus continues to claim the lives of Liberians, the Liberian Senate has stepped up efforts against the deadly Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Liberian Senate on Thursday launched a rally to raise little over US$6,000 to help purchase some materials intended to fight the virus. The Ebola epidemic has so far spread to at least seven of Liberia's fifteen counties with an increase in the death toll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the rally which was held in the Chamber of the Liberian Senate, Pro-tempore, Gbenzohngar Findley informed his colleagues that the virus has reached an alarming rate and as such efforts were needed to prevent the further spread of the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-tempore Findley said many of the hospitals and clinics lack the necessary equipment including common gloves to be used by health workers and nurses who are risking their lives to save others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while the Government was doing everything possible to raise money to fight the virus, lawmakers must make personal contributions by at least purchasing cartons of gloves and other materials to help the hospitals and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predicated upon this according to the Grand Bassa County lawmaker, it was necessary that members of that august body make personal contributions to assist in the purchase of gloves and other needed materials as health workers battle the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the session, many of the Senators raised serious concern over the alarming rate the virus has reached in Liberia and called for a state of emergency to be declared by the President against the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of them agreed with the Pro-tempore that they should assist with the fight against the virus by making little contributions on personal level apart from government's own contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to their words, the Senators raised over US$6,000 following their day's session as their personal contribution towards the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, some citizens have commended members of the Liberian Senate for their personal contributions towards the Ebola war. The citizens at the same time, called on other sectors of the Liberian Government to contribute personally with needed materials and equipment to strengthen the fight against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASSISTANT HEALTH MINISTER for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah, has disputed media reports that the nut, 'Garcinia Kola', commonly known as bitter kola, is a cure for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE SAID TO date no vaccine or cure has been found for Ebola.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCORDING TO MR. Nyenswuah, anyone caught administering fake vaccine or tablets and even spreading wrong information on the Ebola disease would face prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE OUTBREAK OF the deadly Ebola epidemic which has now spread to seven counties is something to be very worried about because it is claiming lives and rapidly spreading in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE MIDST of the outbreak, there are some unscrupulous individuals who are claiming that the 'Garcinia Kola' otherwise known as Bitter Kola is the cure for Ebola. Some of these individuals are also going around administering fake vaccine which they said could contain the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE CALL ON the public not to listen to any information from unknown individuals or groups that bitter kola or vaccine can cure the Ebola virus.Those are false information and only intended to give our people false hope. Only information provided by the Ministry of Health and partners should be embraced by the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE BEST THING to do in the midst of the rapid spread of the virus is to take preventive measures and not to give credence to the false information. Beware that there is no cure yet for Ebola and nothing else, but can be prevented if the proper instructions are followed to the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DO NOT ALLOW anyone claiming to have vaccine for Ebola to administer it to you, your children or family members because this is dangerous and only intended to worsen the situation. Let us prevent ourselves against this deadly virus in accordance with the Health Ministry's advice and not to follow information that are only intended to provide false hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, ACCORDING TO experts, no known cure has been discovered for Ebola except preventive measures therefore, let us not allow anyone to lie to us that there is a vaccine against it or bitter kola can cure it. Let us do the best thing by preventing ourselves and families against this deadly disease. YOUR LIFE IS IMPORTANT, SO DO NOT PUT IT ON THE LINE.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">390 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few days ago, the Superintendent of Grand Bassa County, Madam Etweda Cooper, constituted an Ebola Task Force to sensitize citizens of the county about Ebola disease and measures to prevent it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While launching the task force over the weekend in the port city of Buchanan, Superintendent Cooper said the Task Force will lead the fight against the deadly virus in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told a cross-section of Bassa citizens that indeed, Ebola exists in Liberia and that it kills in &quot;a very short period of time and has no cure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting statistics from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Grand Bassa Superintendent said 71% of those affected with the virus have died, including health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said, &quot;It is about time that citizens do all in their power to adhere to the rules of engagement about what causes Ebola and those foods and the hygienic components of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hail the Bassa Superintendent for such worthy initiative intended to sensitize the citizens of Grand Bassa and others residing in the county about the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Government and its partners are doing everything possible to combat the virus, we also call on local authorities to emulate the good example of Supt. Cooper by ensuring that their people are sensitized and be aware of those preventive measures to curtail further spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the Ebola virus has spread to seven of the 15 counties and has claimed lives of many citizens, that is why urgent measures must be taken by not only the government but also local authorities to help their people understand the danger associated with Ebola and how to prevent it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that the fight against the deadly Ebola epidemic cannot be left alone with central government but all Liberians including those residing in the various counties, districts, chiefdoms, clans and even the towns and villages. If we all get involved in the fight against Ebola, Liberia will win the war against this killer virus and end the death tolls in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why we are again lauding the efforts of Madam Cooper and her county team for initiating the process. In the same vein, we call on other county authorities to emulate this good example by setting up either task forces or organized groups to ensure that every citizen is knowledgeable about Ebola. Remember, prevention is better than cure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a meeting convened yesterday at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Sambo told Minister Gwenigale and his staffs that cross border transmission is of great concern to the WHO. He said they believe that it is possible to stop the disease and that is why he is visiting Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He congratulated Minister Gwenigale and his team and said there's more to be done. According to him the Ebola disease is emerging from various communities.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Liberia's Health Minister, Dr. Walter Gwenigale, has denied receiving any fund from President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria. He thanked Dr. Sambo for the support and said that the Ministry of Health needs additional support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the cross border issue, Dr. Gwenigale stressed that the problem with the border is that there are a lot of intermarriages going on. He mentioned that's how the Ebola disease came into Liberia and that the Ministry of Health is faced with a great challenge. He told Dr. Sambo that traditional practices are other ways the disease is being transmitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health boss said there are other counties that have not been affected by the Ebola virus and that they are doing all they can to prevent the outbreak of the deadly disease in those counties. He appealed to the WHO Regional Director for more support to strengthen their surveillance in those counties and at the borders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare recently announced that over 60 persons including ten health workers have died so far from the incurable Ebola Virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serving at guest speaker at the 34th Initiation of first year students of A. M. Dogliotti College of Medicine in Congo Town Saturday, Neyor said the donation of the LD$250,000 was intended to assist health workers carry out their functions against the spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Neyor disclosed that the Liberia National Red Cross Society (LNRCS) and the Liberia Medical Students Association (LMSA) would spearhead the purchase of the protective gears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports of the shortage of protective gears at various health centers across the country, thus resulting to health workers contracting Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Neyor said the fear amongst health workers over the spread of Ebola would be minimized if more protective gears are provided for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neyor wants government to prioritize the healthcare of nurses and other health workers who are providing medical services to the populace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added &quot;We should give health workers gears not only to help the patients but to also protect their lives. Health workers lost their lives; they are now afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Neyor, the prime duty of any government is to protect and empower its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that the first duty of a statesman is the health of your people, adding &quot;seeking the health and well being of your people do not only mean providing hospitals or clinics, but also ensuring investment in preventing diseases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on government to place more emphasis on training and recruitment of specialists in different medical fields to help guarantee the survival of patients, because according to him, &quot;prevention is less expensive than cure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He supported the Legislature's decision for fund allotted for the celebration of the country's Independence celebration to be re-directed toward the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1092 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now an accepted fact that the Ebola virus is in Liberia and is real. It has thus far claimed the lives of many Liberians. The disease which started from Lofa County has now spread to other areas. Even those who were skeptical and doubtful about the existence of this are now convinced that this deadly disease thus exists in this country, as the no longer harbor the notion that this was only for &quot;'money making&quot;, as there was nothing called EBOLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indisputably, while this deadly disease has been linked to the medical field, especially so as it relates to man's life, I have decided, considering its consequences to human life and survival, to deal with it in the context of being a threat to man's survival, which comes in many forms. And so today, I have decided to look at this issue as a menace and threat to man's survival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the flexibility of the English language, I see &quot;Ebola&quot; to mean anything that threatens the survival of man in his daily activities. Economically, I see Ebola as any activity or actions that threaten the growth and development of some activities of the country's economy. As it is known, the media, as a &quot;public institution,&quot; is also a business that operates and survives from the kind of business it does, mostly in line with its business operation. This comes in the form of doing business with the public and institutions, including the government of Liberia that does business with the media to get information to the public on some of its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media, as part of its income-generating activities, always do business with the government, as it serves as the conduit between the people and the government. As such, the government uses the media in its public affairs activities to get pertinent and important information to the public. Among such businesses are those of the bidding processes, publication of announcements, the publication of speeches and special features or supplements on some of the activities that some of the government's ministries and agencies undertake in line with their statutory mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, these publications are done and pre-financed by the media, especially the print media, with the hope that payment would be done promptly by the government institutions. Regrettably, this has not been the case, which has now ensued between the government and the media over the payment of funds owed the media for work done for the government. The media has now embarked on a campaign to have thousands of United States Dollars government ministries and agencies owe the media. Someone puts this figure at nearly half million United States Dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of government's indebtedness of the Liberian government to various media institutions is not a problem for now, as it has been in existence for years now. At one point, when the media mounted protest action and nonviolence approach to the issue, the government decided to make some settlements, with the view of making final payment later. Disappointingly, since what was referred to as &quot;GOLDEN HASNDSHAKES,&quot; during which time some payments were paid, nothing has been done to make settlements of the huge amounts the government ministries and agencies owe the struggling Liberian media. The government has not been able to live up to its promises, thus adding more to its indebtedness to the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes people argue that since the government is not meeting its part or side of the bargaining, the media should discontinue to do business with the government or to place an embargo on all works from the government. Every time the media threatens or attempts to take some actions, there would be some interventions or assurances. And so the media has been accommodating and tolerant, with the belief that things would improve for the better. As part of its engagement and interactive strategy, the media has thought otherwise to continue to do business with the status quo, hoping that one day the government would reserve this negative trend of delay in the payment of works done for its various ministries and agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all fairness, considering the volume of works being done by the media for the government, the continued delay on the part of the government's ministries and agencies to pay for work done by the media, can be likened to killing the media or something that poses a threat, like Ebola, to the survival of the media. This cancer by the government is killing the media, as it continues to affect the life and survival of the media. The same way the Ebola virus is deadly, the action of the various government's ministries and agencies is also deadly, as failure to pay also affects the operation of the medias as the media depends on such funds for its operation, an act, which could paralyze the media, knowing the huge amounts these institutions owe the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever the issue of press freedom is spoken of, it is not just the issue of people exercising their rights to speak out, but also the environment, such as the economy of the country. When one speaks of the media economics, consideration is given to its ability to generate income for its operation. This comes from the placement of advertisements or supplements, as well as special features by the government and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dichotomy of the media is that it is a &quot;PUBLIC INSTITUTE and &quot;BUSINESS.' As a business, it generates funds and is also expected to pay legitimate taxes to the government which can only be done if the government and other media do business with pay for those works or placements in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, for this government its agencies always request tax clearance whenever they want to make payment. When they make request to carry an advertisement, they do not request to see tax clearance, but whenever it comes to making payment, it is then they demand tax clearance. How does the government expect the media to pay its taxes, when, this very government is an EBOLA&quot; to the survival of the media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a 'Catch 22' situation, as the media continues to serve the government because the people must be informed of its activities; the government does not see the need to make payment. This is also bad public relations. The government cannot be talking about building Liberian capacity and at the same time engaging in acts detrimental to its survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Health Ministry wage war against the deadly disease EBOLA, the Information Ministry of Mr. Lewis Browne, a former student activist, must also wage war against this &quot;Economic EBOLA&quot; virus that is gradually killing the independent media.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Norwegian psychologist has been working for Medecins sans Frontieres in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, helping to fight the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, which has killed more than 600 people so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was expecting the Ebola epidemic to be gruesome and unlike anything I had seen before. But I really didn't expect its magnitude - this outbreak is enormous. In Sierra Leone, it killed off a lot of health workers before MSF even arrived. Not surprisingly, medical staff were reluctant to work with us at first. A large part of my work involves helping them with counselling and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hygienists have the hardest job of all because they are the ones dealing with the dead bodies. Since our Ebola centre opened two weeks ago, we've had 37 deaths: two or three a day. A lot of the cleaners are young, unskilled workers. In an area with an unemployment rate of 95%, they jumped at this opportunity to get a job.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are the ones who mop up the vomit, the stools and the blood. And when there's a death, they are the ones who retrieve the body from the isolation ward, put it in the morgue and disinfect it. In the final stages of the disease, the viral load increases massively, which means the dead bodies are extremely contagious and very dangerous to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealing with the dead bodies is disturbing: the hygienists experience feelings of sadness and fear, but also disgust. When Ebola patients die, there's bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. The cleaners tell me they have flashbacks of the things they have seen and of things they have smelled. Even wearing a mask, you can't shut them all out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, in Sierra Leone dead bodies are taken care of by the tribal elders. A lot of the hygienists feel they are too young to be dealing with the dead, so worry they're being disrespectful of their culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local staff experience huge stigma from the community. The son of one of our workers recently died from malaria. People in his village immediately said he had caused his son's death because he was working with Ebola. It was very distressing for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, three people who had been cured were discharged from the isolation ward, and all the cleaners were dancing, deliriously happy and taking photographs. They find ways to manage the stress: they take good care of each other; when someone is upset, they talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a girl came out of the isolation ward. Her name was Bintu and she was almost two. Both her parents had tested positive for Ebola, but she tested negative, so we had to take her out of the ward because the risk of contamination was too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the two days she'd been in the ward she'd been so shocked that she hadn't uttered a word. This can happen to children - it's called elective mutism. When she came out, she was in shock: she didn't make eye contact; she didn't speak to anyone. We put her in a chair and she turned around, with her back to the world. It must have been a terribly disturbing experience for a child: to see someone come into the ward in a spacesuit, to hear them speaking to her mother in words she didn't understand, to see her mother start crying, and then to be handed over to the stranger in the spacesuit and carried off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sat with her for four hours, trying to talk to her in a calm and normal voice and singing her songs, to see if the shock would pass. By the end of the four hours she had turned around and was facing me. She made eye contact, she put her hand out for me to touch her, she tried to start a conversation with me. You could see that she wasn't in the same condition. But Bintu became an orphan that day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Red Cross Society (LNRCS) has clarified speculations of Ebola vaccine in some quarters that Red Cross staffs are in various communities vaccinating people including those suspected or confirmed with the deadly virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LNRCS's Secretary General, Fayiah Tamba, made this statement yesterday at a press conference in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tamba said the act of people wanting to use the identity of the institution to carry out their clandestine deed is evil, unacceptable and wants the Police to arrest and prosecute anyone caught in the process professing to be a Red Cross staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there had been calls received from some friends and partners relating to the involvement of LNRCS providing vaccine for the deadly Ebola and that LNRCS has been a partner to the government especially in the fight of the deadly Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the LNRCS is not in the business of providing vaccine, and not even for Ebola because it has been made known by the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare (MOH&amp;SW), International Partners, and the LNRCS that the deadly Ebola disease does not have any vaccine, and not even a cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that there is no way an institution like the LNRCS that is behind the effort of MOH&amp;SW to come up with a vaccine and that the LNRCS is not in any community providing vaccine for the deadly Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamba said if anyone is caught in any community that will confess being a Red Cross employee and is providing vaccine should be arrested by the community and be turned over to the Liberia National Police (LNP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if anyone has said MOH&amp;SW has provided vaccine for Ebola is just an act of being evil, and people of such nature should be arrested and turned over to authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;While the Red Cross is strongly collaborating in the areas of social mobilization and awareness, psychosocial counseling, contact tracing, and the provision of survival kits to victims, the rumor of Ebola vaccination by the Red Cross is false and misleading,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several experts from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) based in Atlanta Georgia, United States of America, have arrived in the country to join others in Liberia to fight the Ebola scourge. Also in the country to help fight the deadly disease, is a team of doctors and other experts from Medicine San Frontier (MSF) and Doctors Without Border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the disclosure yesterday at the regular weekly Press Briefing of the Ministry of Information, Assistant Health Minister, Tolbert G. Nyenswah said the experts are here to help in the fight against Ebola which has now become a serious problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said the epidemic is so serious that the MSF is now collaborating with government and its partners to build a large center where Ebola patients can be treated closed to the ELWA Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah told journalists that the Ebola disease is now confirmed to be in seven of Liberia's fifteen counties and named them as Montserrado, Margibi, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, Bong, Lofa and Nimba Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah also disclosed that the Regional Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) for Africa is also due in Liberia to extend more support to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also told journalists that it has been confirmed that health workers have been rejecting patients who go to the various hospitals but a meeting was called following which they were advised not to reject patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister Nyeswah said the Ebola epidemic is rapidly spreading and called on Liberians to take the disease seriously and take sick relatives to health centers where if confirmed with the disease, they can be isolated for prompt treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the News Conference, a representative of MSF urged Liberians to take the issue of Ebola seriously as the disease is spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF Official who claimed to have had fifteen years experience of fighting Ebola said the Ebola disease has not been so serious in places she had worked as it is in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She disclosed that MSF is supporting Foyah, Voinjama and will soon erect a bigger treatment site at the ELWA to fight the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and partners in a release issued and read by Minister Nyeswah at the News Conference said there is neither VACCINE nor CURE for Ebola. The release noted that 'Bitter Kola' as reported is not a CURE for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry is therefore requesting the public to report anyone or group of people seen administering VACCINE supposedly for the prevention of Ebola or any form of drugs (tablets, herbs or injection) in the communities to the nearest police station or immediately call Lonestar 1333 and Cellcom 4455.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health is also requesting the public not to listen to any other information from unknown individuals or groups except that which is provided by the Ministry of Health and partners. The Ministry said anyone caught will be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry is also calling on the public to take all necessary preventive measures, including: Avoiding touching dead bodies, body fluids, materials of infected Ebola persons; avoid direct physical contact, such as handshakes, kissing and direct contact with body fluids of infected or dead persons or animals and constantly wash hands with soap and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, four additional counties have been re-categorized as response counties bringing the total number of counties affected by the Ebola virus in Liberia to Seven (7). They include: Montserrado, Margibi, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, Bong, Lofa and Nimba Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry further said to date, 179 cases have been reported with 67 confirmed cases while at least 105 deaths have been recorded with 48 confirmed deaths since the second wave of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Liberia from May 29 to July 16, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, as the deadly Ebola virus continues to spread in the country, the Liberian Senate has expressed grave concern over the death toll of the epidemic and has therefore mandated the Executive Branch of government to declare a State of Emergency against the Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus which has so far extended to seven of Liberia's 15 counties according to a well-prepared report from the Senate Committee on Gender, Health, Social Welfare and Women and Children Affairs on the Ebola Epidemic, has claimed the lives of at least 173 since March to July 15, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report from the committee generated emotional deliberation amongst lawmakers some of whom argued that their counties were not benefiting from funds being released to combat the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee said since March to July 15, the death toll has hit 173 with Lofa reporting the highest of 110 deaths. Following the reading of the report, Grand Bassa County Senator, and President Pro-tempore of the Senate, Gbenzohngar Findley said he has met the leadership of the House of Representatives to mandate President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to declare a state of emergency against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers including Sen. Fredrick Cherue of River Gee, Thomas Gupee of Nimba and Sen. Oscar Cooper of Margibi County said the Ebola epidemic is rapidly spreading and claiming the lives of the citizens and as such money must be provided to enable health workers battle the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola has spread to seven counties and the death toll is increasing; let the government do all now to prevent further spread of this virus. Let us as Senators get involved in the social mobilization and press on the Executive to make available the US$1.5 million requested by the Health Ministry to contain the Ebola,&quot; Pro-tempore Findley told his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sen. Cherue, money is urgently needed for logistics as some hospitals and clinics in the country are now refusing patients. &quot;Let us take this matter as urgent as we can because nurses at the various clinics and hospitals are not protected and we have the responsibility to save lives so, let's act now with urgency,&quot; Cherue stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nimba County Senator, Thomas Gupee wants health authorities identify specialized hospitals and clinics with trained personnel to respond to the issue of Ebola with care and professionalism. He called on those carrying fake vaccines around to give the people hope to immediately desist from doing so or face prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sen. Cooper, nothing is more precious or valuable than human lives and therefore the US$1.5 million requested for, must be made available immediately to save lives and contain the further spread of the virus. He also called on the Senate to act now saying that the Government is responsible to act in times of emergency. &quot;We must craft a resolution and order the Executive to get the requested US$1.5 million because in just few days 111 persons have died from Ebola so the state of emergency is necessary to mobilize resources to fight against the deadly virus,&quot; Sen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare says there is no cure or vaccination for the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah said the Ministry is deeply troubled by news of group of people in the various communities administering Ebola prevention vaccine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Ministry of Information regular press briefing Thursday, the Assistant Health Minister said it was unfortunate that while the government and partners seek measures to contain the spread of the deadly virus in the country, individuals are bent on confusing the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been speculated in Monrovia and its environs that certain group of individuals was visiting various communities to administer vaccination for prevention against the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also speculated that bitter kola could prevent the virus. But, the Health Ministry has termed the speculation as untrue and has threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone found in such act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah has also asked community members to report any individual caught administering vaccine or traditional treatment for Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Assistant Health Minister, the public is encouraged to continuously take the necessary preventive measures, including avoiding direct contact with dead bodies, and body fluids of infected Ebola patients</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has announced that four additional counties have been re-categorized as response counties, thereby bringing the total affected counties to seven (7) in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah named Montserrado, Margibi, Bomi, Cape Mount, Bong, Lofa and Nimba as the Ebola affected counties in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that about 179 cases have been reported with 67 of those cases confirmed to be Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister also stated that the suspected ebola death rate has reached 105 with 48 confirmed since the second wave of the virus was reported in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regard recent speculations, The Liberia National Red Cross Society (LNRCS) says it is not giving Ebola vaccine as it has been speculated by the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary General of the Liberia Red Cross, Fayiah Tamba, said it is astonishing to hear that LNRC was involved in giving vaccine to members of the public against the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the deadly Ebola virus does not have a vaccine or even a cure; therefore, such speculation is untrue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Liberia National Red Cross is not in the business of providing vaccine. Fundamentally, we all have heard from the Ministry of Health and International partners that the deadly Ebola virus does not have a cure; neither vaccine. And there is no way that any institution will by-pass the government and administer vaccine, Mr. Tamba disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Thursday during a press conference held at the headquarters of the Liberia National Red Cross on Lynch Street, Monrovia, LRNC Secretary General explained that its involvement in the Ebola fight is to help deploy health workers in communities who are providing psychosocial education to those effected by Ebola disease and track down affected persons in communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said those who are spreading misinformation are doing so to tarnish the good working image of the LNRC, especially in helping the Liberian government to ensure that the deadly Ebola disease is curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anybody is in the community providing Ebola vaccine under the name of the Red Cross should immediately desist,&quot; Tamba warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He vowed that anyone caught in the act will be apprehended and turned over to authority of the Liberia National Police for investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Red Cross is one of the leading organizations involved in providing assistance to the Liberian people, especially through re-integration of war-affected youth and vocational skills training.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities at the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Medical Center in Sinkor have confirmed the closure of the hospital's emergency ward to the public following reports that the Ebola virus had spread.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports say nurses have been re-assigned on the regular ward. The hospital's emergency ward was shutdown following the death of a suspected Ebola patient (name withheld), who had been brought from the borough of New Kru Town last Thursday at the JFK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deceased, according to reports, showed all of the Ebola-related symptoms, including red eyes, vomiting, and/or high fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the patient's death triggered fear amongst nurses and other hospital staff, prompting them to put down their working tools in protest, thus leaving patients unattended to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, nurses initially fled the scene due to insufficient supply of protective gear which had left them vulnerable to contracting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, however, the JFK Administration, through its communications department, said that contrary to the report, the maternity nurses were not on protest, &quot;but rather taking precautionary measures after an alleged Ebola case was reported in the emergency section of the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normal working activities are currently in place, with surgeries and deliveries going on, the Management said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital explained that a patient came on Thursday from New Kru Town through the emergency section, and according to a medical practitioner assigned at that ward, the patient showed signs of the Ebola virus, and later died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With fear of passing on the virus, four nurses who are assigned in the emergency section immediately contacted the administration, which subsequently passed on the information to the Ebola response team at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOH/SW). Said response team responded in time to the situation,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to Friday and throughout the weekend, JFK said, the MOH/SW was in the process of taking specimens of the expired patient for laboratory analysis to confirm whether or not the patient died of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management, however, emphasized that the Maternity Unit is up and running, and there was no need to panic as the situation was under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, as the emergency room remains closed, the JFK Administration has noted the concerns of the nurses assigned there, and says it is doing all it can to ensure that the dead patient is removed for burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, members of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia (NAHWAL) over the weekend held a Memorial Service in loving memory of their colleagues who lost their lives in recent months to Ebola, while serving humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two nurses died in April this year from the Foyah-Boma Hospital in Lofa County, while others died at various locations in and around Monrovia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the deadly Ebola pestilence crossed over from neighbouring Guinea last February preying on its first few Liberian victims, many had thought it was a storm passing over. Five months counting, it seems that is not so, and that Ebola is seemingly here to stay. At the forefront of the fight to repel the pandemic is the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare along with its international partners fighting tooth and nail. While many are running scare, a few Liberian groups are coming forth to add impetus to the campaign; amongst them is &quot;Feed the Future&quot; which has announced its intent to fight alongside the Ministry. The Analyst's Sallu K. Swaray reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not too many Liberians and Liberian groups have mustered the courage to stand the face of Ebola, the virus that is arrogantly claiming many lives in the country and other West Africa nations. But &quot;Feed the Future&quot;, a Liberian NGO, is braving the storm. The organization's Chief Executive Officer, John T. Richardson, says the group is working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to eradicate the deadly Ebola Virus from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Richardson Tuesday told lawmakers recently that Ebola is now a national emergency that can never be understated in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that many are dying all over the place in the country in isolation, further stating, &quot;We have a local NGO working very closely with the Ministry of Health to bring about awareness with a compassionate phase for the victims and the families of Ebola of the deadly disease.&quot;Mr. Richardson said his organization's strategy includes incentivizing victims and their families to remove the stigma, and the fear that most people associated with this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are doing now with every individual that is isolated is that we are providing free cell phones with airtime to allow them to stay in touch with their families,&quot; Richardson said, adding that his organization has found out that when an individual has to go into isolation, he or she normally has to burn all of their cloths, mattress, bed sheets and all other things, which he said his entity is providing.Mr. Richardson divulged that another problem with the isolation of victims is that the families of the victims need to be educated to allow their infested family members under observation for 21 days and that during that period, they must be discouraged from leaving their homes, discouraged from going to the market and going to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Feed the Future is providing food, oil, soup kinds Maggi cube to victims or their families.Mr. Richardson stressed that it is important to tackle the Ebola pandemic from all aspects as it has posed serious danger to the lives of every Liberian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there is a need to embark a massive awareness across the country. Mr. Richardson said this require a lot of publicity; it requires logistics. He implored the Legislature to see reason and provide substantive support to the Ministry of Health and other groups involved with the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia Medicine and Health Regulatory Authority (LMHRA) has joined in the fight to relieve the country of the Ebola virus by taking the ongoing awareness campaign to pharmacists and dispensers across the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a discussion with some members of the media yesterday, the Executive Director of the LMHRA, David Sumo, said reports have reached the Authority that most people who fear going to the hospital because they will be quarantined for suspected minor symptoms are using the pharmacies and drug stores as their alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sumo said the Ebola virus is a current national medical emergency which is everybody's business therefore the Authority can not sit back and allow the means of transmitting the virus spread to another sector when it is within their purview to regulate those alternatives, noting that customers will have to interact with the dispensers during transaction and they too must be protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the dispensers need to be educated on taking keen note of the normal precautionary measures already provided by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and try not to manage cases beyond their expertise, adding that dispensers and pharmacists should always have room for referral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LMHRA boss reiterated that the Authority's strategy is to sustain the ongoing awareness at the various pharmacies especially in communities where there is reported outbreak of the virus so as to help raid Ebola out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the LMHRA has announced that it has placed Liberia first at the Inter Laboratory Testing (ILT) Center by being rated the best performing country this year after submitting the best result from the sampling of drugs gathered in its quality laboratory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sumo said Liberia has been participating in the international process for two years now and the sample of drugs this year was among 17 countries with an instruction to send findings from each country's laboratory facility to the Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled that last year, with Liberia being new in the process, it emerged with the highest score along with Ethiopia. However, he said there are still major challenges despite the strides made by the LMHRA both nationally and internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sumo explained that the Authority has been blessed with qualified individuals whose services are exceptional but the budget to commensurate with the labor is too low to even maintain the technicians and strengthen the human resource capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He therefore called on the government to consider a review of the LMHRA's annual budget and alleviated the Authority from its financial constraints as it pledges to do its best to keep Liberians as well as other residents safe and healthy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairman, Case Management Committee, Dr. Moses Massaquoi said Ebola exist and people do survive from it. He told reporters that if a patient is brought to the testing center for testing and that person case is confirm, he/she can survive the Ebola virus if the virus is at am early stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of Claudius Banarwolo was seen praying and crying when their brother walked out of the testing center yesterday. Many who where standing by commented that they now believed that the Ebola virus is in Liberia and it is real.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast has reportedly blocked 400 refugees who fled to Liberia from returning home because of fears they could spread the Ebola virus, a UN official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN refugee agency official Mohamed Toure said the decision violated domestic and international law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC quoted Mr. Toure as saying that Ivory Coast had acted &quot;unacceptably&quot; by turning away a convoy of refugees at the border with Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast said it could not allow the refugees in because of the Ebola &quot;pandemic&quot; in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has now killed over 600 people in the three states, with 68 deaths reported in the last week, WHO said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the worst outbreak the world has ever seen. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which spreads through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It kills up to 90% of those infected but if patients receive early treatment, they have a better chance of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest outbreak was first reported in Guinea in February, before spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN refuges agency had offered to carry out medical screening of the refugees, but Ivorian officials still refused, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group had fled to Liberia during the 2010-2011 conflict that hit Ivory Coast after then-President Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept defeat in elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivorian government spokesman Bruno Kone defended the decision to block the refugees from entering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone needs to show some understanding,&quot; he is quoted by AFP news agency as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We face the greatest pandemic our region has seen for a long time. We cannot be lax in this area,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) said 85 new cases had been recorded in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between 8 July and 12 July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone recorded the highest number of deaths - 52. Liberia reported 13 deaths and Guinea three, WHO said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures include confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO spokesman Dan Epstein said it would probably take several months to &quot;get a grip&quot; on the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are isolated, they're afraid, they're scared,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic Archbishop Lewis Ziegler has made a passionate plea to the public, especially the religious community, to see the Ebola outbreak as a national emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Christians should not doubt the reality of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia but should work closely with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and partners in containing the spread of the virus which has claimed lives and continues to affect the health of Liberians and other citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during a one-day Ebola sensitization workshop held at the Health Ministry in Congo Town at the weekend, Archbishop Ziegler urged the public to stop the state of denial, and limit contacts with bodies of people infected, dead or suspected of dying of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also appealed to the public against performing the usual religious, traditional and other burial rites for those dying or suspected of dying of Ebola because these practices expose the public to the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of the workshop, 67 religious leaders adopted a four-count action plan for the implementation at their various churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The religious leaders agreed to provide Ebola education at their various churches, Sunday schools, homes and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also agreed to provide hand washing buckets at their churches to prevent the virus, and also, work with the Ministry of Health and partners in reporting suspected cases within their communities and churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop was part of the Health Ministry's effort aimed at creating awareness and sensitization on spread of the deadly Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, the Liberian Council of Churches called for a national fast and prayer as part of efforts to contain the virus. As of July 10, two new suspected cases were reported, bringing the cumulative cases (confirmed probable and suspected) to 137, including 64 confirmed cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four new deaths were reported, bringing the total deaths to 85, including 40 confirmed cases. Liberia's Ebola case fatality rate is 71.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This indicates that the situation is still volatile and requires community, religious and traditional leaders' support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola spared through physical contact with a victim of the disease. The virus also spreads through sweat, saliva, blood, touching the vomit or urine of somebody who is sick with Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Representatives has forwarded to the Liberian Senate a proposal to use funds earmarked for the July 26 independence celebrations to fight the deadly Ebola disease in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Representatives suggested that after the Liberian Senate shall have endorsed the proposal, all funds intended for the Independence Day celebrations will be transferred to the Ministry of Health to create the necessary environment to halt the spread of the killer virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Liberia News Agency, the recommendation was contained in a report submitted by District 6 Representative, Edwin Snowe on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowe stated that the Ebola situation &quot;is very alarming and worrisome,&quot; so the July 26 funds should also be used to purchase equipment, equip health workers and initiate programs to educate the general public on the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hon. Ladies and Gentlemen, in addition to making the transfer, I ask your indulgence to substitute festivities of the day with prayers and fasting for the nation, asking God to deliver our land from the Ebola disease,&quot; Snowe said in the communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Representative said the National Legislature recognizes the Executive Branch's efforts by mobilizing regional and international aid in respect of taking actions that would contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the Liberian Senate Committee Chairman on Health, Dr. Peter Coleman is calling on the churches and the media to play a critical role in the sensitization of citizens on the risk associated with Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY SARAH OLIVER AND STEPHEN ADAMS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of emergency workers, faceless in their biological protective suits, works at the epicentre of an apocalyptic death zone. Amid scenes chillingly reminiscent of the Hollywood movie Outbreak, they are doing battle against the deadliest disease the world has ever known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola starts with symptoms of a common cold. It ends with excruciating death - massive organ failure and bleeding from every orifice - and kills up to nine out of ten of its victims. And crucially, it incubates for up to three weeks: enough for a carrier to unwittingly travel far from its cradle in central Africa to infect new populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, affected areas have been so remote, the risk of it travelling to Europe has been implausible. Suddenly, a new, vast epidemic in Sierra Leone and its bordering states has made that risk grave indeed. It is the first major epidemic outside central Africa and is already twice the size of the next largest recorded outbreak, which ripped through Uganda in 2000 and 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the UK, sea and air ports have been put on alert. GPs have been warned to look out for symptoms in patients returning from the danger zone. Questions have been raised over the health risk posed by the Sierra Leone team attending the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, which open in just ten days' time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those struggling to contain this deadly outbreak is one rather surprising figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beneath a plastic protective hood and full body suit, goggles, wellingtons, two pairs of gloves and a breathing mask is Cokie van der Velde, a 54-year-old Yorkshire woman who has left her family and beloved allotment behind to save lives in a frontline Ebola unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sanitation expert with the charity M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), Cokie is a veteran of 12 years' service with the charity. But she says nothing could have prepared her for what she has witnessed in Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This outbreak is totally, scarily out of control. Right now we are only firefighting,' the British aid worker says. The situation is deteriorating and there is much resistance from the population who are hiding the sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have the awful feeling that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg and it's going to get exponentially worse in the coming month.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grim but essential part of her job is to bury the dead safely. Tradition dictates the dead are washed by family in preparation for burial - tragically leading to others catching the killer virus. Cokie has had to persuade locals to sacrifice the rites of the dead for the sake of the living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says: Dead children have been the toughest part of the job. A dead adult is one thing but a child is another. I don't let my emotions get the better of me and I try to make the end the best I can. I give families plastic flowers to bury with their loved ones, or a little toy for a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's their final moments together, you have to acknowledge that, no matter what else is going on around you.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her all-consuming mission comes with 16-hour days and an all-too-often hostile reception from the very people she is trying to help. When we get a call we have to go out into the field to collect the patients. It can be tough to persuade them to come in because of course they see sick people entering the unit and not coming out. This just adds to the myth of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally there have been rumours that it's a cover for us to kill people and harvest their organs and that's why families are not allowed to look inside the body bags of victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's illogical but fear and suspicion do terrible things to communities. Think about it. Someone gets ill. We turn up in our plastic protection suits looking like we've just arrived from outer space and the sick person disappears for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our vehicles have been stoned and I've just been refused entry to a house which I was supposed to disinfect. There's a lot of room for misunderstanding when you cannot save a life or even hand back a body to be washed and dressed for burial as ancient tradition dictates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sometimes ask myself, &quot;What would happen if Ebola broke out in Europe?&quot; And you know what? I think it would be the same. The fear of it is primal.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is horrific lethality about Ebola that puts in a sinister league of its own. Named after the remote African river region where it was first identified in 1976, at first it can appear to be nothing more than a mild fever, with muscle pain, a headache and a sore throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then victims become weaker. They develop vomiting and diarrhoea. Days later as their bodies - now besieged by the virus - desperately attempt to fight back, their liver and kidneys start to fail. They become delirious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then Ebola begins to destroy them from the inside, causing devastating internal bleeding. In the most extreme cases victims vomit blood and bleed from the body's soft mucous membranes: the eyelids, nose and gums, genitals and anus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intestines haemorrhage uncontrollably. At last, the victim falls into a coma, and dies within hours of multiple organ failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is a clever killer, too. With an incubation period of between two and 21 days, carriers can come into contact with many people without knowing they have it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once they start showing symptoms - even just a sore throat - they can transmit it to others through any of their bodily fluids: urine, tears, sweat or blood. A hug, a peck on the cheek, a handshake: all can be fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still no vaccine and no known cure. Corpses are particularly high-risk, meaning the dead are as contagious as the living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest outbreak, 888 people have been infected and 539 people are known to have died across Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa. Experts believe these figures may be gross underestimates, with widespread reports of people trying to hide loved ones - alive and dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the midst of this maelstrom, Cokie is already on her second mission against Ebola this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She first left Whixley, West Yorkshire, in April to go into the death zone', returning home in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she had just six weeks respite before MSF asked her to head back to the isolation unit in Gueckedou, Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit's in three parts,' she explains. There's a neutral zone where you change into scrubs, a low-risk area where there's no eating, drinking or smoking and where you have to be in boots and scrubs, and then the totally protected area which you can only enter fully suited up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting into the suits takes ten minutes and the help of another person. There's your scrubs, then a plastic boiler suit with non-breathable zips, a plastic hood which hides everything except your eyes, large goggles over them, two pairs of gloves in case one pair is breached and a breathing mask which does not transmit particles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes you look like an extra from Contagion or Outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that goes a plastic pinny and then there's your wellies. After half an hour in the heat of Guinea I can pour the sweat out of my boots when I take them off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's all crucial. Ebola is so virulent it can be passed in blood, sweat, tears or even by the fluid which coats your eyeballs.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the smallest rip in Cokie's protective suit could let in the virus but she is coolly aware of the danger. It's critical that not a millimetre of skin is showing, especially on your face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People always ask if I am scared confronting a virus as deadly as Ebola but I'm the one in charge of infection control so if I'm not confident that's really bad news for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to have faith in your systems such as never, ever, touching your colleagues - there's no hugging or handshakes for the entire time we are out here. I don't think about catching it, that's the best policy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beneath the suit, divorcee Cokie - it's a childhood nickname coined by her sister, a shortening of her Christian names Agnes Caroline - holds on to the home comforts which help her endure life in this most extreme and terrifying environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has with her Marks and Spencer knickers, an electric toothbrush which she can charge from her computer and Jo Malone mandarin, lime and basil moisturiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She keeps up her spirits by listening to Radio 4's The Archers and The News Quiz, and by keeping in touch with her grandchildren Isaac, eight, Joseph, five, and one-year-old Suzannah, who are in Harrogate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these moments are just a brief respite from a burden which now casts a shadow beyond Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only border controls and First World medicine that make an outbreak of the tropical disease unlikely in the UK. And while the threat of Ebola might seem remote from British shores, the authorities here are taking no chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mariano Lugli, deputy director of operations at MSF, said this year's outbreak - the first major epidemic outside central Africa - was unprecedented'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, we have only faced relatively localised outbreaks in central African populations that do not move around that much,' he said. West Africa is very different, because the people move around so much. The geographical spread is so huge. It's unprecedented.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is commonly thought Ebola is transmitted to humans by contact with primates like chimpanzees and gorillas, scientists believe they - like us - are accidental' hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruit bats are the natural hosts. But the virus can break out into other animals, including primates, antelopes and pigs, when they eat fruit discarded by the bats. In some West African cultures the fruit bat itself is eaten as a delicacy. In others it is the handling or cooking of bigger bushmeat which poses the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way the disease can explode into the human population and in remote areas, where there is limited access to medical expertise and poor understanding of how it is spread, Ebola can quickly run rife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the West it is hoped any outbreak could be swiftly controlled by isolation and sterilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because it is not easily airborne like, for example, the flu virus, it cannot spread without human to human contact, so public health officials believe the risk to the UK remains minimal. The terrifying scenario is that it mutates so it can spread through the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, infected six piglets with Ebola and put them in pens where macaque monkeys - close relatives of humans - were housed in wire cages. Within eight days all four monkeys caught the virus through indirect contact. Droplets of moisture containing the virus were being exhaled with the piglets' breath. The research proved that in laboratory conditions at least, Ebola can spread in the same way as flu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now that is not an issue for Cokie and her team in Gueckedou. She is focusing on isolation and prevention techniques, while doctors and nurses help Ebola patients stay as strong as possible by feeding them and giving antibiotics to fight their other infections, painkillers and fluids The teams are bringing mortality rates down from nine out of ten to six out of ten. And that, by the deadly standards of Ebola, counts as a huge success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between her missions to the Ebola zone she spent time in Yorkshire tending to the strawberries and peas in her allotment. Now she thinks longingly of her family back home but feels she cannot return while there is life-saving work to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I miss my three grandchildren a great deal. But I do believe in the principle of humanitarian aid and that when poor nations need health care the rich should rise to the challenge. When the call comes, I go.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights lawyer, Samuel Kofi Woods, has noticed that over the past few months, government has been slipping into the state of extreme paranoia, with its reaction to issues and questions raised about governance that has not been addressed within the framework of willingness to dialogue but rather with acrimony and utter arrogance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this observation, Atty. Woods believes that it is dangerous for any government to thread on this path. He noted that every kind word is seen with an evil intent, every good deed is rewarded with evil and rebuff, sincere effort is met with anger, vindictiveness and disdain while proposals are accepted or rejected with cynicism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We find a way forward and entertain alternative views on our national progress and development. No view no matter how ignorant must be discouraged. It is within the cross-fertilization of ideas that our nation will prosper,&quot; Woods asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being aware of rebuff and renewed prot&eacute;g&eacute;' propaganda that is expected from the usual quarters, the Human Rights lawyer spoke tough that he would like to offer his views on several national questions re-emphasizing some with utmost urgency while insisting on what should be done to reverse this unfortunate course the country is now set upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a group of journalists yesterday at his law firm office in Monrovia, Atty. Woods narrated that there has been indications of increasing anger and anxiety on the governance of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, Liberians are beginning to lose faith in national leaders to proactively address the teetering problems facing the country. This situation needs to be addressed irrespective of political, social and economic persuasions and later recommended the need for a national consultative process to manage and address what is becoming a national discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods named the prevailing economic conditions exhibited by increasing poverty, high costs of living, increase in the rate of exchange affecting disposable income and savings, lack of a clear economic plan of action and a deep sense economic injustice are among the national discontent taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods, who served as former Labor and Public Works Minister during the first and second regime of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, has also recommended that as part of the national discontent, there is a need that concessions agreements negotiated by this government be revisited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Minister Woods argued that since the commencement of oil exploration in the country, there have been continuous argument in various quarters not only regarding the commercial viability of the samples that have been found so far but also the management of resources that have been accrued as a result of the sale of oil blocks with almost little or no consideration for local content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated that the rising insecurity, vandalism and threat to life which seems to be on the rise have the propensity to drag the country back into another conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, also a former Director of the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission (JPC) asserted that the recent Nimba incident is an indicator of the national discontent associated with the various concessions ranging from Nimba, Bassa, Sinoe to Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reechoed his position that this year's Independence celebration should be celebrated as national fast and prayer day which would afford Liberians the opportunity to pray for the country regarding the deadly Ebola epidemic and the lack of trust in public officials to deal with it. &quot;This year's budget must be used to support victims of the increasing flood and victims of Ebola,&quot; Atty. Woods indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however used the occasion for a sober reflection on the country's national situation thereby calling for a national consultative process to be structured and organized by the leadership of the religious community to manage and calm the anger, discontent and anxiety of the country's population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Boakai thanked WAHO and other members of the international donor community for their assistance so far to Liberia and then lifted praises to Nigerian President Jonathan for what he described as a truly brotherly donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Ghanaian President Mahama has called on other member states of ECOWAS to join the fight against Ebola by following the footsteps of Nigeria by contributing to the ECOWAS Fund to Combat Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town which caters to hundreds of people has been allegedly abandoned by hospital employees for fear of contacting the deadly Ebola disease, which recently killed a nurse at the hospital. The General Administrator of the Redemption Hospital, Mr. Dominic W. Rennie, disclosed that health workers, nurses and doctors are committed to serving patients at all times in the hospital but more patients are refusing to go to the hospital and get medical treatment because of Ebola outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with this paper yesterday, Mr.Rennie explained that last month one of the nurses died as a result of the deadly disease Ebola, predicated upon that some people blamed the Management of the Redemption Hospital being responsible for the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;M y brother you will not believe it; some people came at the Redemption Hospital and took away their patients, &quot;Mr.Rennie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rennie told this paper that since the Ebola issue started, only few patients can go to the hospital for medical treatment while the majority of the patients refuse to go to the hospital for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rennie added that despite the fear of Ebola issue at the Hospital, the Management is also constructing a cholera unit center to help save thousands of lives in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Rennie averred that information circulating in the Liberian Media that the Redemption Hospital has closed down, and that the health workers, doctors, and nurses are not catering to patients, is false. He said the information is a strategy designed by some individuals just to tarnish the good image of the Institution. He stated that the administration of the Redemption Hospital will continue to demonstrate its commitment and provide medical care to patients and make sure that patients' lives are saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr.Rennie narrated that health workers, nurses and doctors are always at work at Redemption Hospital catering and saving patients' lives on a daily basis without any nonchalant attitude exhibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rennie is urging people who are sick not to abandon hospitals and clinics because healthcare is a necessity and should not be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the president of the National Physician Assistants Association of Liberia, Mr. Jerry Kollie, yesterday said on a local station that his members are prepared and willing to work, but that there is a need for protection. &quot;Our members are willing to work, but they must be protected,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Association's leader called for collective effort to curtail the spread of the disease. He said contributions should not only come from the government but from other sources to combat the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REPORTS GATHERED IN Monrovia say the Redemption Hospital located in New Kru Town which caters to hundreds of people is practically abandoned by hospital employees for fear of contracting the deadly Ebola disease, which is alleged to have killed a nurse at the hospital recently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT THE HOSPITAL'S general administrator told this paper yesterday that the information being spread through the media that the hospital is closed is false and that the health workers, doctors, and nurses are still committed to serving patients at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DR. DOMINIC RENNIE however disclosed that more patients are refusing to go to the hospital and seek medical treatment because of the news about the Ebola outbreak; admitting that last month one of the nurses fell prey to the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALREADY, ACCORDING TO him, some people who blame the management of the hospital took away their patients and that it is only few patients who are seeking medical attention from the hospital while the majority of the patients have refused to go for medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEANWHILE, THE PRESIDENT of the National Physician Assistant Association of Liberia, Jerry Kollie, said in a local radio program that members of the Association are prepared and willing to work, but that their fear too is the lack of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE IT IS true that people are not taking advantage of the medical centers to seek medical attention despite the ongoing awareness it is also noticed that health workers are refusing to attend to patients who are suspected of carrying the Ebola virus and our concern is drawn also to the wellbeing of the essential health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE ARE ALL aware that the Ebola disease has no boundary like the HIV and AIDS and that the Ebola has no hands-on medication therefore in order to encounter and contain a patient who is down with such disease, the health workers must be sure that they too will not die saving lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORE PEOPLE ARE said to have died from this disease already and many more people are being quarantined due to the 21-day observation period even if the sickness is not Ebola but carries symptoms of Ebola; this is troubling and that is why the awareness must be broadened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE URGE THOSE in authority to widen the awareness campaign through any and every means thought of because this disease is seriously affecting families and to date, statistics show that it is affecting mostly breadwinners of families thus wiping out a generation of that family line because when a nurse or doctor who has gone to work dies from saving a live, that entire family's livelihood sets in limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE STRESSING THE need for greater awareness, we wish to commend all those including the Government and People of the United States and the latest contribution from the Federal Republic of Nigeria for continuing to identify with this country in its fight against the Ebola disease. At the same time, we urge those receiving these donated items and funds to ensure proper accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGAIN, WE CALL on the government through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and its partners to amplify the awareness campaign and distribute protective gadgets provided by international partners evenly as well as discover best strategies that would strengthen the ongoing awareness campaign thereby making it a reality to the Liberian custom.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare through the Senate's Standing Committee Chairman on Health has announced an urgent need for government to provide US$1.5 million to fight Ebola related cases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Ebola first hit Liberia few months ago, the Health Ministry requested US$1.2M to curtail the epidemic but due to budget shortfall faced by government, only US$250,000 was made available out of that proposed amount. There has been no breakdown of that money as to how it was expended, according to Sinoe County Senator Joseph N. Nagbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the disclosure yesterday at Capitol Hill during the Senate 45th day sitting in its chambers, Grand Kru County Senator, Dr. Peter S. Coleman, told Plenary that it is essential that funds should be allotted in order to equip the Health Ministry to combat the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Coleman, who won on the ticket of the opposition Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) in his presentation to his colleagues in chambers, disclosed that there are 138 cases of Ebola in the country currently with 43 deaths recorded. Out of these 43 deaths, 10 health workers have also died in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Kru Senator noted that the practice of traditional culture has posed danger to the fight against Ebola while the cases continue to increase. He told other Senators that 433 persons are under surveillance in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coleman, also a health practitioner announced that the health sector has been encountering challenges since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola epidemic and so it is noteworthy that the ministry be given all the financial support to tackle the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Health Minister during the tyrannical regime of convicted former President Charles Taylor informed his colleagues that due to wide publicity given the virus through the government backed by the local media here, Liberians currently traveling out of the country are facing serious challenges of being accepted by visiting countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Coleman said a comprehensive breakdown of the amount has been prepared, handed over to the Finance Ministry for perusal while the Health Ministry awaits mandate from the Senate's Plenary for budgetary appropriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that if the government finds it difficult in raising the amount, it should begin the process with little available amount to empower health workers and create some preventive measures that could safeguard Liberians in the near future if there may be any outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Sen. Coleman's report, Maryland County Senator, H. Dan Morais appealed to his colleagues not to underestimate the virus outbreak in the country and suggested that a state of emergency should be declared as a result of this deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After series of comments from several Senators supporting the request of the Health Ministry, Lofa County Senator, George Tamba Tengbeh, proffered a motion that the Plenary should mandate its leadership to meet with the House of Representatives' leadership in the soonest possible time and instruct the Executive to disburse the money.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Victor H Sumah lives in the Slipway Community in Monrovia where he manages his tailor shop. He walked into the offices of The Analyst yesterday to announce his claims that he's able to cure patients suffering from the deadly Ebola Virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have dreamed five times of how to cure Ebola having heard of it and seen it on my Facebook page. After that I went home to pray,&quot; Sumah said. &quot;In my dream, I saw that I contracted Ebola and I screamed, questioning God why he allowed such a sickness to get on me after I have given Him my body and soul as a living sacrifice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, eventually, God showed him the herbs which he pounded and robbed on his skin and the disease disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I woke up, I told one of my neighbors that I know how to cure Ebola but she just laughed at me. However, each time I go to bed, this same dream came to me and each time I tell people they will just laughed,&quot; Sumah further narrated. &quot;This is why I decided to get to the media to tell people that I am able to cure Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if doctors can avail to him patients confirmed as Ebola carriers, he will provide the cure and the patients will be healed in no time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can cure Ebola because whenever a sickness troubles me or anyone and I pray to God for the cure, and that cure is shown me in my sleep, I always free the victims from the disease,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cured my son who used to always jerk in his sleeps and get sick. I was tired with it so I got on my needs and prayed and God showed me the same medicine and it work. So, I am sure if I try it on an Ebola patient, it will work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sumah said if he provides the Ebola herbs and the patient drinks it three times and robs it three times, the patient and the world will see that he's telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me be bold that I really don't trust the Ministry of Health,&quot; he said. &quot;I only want to help people because they are dying from Ebola. I want the government turn my cure into medicine and help people when they get to know about me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lamented: &quot;It hurts me when people die from Ebola. I have decided to just say it since I have not yet had opportunity to meet an Ebola patient face to face. I am tailor by profession. I do my tailoring at the front of the United Methodist University (UMU). I need to try one person for the world to see the power of my Ebola medicine. From there, I will be healing Ebola patients. The person that showed me the Ebola medicine told me to fast and pray for one month before I can cure people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Coordinator for the Human Rights Protection Forum of Liberia, Ms.Korpo S. Kortimaihas observed many suspected ebola patients are dying in the hospitals owing to lack of care for them a situation for which she noted many others that could be infected with EVD are not forthcoming for treatments in the medical facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kortimai said the manner in which health authorities were responding to the Ebola situation was scaringly characterized by violations of the rights of the patients leading to deaths that may be blamed on the Ebola Virus Disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spoke in an interview with The ANALYST. The interview followed a statement Ms.Kortimai posted on a Journalist's page on Facebook page.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy coordinator of the umbrella group of more 40 rights group in Liberia has called on the government to investigate the human rights violation factor associated with the fight against Ebola and bring it to a halt, saying that many people could survive the deadly Ebola virus if they were given proper attention at the hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she was were taken aback as a right activist that people isolated based on Ebola suspicion were deprived food, medication and company, a situation which she noted was not only traumatizing but was equally violating their rights to food, medication and association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kortimai told this paper that the forum have heard from nurses interviewed at various hospitals in confidence that suspected Ebola patients who are isolated in confinement for 21 days were not being treated by medical practitioners due to the refusal by medical authorities to give them Ebola treatment regalia needed to securely attend to the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was not possible for any one placed in confinement while suffering running stomach and vomiting at the same time to live without food, treatment and company for almost a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights activist and women rights leader indicated that people kept in isolation from their families for the length of time covering almost a month while sick without food and medicine and without talking to anyone will sure die of trauma of hopelessness, which death - she said, should not be blamed on the Ebola Virus Disease itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter one's health situation or condition, s/he is entitled to the rights to security, the right to food; the right to medication - which are all fundamental in to life and safeguards to the existence of individual persons people,&quot; she told The ANALYST.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She therefor said violation of these rights while sick in isolation is traumatizing. &quot;This trauma, in addition to the sickness will cause suspected Ebola patients to die fast,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described the situation faced by Ebola Suspect in the medical facilities in Liberia as &quot;deadly violation of the suspected Ebola patients,&quot; asking, &quot;Do you expect a suspected Ebola patient, said to be passing wastes, to live without food, medicine, and even company that could give that person hope and a sense of belonging?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Kortimai pointed to some of the cases that she said might have caused death blamed on ebola, considering that not anyone suspected of ebola should die at all cost. She noted that such was the situation of baby mother who died in Redemption Hospital of alleged Ebola. &quot;I went around talking with people said to be family members and passers-by, and everybody crying, 'they killed the woman because they woman wanted food and they did not give her food'&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also recalled that the husband of the woman was heard on radio as saying that his wife did not die from Ebola. The man said his woman either died from hunger or they killed her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, this man said he was doing well and the child, all of whom interacted with the lady two days before she was confines in isolation, were all doing well since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether true or false - it is not deniable that Ebola may be around, but what we are saying is that people isolated on the basis of suspected ebola should be accorded their rights to food, medication and company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She indicated that if their families could not reach them because of fear, let the nurses be given the proper outfit that will disabused their minds and fears so that they will attend to the patients,Ms.Kortimai added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited a second case where a medical doctor, whose name she withheld for the main time, apparently died of starvation of recent. The Human rights activist disclosed that the doctor's wife is presently kept in confinement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the death of the medical doctor, Ms. Kortimai hinted that he used to call the wife on phone and complained of how he was hungry in confinement; although he was treating himself with medicine threw to his room of confinement by his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts by the doctor's wife to take food to her husband was said to have always been denied, wondering, &quot;How sure are we that the wife will not be violated to death in like manner?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was bad and it is a violation of the right of the woman to associate with her husband. She could be dressed in long trousers stocked in socks and shoes with long sleeves blouse with gloves and nose and mouth protectors to have a word with the husband,&quot; she maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted, &quot;For the purpose of Ebola fear, a spare Ebola regalia could be could reserved for spouses who would want to see the condition of their husbands or wives, fianc&eacute;s and fianc&eacute;es.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bible says a man will leave his parents and cleave to a woman and both shall become one, while marital vows exchanged provided both partners being together for better and for worse until death do them part,&quot; a reason she added that there was no reason to deprived wives from seeing their husbands and vise visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a secret that suspectedEbola patients are not getting proper treatment because of fear by nurses that they could be infected the ebola virus in the absence of Ebola regalia, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When one asks a health worker, why they cannot ask for the Ebola dress code, they usually express fear for dismissal. 'You want them to fire me? They may fire me, I am afraid', is always their answer&quot; Ms. Kortomai accentuated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Ms.Kortimahas commended the United States government for the donation of Ebola regalia to the Liberian government for the use of medical practitioners to fight against Ebola in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the donation was timely, but called ton the U. S. Embassy accredited near Monrovia to judiciously monitor the distribution and used of this anti-ebola donation so that it will not find its way into private clinics instead of hospitals to which Ebola suspects are taken, just as the mosquito nets and the cornmeal powder for malnourished people have made their way on to the market places and into the hands of peddlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She finally she said the Human Rights Protection Forum of Liberia is interested in ensuring that the fight against Ebola is sustained wholesomely and is therefore availing its services, provided the forum gets sponsorship, to monitor the fight against Ebola in the various hospitals and in communities around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This she added will reduce the risk and fear, and will ensure that Ebola suspected patients in most cases survive the disease, unlike presently when people suspected of Ebola are pronounced dead in the hospitals just hours or days upon their admission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From supercomputers to smartphones, technology could play greater role in combating spread of disease in west Africa</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Jeopardy-winning supercomputer is among technologies that could help prevent future Ebola epidemics such as the outbreak that has killed more than 460 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors have called for greater use of emerging technologies to curb the outbreak, and said many cases were going undetected as victims opted for self-help or traditional cures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Emerging technologies can help early-warning systems, outbreak response and communication between healthcare providers, wildlife and veterinary professionals,&quot; four doctors at the Mercy hospital research laboratory in the Sierra Leone city of Bo wrote in the Lancet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, headed by a US-based specialist, Karen Jacobsen, said smartphones should play a greater role in combating the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our laboratory and others in the region have shown that routine syndromic surveillance systems can be designed to rely on mobile phones which have become ubiquitous in west Africa,&quot; they wrote. Researchers forecast that mobile internet use in Africa will increase 20-fold in the next five years - double the rate of growth in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors - numbering as few as one per 10,000 patients in rural Guinea - have struggled to contain the spread of Ebola, which can have a fatality rate of up to 90%. Almost four decades after its discovery, the virus has no cure or vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year IBM announced a $100m project to use its Watson supercomputer to help solve African problems. Watson has been used to help treat cancer patients in the US and understands human language well enough that it was able to beat two champions on the US TV quiz show Jeopardy in 2011. Its ability to &quot;learn&quot; after rapidly analysing huge amounts of data sets it apart from conventional supercomputers that focus on number crunching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM's west Africa director, Taiwo Otiti, said: &quot;The beauty about Watson is it's a community computer. You could feed it information about Ebola cases, for instance, and then you could ask it questions, and it will give you a prognosis and suggest the best treatment for a particular patient based on that data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to the system could enable poorer parts of Africa to &quot;leapfrog&quot; stages of development in much the same way that mobile phones took off across the continent in places lacking landline infrastructure, Michel B&eacute;zy, a Rwanda-based technology professor who helped develop the Watson system, told the Guardian at the project's launch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other technology is being adopted to help curb diseases such as measles and malaria still epidemic in Africa. Researchers in Burkina Faso use satellite data to track Saharan dust storms and their connection with meningitis, an airborne disease transmitted more easily in dusty conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And simple text messages have played a vital role in health education. Fiona Mclysaght, Sierra Leone director of NGO Concern, said: &quot;It's a very useful medium to dispel myths and help change attitudes, and we've been using it a lot in urban areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 1,500 people have not yet been traced who are known to have come into contact with others confirmed or suspected to be infected with the haemorrhagic fever, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res (MSF) told The Daily Telegraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many more could be moving freely in the three countries battling the virus - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - but fear of the illness and mistrust of Western medicine means they refuse to come forward to speak to doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current outbreak is the worst in recorded history. So far, 467 people have died and health staff have identified at least 292 other suspected or confirmed cases. Ebola is transmitted by coming into contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. It has no cure and as many as 90 per cent of its victims die, often from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak was now &quot;out of control&quot; and could quickly spread across West Africa, according to MSF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spread of the virus appeared to have been halted in late April, by which time 74 people had died. Alpha Conde, Guinea's president, said the situation was &quot;well in hand&quot; and &quot;touch wood, there won't be any new cases&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a mix of mobile populations, mistrust of outsiders, traditional burial practices and lack of funding caused it to flare up again. The number of cases jumped by 129, or 38 per cent, in the week up to Wednesday, the World Health Organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health staff have even been attacked. The Red Cross in Guinea said it had been forced to suspend some operations in the south-east of the country after staff were threatened. &quot;Locals wielding knives surrounded a marked Red Cross vehicle,&quot; an official said. An MSF centre elsewhere in Guinea was attacked by youths saying the charity brought Ebola into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have covered six previous Ebola outbreaks and this is unprecedented,&quot; said Michel Van Herp, an epidemiologist with MSF in Belgium, who spent March and April in the region and is returning shortly. &quot;It is unique in terms of the number of cases, where they are and how they are spread, the difficulty of putting enough treatment centres where they are needed, and the fact that these people move about so much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> West African health ministers began a two-day emergency summit in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, on Wednesday to improve coordination of their responses to Ebola. Money was needed urgently for drugs, basic protective gear and staff pay, said Abubakarr Fofanah, Sierra Leone's deputy health minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bernice Dahn, Liberia's deputy health minister, said: &quot;In Liberia, our biggest challenge is denial, fear and panic. People are afraid but do not believe that the disease exists and, because of that, people get sick and the community members hide them and bury them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus remains contagious even if the person it infected dies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health authorities in Glasgow and organisers of the Commonwealth Games, which start in the city on July 23, said they were &quot;monitoring the situation on a daily basis&quot; because a team from Sierra Leone was competing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Curtailing Ebola Through Holistic Approaches [editorial]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">469 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEW DAYS AGO we carried an editorial, captioned: &quot;INTENSIFYING MEASURES AGAINST EBOLA&quot; in which we among other things called on the authorities to intensify efforts to create more awareness about the existence of the deadly disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE EDITORIAL AT the time came against the background from information by the Health Ministry that the epidemic is still active in the country and called on Liberians to take preventive measures in curtailing further spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THAT EDITORIAL published June 16, we began by thanking the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for the first step it took in creating a massive awareness from the initial stage when the case of the deadly Ebola was first reported in Liberia. We also urged it to continue its awareness throughout the length and breadth of this nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EQUALLY, WE CALLED on Liberians to believe that this disease exists and stop playing 'Doubting Thomases' and avoid being in this denial stage over the existence of this deadly disease. Liberians must abide by measures announced by the Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY, WE ARE constrained to reinforce this editorial because of disbeliefs by some Liberians about the existence of this deadly disease. Even with the news that it is gradually spreading, with reports of new cases, there are some skeptics and cynics who still feel that this is all about &quot;money eating&quot; scheme designed by some officials of government at the expense of the people, as they feel that Ebola does not exist in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR US, WE are convinced based on the information being given by the Ministry which has statutory mandate on health matters, that indeed, this deadly disease indeed exits in this country and that to doubt its existence is only suicidal. Latest figures show that there are 88 cases, with 49 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARTICULARLY, THERE IS a case in which the family of a lady who reportedly died of the disease is claiming that Ebola is not the case for their relative's death. Besides, there are instances of people because of their doubt, refusing to take victims to hospitals, rather, prefer to keep them home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHATEVER THE SITUATION, we call on the Ministry not to be deterred by these 'doubting Thomases' by continuing to carry out its awareness and preventive measures to avoid the spread of this deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH SUCH CONTINUOUS awareness, we feel that these 'doubting Thomases' would come to the reality of the existence of the disease, as curtailing this must be done holistically, with both the government and the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS WE EMPHATICALLY stated in our previous editorial on this matter, &quot;prevention is better than cure.&quot; Hence, Liberians must take this seriously and avoid denying its existence or making mockery of it when it continues to claim the lives of loved ones, relatives and friends. A hint to the wise is quite sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Government has donated another supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the World Health Organization to support the international response to the Ebola outbreak which is affecting Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation, including aprons, face masks, gowns, caps and cadaver bags, are in addition to a previous donation by the U.S. Government. Last week, the U.S. Government made a similar donation, including rubber boots, coveralls and gloves, which will protect health workers who are at the forefront of providing essential care to patients who are suspected or confirmed to have the Ebola virus. Health workers who use the protective equipment as recommended are protected from exposure to blood or body fluids from infected patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In presenting the items, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Liberia Mission Director, John Mark Winfield, said the U.S. Government is committed to helping in the fight against the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organization Representative to Liberia Dr. Nestor Ndayimirije, who received the donations, immediately passed the essential equipment to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare,and thanked the U.S. Government for the donations, which he said will help boost Liberia's response to the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Ndayimirije said partnership was important in the fight against the outbreak, and urged stakeholders to unite to improve the response by making sure no health worker is infected and dies because of the lack of protective gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In receiving the PPE, Liberia's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Bernice Dahn, warned that communities and religious institutions should not try to serve as health facilities.Shesaid Liberians are still in the denial stage, which is fuelling a deterioration of the situation. &quot;At this point, you do not know what you are dealing with,&quot; Dr. Dahn said. &quot;So, don't keep sick people in your homes or facilities. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, Liberia experienced a second wave of the outbreak. Since that time,more than 30 persons have died of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Government has provided additional support to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone to mitigate the Ebola outbreak, which includes supplying materials and messaging in communities to prevent the spread of Ebola, training environmental health technicians, financial support for deployment of field teams to the WHO Africa Regional Office and WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), training of health workers in contact tracing, and the provision of essential supplies for collection, preservation, transport and analysis of blood specimens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Ebola death toll rises in the West African region, Health ministers and officials from 11 West African countries are in the Ghanaian capital Accra for a two-day meeting on the Ebola epidemic which has killed scores of people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency conference was convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in response to the rapid spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa. It is the first time the virus has affected the West African region and it is also the worst outbreak since the virus first appeared in 1976 in what was then Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 760 Ebola cases were confirmed in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of June, according to the WHO. Nearly 470 people have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is a form of hemorrhagic fever that proves fatal in up to 90 percent of cases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with DW, Armand Sprecher of Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) explained where the disease originates. &quot;The virus is in constant circulation in bats. The assumption is that movements of the bat population transport the virus and then it moves into non-human primates like chimps or gorillas and then into humans, usually through consumption of bushmeat. The bats roost in trees that are likely also used by non-human primates for the purposes of fruit collection and the like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus is one of the world's most virulent diseases. Those at high risk of infection are health care workers, family members and others who come into close contact with sick and deceased patients. The Africa regional director of the WHO, Dr Luis Gomes Sambo, said the spread of the disease has been facilitated by the cross border movement of people in the affected region. Traditional cultural practices also play a role, he said. These include traditional African burial rituals in which mourners touch the corpse. This is problematic with deaths from Ebola because the disease can still be transmitted after death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sambo underlined the need for affected countries to better coordinate their efforts with the support of other countries in the region. He also called for more emphasis on research and relevant technology strategies as a way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope to discuss ways of preventing further epidemics and the need to undertake research to address the knowledge gap in relation to the natural history of the Ebola virus disease. We need also more research in relation to relevant technologies for treatment and more relevant preventive methods,&quot;he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's Health Minister Sherry Aryittey announced that the country's research institutes were available to assist in further research into the virus and the search for a vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nogushi memorial and research institute will be available to support research into how we can contain the outbreak and in future also find the needed vaccine to make sure that such an outbreak does not occur again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days earlier, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf announced that Liberians caught hiding suspected Ebola patients would be prosecuted. The Liberian deputy minister of health, Bernice Dahn, told DW that had been the right decision. &quot;I noticed that since the president's announcement, our coordination meetings have real impact, our political leaders are galvanizing their strengths, community members are calling more often, whenever they see something they are not satisfied with. I think it is helping,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dahn said the Accra meeting was very important in the fight to contain the outbreak. &quot;It is very important for us, so that we can come out with a common strategy to address the disease. The political will is there, we need the financial support, we have some partners but we need more,&quot; was her message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO Assistant Director-General Keija Fukuda said that although there is undoubtedly a need for financial support, African countries must assist each other with information sharing and better coordination if significant advances are to be made. Although there is still no vaccine and no cure for Ebola, Fukuda was optimistic that the battle can be won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are so many diseases that we have to deal with for which we don't have optimal tools. Nonetheless we have really learnt that these kinds of outbreaks, these diseases can be stopped. This is not a unique situation, we have faced it many times. And so I am quite confident that we can handle this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with DW's AfricaLink radio program, Tankred St&ouml;be, head of MSF Germany, said many people in the affected region were still not aware of the dangers of Ebola. &quot;There is a lot of advocacy work necessary to make people aware how they can avoid becoming infected and what to do if they see someone sick.&quot; A top priority should be the isolation of infected patients. However, a major obstacle is the fact that symptoms in the early stages are quite general - fever, headache, muscle pains - and not immediately recognizable as Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been dozens of outbreaks in the last 20 to 30 years, St&ouml;be said. &quot;Usually it stays regional [...] but the high mobility of people in these West African countries can be a reason for the current spread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging health authorities in West African countries affected by the largest Ebola outbreak in history to &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; in their efforts to contain the spread of the deadly virus, a United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) official underscored the critical need to engage community, religious and opinion leaders in the region to be at the forefront of the response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the opening session of the two-day Emergency Ministerial meeting in Accra, Ghana, Dr. Luis Gomes Sambo, WHO Regional Director for Africa, reiterated his call for urgent, cross-border, concrete actions to bring an end to the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, which he said is the largest reported outbreak in terms of number of cases, deaths and geographical spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 1July, a total of 750 cases and 455 deaths have been reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. &quot;The impact of this outbreak has been enormous in terms of loss of human lives and negative socio-economic effects,&quot; said Dr. Sambo, adding that health workers have been disproportionately affected, with over 60 cases and 32 deaths reported amongst this group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another disturbing marker for this West African outbreak, he warned, is that the Ebola virus is circulating in both urban and rural communities. &quot;The current trend of this epidemic and the potential of cross-border and international spread constitute a public health matter of grave concern,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging health ministers of the affected countries to &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; in their efforts to contain the outbreak, Dr. Sambo said: &quot;Your leadership is critical in ensuring that preventive and containment measures are effectively implemented in your countries. To this end, I would like to stress the need to redeploy human resources and reallocate funds to facilitate operations in affected communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO notes that cultural practices and traditional beliefs which are contrary to recommended public health preventive measures are contributing &quot;to a great extent&quot; to the continued spread of the virus in the three affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One example is traditional funerals involving ritual washing and close contact with the dead person. In addition, the extensive movement of people across borders has facilitated rapid spread of the virus across and within the three countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current Ebola outbreak has the potential to spread outside the affected countries and beyond the region if urgent and relevant containing measures are not put in place,&quot; said Dr. Sambo, calling for improved communication between the Governments, partners and communities to generate reliable evidence for implementation of effective and relevant actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the delegates, Dr. Sherry Aryeetey, the Minister of Health of Ghana said, &quot;We are here to make a real difference, a difference that will be felt beyond this room for millions of people in dire need for solutions. We have a small window of opportunity to prevent the outbreak of Ebola from spreading further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sambo said that the meeting is expected to agree on &quot;a single inter-country strategy, which will galvanize key actors, bring together expertise and mobilize resources for accelerated actions to combat the epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health ministers from 11 West African countries, high ranking health officials and international partners are attending the two-day meeting, which aims to agree on the best way to interrupt the transmission of the Ebola virus to reduce the socio-economic impact of the disease and prevent future outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus first struck human beings in 1976 in Yambuku, a village in the Democratic Republic of Congo, along the river Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, more than 20 Ebola outbreaks have occurred mainly in East and Central African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 2014, Guinea notified WHO about cases of Ebola, which were initially confined to rural Guinea with the epicentre being Gueckedou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What started as a rural outbreak has now spread to Conakry, the capital of Guinea, as well as across borders into Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When ebola first struck Pujeh, a village deep in Sierra Leone's forested interior, residents did what they always do when a mysterious illness brings death: they consulted the traditional healer. But the herbalist soon caught one of the world's most contagious diseases, and himself contributed to its spread as visitors streamed in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time officials had pinpointed Pujeh as a hotspot for the disease months later, dozens had died. &quot;The people living in these areas said there's no such thing as ebola,&quot; said a district doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have their traditional beliefs and their traditional cures and they look up to their traditional leaders. Until we can bring the traditional leaders onside, it will be very difficult to convince them that ebola even exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the death toll from the latest outbreak of the world's deadliest virus having climbed to 467 - far exceeding the previous most lethal outbreak, which killed 254 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - officials and health workers are battling a surge of infections propelled by misinformation and doubt about the disease's existence on one side, and mistrust of scandal-hit governments on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a World Health Organisation warning that the illness is &quot;out of control&quot; in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, west African health ministers yesterday began a two-day summit in Ghana's capital, Accra, to discuss ways to strengthen regional co-operation. The global health body has warned four other west African countries - Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau - to prepare for the possible arrival of travellers carrying the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some government officials have disputed the WHO's statement, saying the increasing death toll is a sign of better surveillance. &quot;We are not saying everything is okay but there are less people dying in silence now, which is a good thing,&quot; health ministry official Sakouba Keita said. &quot;The more we can identify when and where there are fatalities, the better we can prevent further cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tiny country has been hardest hit by the virus, which first appeared there in February before spreading through the tropical forests that sprawl into Liberia and Sierra Leone. More disturbingly, it has also jumped to all three countries' densely populated capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is different from other cases just by the fact it's a cross-border epidemic,&quot; said Dr Nestor Ndayimirije, Liberia's WHO representative. &quot;Previous outbreaks have been very localised, which makes them easier to isolate and contain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola was first identified in Zaire - now the Democratic Republic of the Congo - and Sudan in 1976. It was named after Congo's Ebola river, where its most lethal mutation - the Zaire strain - infected 318 people and killed 280.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Described by virologists as a &quot;molecular shark,&quot; ebola is believed to be hosted by the fruit bat, a delicacy in Guinea and Liberia. The current strain is at least the fifth mutation since its discovery in 1976. Diagnosis is often complicated by the fact that symptoms mirror those of malaria, including fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Victims sometimes have horrific internal and external bleeding and most die of shock or multiple organ failure, though the chances of survival increase dramatically if adequate treatment is received early on. No cure exists, but confirmed cases are quarantined before undergoing intensive rehydration therapy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weak public health systems have also undermined attempts to halt the disease. Sierra Leone and Liberia are both recovering from decades of civil wars, while half a century of dictatorship in Guinea ended in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily reports from Liberia's ministry of health provide a glimpse of how big the hurdles are. On the eve of the regional summit, two suspected cases from Voinjama travelled to the capital, Monrovia - but specimens were not collected because &quot;the county laboratory supervisor could not be found,&quot; internal notes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also warned of an acute shortage of thermometers for a team sent to trace people who may have been in contact with suspected victims. Many feared taking temperatures because of the risk of being exposed to the disease or attacked by locals, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alarmingly wide spread is partly down to an accident of human geography. &quot;The deaths have been increasing because of traditional burial rites in that region,&quot; said Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's deputy chief medical officer. The Kissi ethnic group, found in all three countries, traditionally keep their dead at home for several days, and mourners touch the deceased's head frequently before burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has a fatality rate of up to 90% and is transmitted through contact with fluids from infected people or animals such as urine, sweat, blood and saliva, even after death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, issued a warning on state radio that anyone suspected of keeping ebola patients in homes or churches would be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease has also revealed alarming mistrust between citizens and public office holders in a region with shocking corruption levels. It was initially viewed as a government conspiracy to depopulate Sierra Leone's Kailahun district, and fierce resistance to the arrival of health workers culminated in the stoning of a Medecins Sans Frontieres vehicle. In Liberia, many are adamant the outbreak is a hoax by government officials seeking to distract attention from recent scandals, or health officials raking in public funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers at the frontline of the battle - often the first to die - face other challenges. Last week, riots broke out and an ambulance was attacked as family members fought to reclaim a victim's corpse from a hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone's third largest city. On the same day, a three-man burial team were chased out of the Liberian town of Banjol, where they had gone to bury a victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials and several hundred researchers who have poured into the three countries have scrambled to disseminate public information, seen as key to containment. But when the outbreak began, text messages circulating in Guinea said an antidote could be found in a concoction of hot chocolate, coffee, milk, raw onions and sugar.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government only referral hospital in Kakata, Margibi County, C.H Rennie Hospital has denied the flee of nurses for fear of Ebola as reported by a local paper in Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was recently reported that nurses at the C.H Rennie Hospital were not reporting to work due to the fear of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But contrary to the report, the Medical Director at the C.H Rennie hospital, Dr Adolphus Yeiah who spoke to this paper has strongly rebuked the report, noting that though nurses fear the Ebola virus, but they are still carrying on their normal duties at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that due to the recent outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in that part of the country, patients at the hospital are leaving without doctor's advice, something he said is causing a serious problem at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Yeiah added that since the recent outbreak of Ebola, there has only been one affected patient who past off some few weeks ago, adding that nurses and doctors at the C.H Rennie Hospital are now fortified with lots of personal protective equipment to prevent them from contracting the virus and as such, they are effective in performing their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr Yeiah, the affected patient of the virus was a student at the Kakata Rural Teachers Training Institute (KRTTI) who was suspected of contracting from another family member who has also past off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said students who were seen with the affected Ebola patient are currently being contacted for observation for at least 21 days and further treatment in case they have been affected as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C.H Rennie Medical Director, Adolphus Yeiah however blamed the increase fear of Ebola by Liberians on what he termed as denial of the existence of the Virus in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then called on every Liberian to take all preventive measures in order to reduce Ebola victims in the country, adding that the Ebola virus is real and it is not mere speculations as people think.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) says the number of people killed by the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa has risen to 467.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO said sixty-eight of the deaths had been recorded since 23 June, prompting fear across the sub region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the WHO, the number of cases had risen from 635 on 23 June to 759, a 20% increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body said it is the largest outbreak - in terms of cases, deaths and geographical spread - to affect Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the WHO reported that most of the deaths have been centered in the southern Guekedou region of Guinea, where the outbreak was first reported in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO has called for &quot;drastic action&quot; to tackle the outbreak. &quot;Containment of this outbreak requires a strong response in the countries and especially along their shared border areas,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever, has no cure and is spread by contact with the fluids of infected people or animals, such as urine, sweat and blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of a renewed outbreak of the Ebola Virus in Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf has told Liberians that the disease has killed so many people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and still poses a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to President Sirleaf, to date in Liberia, 70 people have contracted this deadly disease while 46 of our compatriots have died, adding that these numbers will rise if Liberians do not listen to the advice from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and Partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call on all Liberians to now see the Ebola Epidemic as a national public health emergency. For those who do not believe that Ebola exists in Liberia, I want to inform all Liberians in this public manner that the disease is REAL and is in our country killing people. It is as I speak, taking the lives of our citizens in Lofa, Montserrado, and now Margibi County,&quot; President Sirleaf in a statement on state radio on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned that anyone caught hiding suspected Ebola patients will be prosecuted. Said some patients had been kept in homes and churches instead of receiving medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Government of Sierra Leone issued a similar warning last week, saying some patients had left hospital and gone into hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers fighting the outbreak say they have encountered resistance throughout the region, and that some of them have even been attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symptoms of the disease include high fever, bleeding and central nervous system damage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF) has reported the death of at least 90 persons from the deadly Ebola disease. UNICEF in its latest report puts the total confirmed death toll at 90.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UNICEF, as of 29 June, two new confirmed Ebola cases were reported. With these changes according to UNICEF, the total number of suspected, probable and confirmed cases reported for Outbreak #2 now stands at ninety (90).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said a total of forty-three confirmed cases, including twenty-six from Lofa County, one from Margibi County, and sixteen from Montserrado County are recorded, while a total of nine cases among healthcare workers are reported including five deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of Ebola-related deaths for Outbreak #2 in confirmed, probable, and suspected cases now stands at forty-nine with twenty-seven in Lofa County, two in Margibi County, and twenty in Montserrado County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF in its report further recorded twenty-six deaths among confirmed cases. The national case fatality rate (CFR) in confirmed and probable cases is reported as 59%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reported CFR for Montserrado and Margibi Counties according to UNICEF is higher at 66.7% than the 52.9% reported for Lofa County, with a total number of patients currently in isolation, twenty-five including nineteen in Lofa and in Montserrado.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In latest reports from the sub-committees speak of serious emphasis to improve contact tracing, designate a site for Ebola burials in Montserrado County, increase awareness, and ensure adherence to proper infection control measures in all health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through its Communications and Child Survival Sections, UNICEF continues to provide critical C4D, health and WASH sector support to the national Ebola response in coordination with National Task Force sub-committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health and WASH Units of the Child Survival Section provided 10 drums (45 kg each) of Chlorine; 100 cartons of soap; 500 digital thermometers; 100 insecticide treated nets, 50 pairs of rain suits, boots, gloves, nose masks, and rubber hats; and 30 pieces of overalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Communication Section said it continues to actively support the social mobilization sub-committee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite massive public awareness campaign by Governments and its partners cautioning citizens against the deadly Ebola epidemic which has already claimed untold lives in the country, many citizens have got their own perspective about the virus and how it can be healed. Native doctors, Pentecostal prayer warriors and other social skeptics have not been in tone with medical advice that Ebola is such an invincible and deadly disease as divulged, and therefore take their own subtle ways to deal with the situation, including holding patients at their own volition. But President Sirleaf has stepped in to overturn the nonconformists, avowing prosecution. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who think Ebola is a joke or that prayers can do where medical science fails need to think twice. The head of state Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has vowed to prosecute anyone found holding suspected Ebola patients in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a televised statement over the weekend, President Sirleaf accentuated warnings by medical officials that the deadly pandemic which has claimed several lives since February this year could further spread if citizens take warnings lightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been said that some individuals, principally prayer mothers and fathers, were taking patients into their compounds for treatment, professedly leaving many more vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said &quot;It is illegal under our public health law to expose the people to health hazard such as Ebola. Let this warning go out, anyone found or reported to be holding suspected Ebola cases in homes or prayer house will be prosecuted under the laws of Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said in the nationwide address that major issues confronting the response teams against Ebola include but not limited to keeping sick people in healing centers, prayer homes and other non medical centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These practices create public health hazards to families, neighbourhoods and other innocent people, she said, and threatened to prosecute anyone holding victims in their private homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President used her televised address to report that in awake of a renewed outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia, this has killed so many people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and still poses a threat including health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date in Liberia, she reported, 70 people have contracted this deadly disease while 46 of our compatriots have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These numbers will rise if we do not listen to the advice from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and Partners,&quot; he said and called on all Liberians to now see the Ebola Epidemic as a national public health emergency.</SPAN></P>

It is as I speak, taking the lives of our citizens in Lofa, Montserrado, and now Margibi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola spreads through physical contact with a victim of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus also spreads through: sweat, saliva, blood, by touching the vomit or urine of somebody who is sick with Ebola. These deaths are mostly due to denial, touching dead bodies or participating in Burial Ceremonies. Avoid touching dead bodies or body fluids or materials of infected Ebola persons. Avoid direct physical contact, such as handshakes, kissing and direct contact with body fluids of infected or dead persons or animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone has warned it is a serious crime to shelter patients infected with the Ebola virus who are in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health Ministry said several patients had discharged themselves from hospital in Kenema district, the heart of the country's outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for &quot;drastic action&quot; to contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has killed almost 400 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the largest outbreak in terms of cases, deaths and geographical spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been more than 600 cases in Guinea - where the outbreak started four months ago - and neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Around 60% of those infected with the virus have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO says that in Sierra Leone alone, there have been at least 46 fatalities out of a total 176 people infected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global health body has sent 150 experts to the region to help prevent the spread of the virus. However, it has warned of the potential for &quot;further international spread&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Shek Moar Khan, who is working with Ebola patients at Kenema government hospital, said his team met resistance when trying to inform people about the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers have been trying to explain to people in the areas affected that Ebola &quot;is not a mystery, but simply it is a disease that somebody can acquire, and if only they could listen appropriately to our advice, then we could break the chain of transmission&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the WHO told several West African countries - Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal and Guinea Bissau - to prepare for the possible arrival of travellers carrying the deadly virus.Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever, has no cure and is spread by contact with the fluids of infected people or animals, such as urine, sweat and blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the deaths have been centred in the southern Guekedou region of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has already warned that the Ebola outbreak is out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says the epidemic will spread further unless there is a stronger international response.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures come in the wake of reports that some health workers are NOT adhering to infection control measures in handling patients, especially those suspected of being infected with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the measures include the use of protective clothing when attending to patients suspected of Ebola or have signs and symptoms of the disease; identification of temporary isolation room for any patient suspected of the disease before referral can be made to the Ebola Isolation Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health facilities are also requested to carry out orientation for all staff on Ebola Prevention, and train clinical staff on the management of Ebola or suspected Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MOHSW is strongly requesting the public to ensure that deaths occurring at homes or in clinics without being certificated by a licensed medical doctor must be confirmed by the County Health Teams or the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare which will issue a death certificate and clearance before burial can take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health facilities are also requested NOT to refuse any patient, who presents Ebola-like signs and symptoms, but should properly assess and make referral appropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers are urged to carry out hygiene promotion infection control and sensitization in health facilities for all clinical and support staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of June 23, ten new cases and 3 new deaths were reported, bringing the total cumulative confirmed, suspected, and probable deaths to 28. Total confirmed cases stood at 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a hotline has been established at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare where the public can call to get Ebola-related information. The number is 0886229641.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fresh report has revealed a new center opened for Ebola patients at the ELWA Hospital in Paynesville outside Monrovia, with one patient in critical condition admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this paper visited the ELWA Hospital over the week, several persons were seen whispering and grumbling over the recent news of a center being erected in the hospital, something they referred to as worrisome and dangerous, especially, to a community that is very congested with an average of hundreds and more persons seeking medical attention at that hospital on a daily basis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some residents even feared that the situation may escalate looking at the content of the disease itself, being one of the deadly killer diseases just reaching Liberia and the limited medical equipments being provided to nurses and health workers as safe gears to use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the ladies who preferred anonymous told the INQUIRER that it was not bad to have an Ebola center at the hospital, but frowned on the location of the center that it was close to the laboratory of the ELWA Hospital and the Nurses Station of the same hospital, where several visitors and family members come in and out on a daily basis for various reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse, (name withheld) who led our reporter to the center that was erected, showed him tarpaulin structure built- walls, with several persons moving back and forth making the area very busy, and between the laboratory and the Nurses Station of the ELWA Hospital where the tent was then built, a white lady walked out of the tent, followed by another white man, all dressed in a usual hospital garment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, one person died from the same Ebola disease at the hospital, a case that was said to have been related to the lady that was reported at the Redemption Hospital. Meanwhile, President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf has called on Liberians in the country to see the deadly Ebola virus as one that is dangerous and should be taken as an emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader made the statement when she visited the Redemption Hospital in the Borough of New Kru Town where there was a renewed reported outbreak of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ebola epidemic in west Africa is &quot;out of control&quot; and will be contained only if politicians, religious leaders and aid agencies urgently improve their response to the unprecedented outbreak, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease, which is continuing to spread through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, has so far claimed 337 lives, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The total number of confirmed, probable or suspected cases stands at 528, with the disease identified in more than 60 locations across the three countries. The disease, which can kill up to 90% of those who become infected, was first reported in Guinea in March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Bart Janssens, MSF's director of operations, said the charity had already treated 470 patients and was struggling to cope. &quot;The epidemic is out of control,&quot; he said. &quot;We have reached our limits. Despite the human resources and equipment deployed by MSF in the three affected countries, we are no longer able to send teams to the new outbreak sites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF said that civil society and political and religious authorities were failing to recognise the scale of the epidemic, adding that prominent figures had to do more to promote the fight against the disease. Amid the panic, it said, key messages were not getting through and people were continuing to attend funerals where there were no infection-control measures in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janssens said ebola now had to be viewed as a public health issue throughout west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WHO, the affected countries and their neighbouring countries must deploy the resources necessary for an epidemic of this scale,&quot; he said. &quot;In particular, qualified medical staff need to be made available, training in how to treat ebola needs to be organised and, contact tracing and awareness-raising activities among the population need to be stepped up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the WHO said a failure to gauge the severity of the initial outbreak and a subsequent relaxation of counter-measures had helped give rise to a &quot;second wave&quot; of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the epidemic started, it was a little underestimated, so that the states took a while to really prepare themselves,&quot; said Pierre Formenty, a WHO specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of April, we started to see a decrease in the number of cases and we maybe saw a relaxation by the teams in the three countries, and this relaxation allowed things to restart. In addition, there were some problems with the affected populations which were sometimes not fully listened to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with AFP, Formenty said that the WHO, MSF and others had mobilised dozens of experts but doctors alone would not be able to contain the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important things are monitoring and communication,&quot; he said. &quot;States are getting better but the problems of communication continue. The medical corps on their own cannot stop this epidemic. It is only with the help of the population that we can fight this epidemic and stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formenty admitted that more needed to be done to explain the dangers of infection to those attending funerals or caring for the sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One case can restart an entire epidemic,&quot; he said. &quot;In an area where the quality of health services is not optimal, the populations have struggled to understand why we were asking them to make such an effort and probably we have not been able to explain both the disease and the means of control to the populations.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare has disclosed that the outbreak of the deadly Ebola epidemic is still active in the country and called on Liberians to take preventive measures in curtailing further spread of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the regular press briefing of the Ministry of Information in Monrovia yesterday, Assistant Minister for Preventive Services at the Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare, Tolbert Nyenswah, disclosed that two new cases of Ebola have been discovered in Foya, Lofa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nyenswah said after 42 days without confirmed new cases of the virus in Liberia, the second phase of the Ebola virus was reported in Lofa on May 30, 2014. Minister Nyenswah further disclosed that on June 9, 10 and 11; the virus claimed the lives of seven persons in Monrovia with four confirmed cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving an update on the Ebola virus in the three neighboring countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, Assistant Minister Nyenswah said presently there are 398 cases in Guinea with 254 deaths, while Sierra Leone has reported 97 cases with 49 deaths and 97 confirmed cases with Liberia recording 97 cases and 23 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said up to yesterday, two new cases have been discovered from Foya and the specimens have been sent to Guinea for testing. He said Liberia has recorded 26 cases of Ebola with 16 deaths and twelve confirmed cases with eight deaths of confirmed cases since the second outbreak of the deadly epidemic in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health Ministry official said to date; no new case has been discovered in Montserrado but that the virus is active in the country. He said there are available equipment to contain the spread of the Ebola virus and called on those within the borders of Liberia to take preventive measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyenswah added that the Ministry of Health is receiving supplies from its partners to fight the virus but added that the major challenge harming the fight against the Ebola virus is denial, myth and religious belief that the disease can't be cured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the BBC quoted WHO that the number of people killed by the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa has risen to 337. It said fourteen deaths and 47 new cases were reported across the region over the past week. Guinea is worst affected with 264 Ebola-related deaths. In Sierra Leone, there have been 49 deaths and in Liberia, 24, the WHO disclosed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigation conducted by this paper has revealed that workers at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town have abandoned the hospital for fear of more deaths from the deadly Ebola virus. The decision of workers to stay away from work has led to the closure of the Hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities at the Ministry of Health told journalists at the Ministry of Information regular press briefing that the hospital was temporarily shut down after nurses decided to stay away, but has since been reopened and was carrying on normal medical operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, Tolbert Nyenswah blamed the brief closure of the hospital on the trauma suffered by nurses and other health workers following the death of their colleague, Esther Kesseley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyenswah said the situation is under control. He said nurses and workers are going about their normal duties at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But contrary to the Minister's assertion, our investigation established that nurses and other health workers at the hospital have decided to stay away from the hospital until the government and the hospital's administration ensure that the entire hospital's environment is sprayed and they (nurses) are supplied the necessary protective gears before returning to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse who chose anonymity (for fear of losing her job) said since the death of their colleague, Esther Kesseley of the deadly Ebola virus, they unconditionally discharged all of the patients that were admitted at the hospital and have refused to accept new patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said their non-corporative action will continue until the government provides them with the needed materials to work with, especially during the 'Ebola crisis' period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses at the Redemption Hospital told reporters Tuesday that their lives were at risk in the performance of their daily duties after the death of their colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses said they work in a risky environment especially in the wake of the reported outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the New Kru Town community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assertions and stay-away action of the Redemption nurses and other workers also contradict comments by the Hospital's Interim General Administrator who claimed that the nurses were provided with the necessary protective gears to carry on their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dominic Rennie said the hospital received supplies of protective gears from the Ministry and were being used by the nurses and other workers at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He displayed a cartoon of the supply kept in his office to our reporter and stated that those were intended for his personal use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, minutes after the display of the Interim General Administrator's personal protective gears, nurses at the hospital told reporters that they lacked the necessary protective materials to work with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities recently announced the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Monrovia with one confirmed death of a nurse at the Redemption Hospital, few months after the Ministry declared the country free of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Redemption Hospital workers said their colleague died after apparently coming in contact with an Ebola suspect due to the lack of protective materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all at risk here; we don't have any protective gear to work with here... our friend may have died after coming in contact with an Ebola patient... &quot; Annie Kromah said in tears during brief visit of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to the hospital Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health workers said despite the risky working environment; they remain amongst the less paid civil servants in the country with no insurance benefits. Investigation continues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">608 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola Is Already living with us whether Liberians accept this reality or not, the fact of the matter is that the disease has taken the life of a committed nurse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For too long, Liberians have been pessimistic about their own country and the unfolding reality regarding the existence of Ebola. We are too political about everything nowadays, disregarding the fact that most of these health issues were not created by anyone in this administration or the regimes before this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fact Of the matter is that Liberians were informed about the outbreak of Ebola and the ability of the disease to cause havoc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March this year, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare announced that the epidemic had crossed into Liberia from neighboring Guinea. The death toll in Guinea was alarming, prompting the government to close its borders with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Senegal, which also shut its borders as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organization (WHO) had earlier reported the outbreak of Ebola in the West African sub-region before the Health Ministry announced its presence in Liberia. Since then, the ministry, in collaboration with partners, continues to provide daily briefing on the status of the disease. Yet, folks from political and civil society institutions as well as those from the National Legislature often made comments suggesting that Ebola issue was a farce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Ebola Has struck a nurse who, unfortunately, was diagnosed of the virus after she had treated an Ebola carrier unprotected. Esther Kesseley died over the weekend at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town. Her colleagues said she was a dedicated health worker who died while serving humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf visited the hospital and sympathized with the administration and the entire medical staff. The President, apparently concerned about the rapidity of the disease, interrupted the Vice President of the hospital's workers union, Rev. Samuel Farley from making what she thought would have been a political statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According To The Health Ministry/WHO report, the total number of suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola cases reported in Liberia since the onset of the outbreak is 28. However, according to the recent United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report, the total number of Ebola related deaths now stand at 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These Accounts, Including the recent death of a nurse at Redemption hospital are sufficient information to inform every Liberian about the existence of the virus in the country. This is not a matter that our people should be political about; it is a life and death situation. Hence, those who want to engage in the politics of game blame would be na&iuml;ve to ignore the first law of nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along These Lines, we call on the government and international partners to consider providing protective gears and other support to workers. We know that the task before the government in handling the Ebola crisis is tedious; therefore, we urge foreign governments and organizations to assist Liberia through its Health Ministry with financial and logistical support for our health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Want To encourage President Johnson Sirleaf to remain constructively engaged with the health workers (by dialoguing with them on how some of their concerns can be addressed) so that they can be motivated and inspired to go beyond the call of duty. We must understand that the Ebola virus does not have respect for age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We Urge Our citizens including politicians and civil society leaders to join us in asking the Liberian government to provide protective gears for health workers across the country rather than questioning the existence of the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf visited Redemption hospital amid reports of ebola fear, she used the conference with nurses and health workers to rebuff individuals to desist from mixing the current health crisis (the ebola situation) with politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader had gone to the hospital to sympathize with the hospital's administration following the reported death of a nurse from the deadly Ebola virus recently in Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There President Sirleaf met briefly with nurses and other health workers to discuss issues regarding the hospital and the death of their colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the brief meeting with the nurses turned sour when President Johnson-Sirleaf quickly interrupted the Vice President of the Redemption Hospital Workers' Union, Rev. Samuel Faley, who had mentioned the dismissal of the National President of the Health Workers Association of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faley had attempted to express the grievances of his colleagues to the President when he was abruptly interrupted. He stated: &quot;We're not happy to hear about the sudden death of our colleague Esther Kesseley who was diagnosed positive of Ebola. This dedicated health worker died serving humanity... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said health workers remain vulnerable without insurance and other benefits while delicately serving and performing their duties on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interruption came when Faley remarked, &quot;To see our national president and secretary being fired... &quot; apparently angered President Sirleaf, prompting her to angrily interrupt him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader replied that she had not gone to the hospital for politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Johnson-Sirleaf said: &quot;I didn't come here for politics; I came here for two reasons, to sympathize with you and to thank you for the services you're rendering to our people, if you want to bring politics into it, then it don't belong here... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses and health workers were heard murmuring amongst themselves in an apparent dissatisfaction and disappointment to the Liberian leader's response to the plight of their national leaders. The health workers were seen lamenting the death of their colleague from the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting further, President Johnson-Sirleaf said: &quot;You choose to be health workers and we honor you for that... because health workers have a particular commitment to humanity, that's what you chose to be... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Johnson-Sirleaf said the government acknowledges that health workers deserve better livelihood and they remain committed to ensuring that such goal is achieved on a gradual basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told health workers to also work with the government in a more constructive way to address situations affecting the country's health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that two officials of the National Health Workers Association were dismissed by health authorities for reportedly masterminding a nationwide strike action. Health and Social Welfare Minister Dr. Walter Gweinegale has refused to have the two officials reinstated despite calls by the National Legislature for the Minister to so do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the first seven cases of ebola deaths in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, have been confirmed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and the World Health Organization Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the deaths were released at the weekend following an emergency meeting to discuss confirmation of Ebola cases and deaths in the densely populated community of New Kru Town, situated out of the city center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total number of confirmed Ebola cases reported in Liberia since the onset of its outbreak in the country is 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports say one of the seven deaths was a woman who recently traveled from an infected area in Sierra Leone and is believed to have passed the disease on to others in the house where she resided in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Ministry of Health convened an emergency meeting to discuss confirmation of Ebola cases and deaths in New Kru Town community. Most Liberians did not believe that the Health Ministry information was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT HAS ONCE again been reported that the deadly Ebola disease has resurfaced in Liberia.The deadly disease has claimed the lives of some individuals in Montserrado County, while others are reportedly undergoing medication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RECENT VICTIM of this disease is a patient who reportedly died at the Redemption Hospital in the Borough of New Kru Town. It is reported that the nurse who was caring for the dead Ebola victim at the hospital also got infected with the disease and eventually died days after. This news is scaring especially in a jammed packed community like New Kru Town where everybody seems to be closed to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CURRENTLY SOME EMPLOYEESat the Hospital are expressing fear of contracting the deadly disease, which they believe may be in Montserrado County and its environs, especially following the death of their patient and colleague health worker. The situation is so alarming that Montserrado County District # 16 Representative,Edward Forh, has reported that the outbreak in recent time has claimed the lives of some citizens, including a nurse. He said the existence of the disease was confirmed by the Health Ministry, growing out of an incident in an area in the Borough, based on claim that it was spread by a lady who came from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE STATED FURTHER that there is a search for another victim whose body was secretly taken away. Rep. Forh said a search is also on for a wheelbarrow operator who took one of the bodies to the hospital. Representative Forh spoke yesterday during the father's day program at the Trinity United Methodist Church in New KruTown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE LAWMAKER SAID this information is not to create fear in the people but to create the awareness for people to be aware. He then called on the residents to be guided by all measures announced by the Ministry during the first outbreak.He said a meeting is planned today with authorities of the Health Ministry at the Town Hall beginning at 4 p.m. on the Ebola issue. He said the Borough will also today begin a sensitization campaign on the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LET'S FIRST EXTEND thanks and commend the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for the first step it took in creating a massive awareness from the initial stage when the case of the deadly Ebola was first reported in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EQUALLY SO,WE are calling on the Ministry to intensify its awareness, not just in communities where cases of Ebola are reported but throughout the length and breadth of this nation and put in place the necessary remedy or solution that will help curtail the spread of this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH AUTHORITIES CONCERNED should now strengthen and institute all measures necessary to help avoid the spread of this deadly disease as was done in the past when the disease was initially discovered and confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT THE SAME time Liberians should learn to believe that this disease exists and stop playing 'Doubting Thomases'or denying the existence of this deadly disease. Liberians must abide by measures announced by the Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEST WE FORGET, prevention is better than cure. Therefore, Liberians must take this seriously and avoid denying its existence or making mockery of it. A hint to the wise is quite sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone shut its borders to trade with Guinea and Liberia on Wednesday and closed schools, cinemas and nightclubs in a frontier region in a bid to halt the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone, a figure that has doubled in the last week, Ministry of Health figures showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities will also mount health checkpoints in the eastern Kailahun district and mandated that all deaths there be reported before burial. Anyone who dies of the virus must be buried under the supervision of health personnel, the Information Ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to close district schools came after a nine-year-old whose parents died of Ebola tested positive for the virus, Deputy Minister of Information Theo Nicol told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is more contacts between school-going kids than adults hence the closure of schools in the most affected district,&quot; he said. The ban exempted churches and mosques but religious leaders should urge anyone with a fever to go to a clinic, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local groups welcomed the measures given public concern over the virus, which can be transmitted by touching victims or their body fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus initially causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain and conjunctivitis, before moving to severe phases that bring on vomiting, diarrhoea and internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 328 cases and 208 deaths are linked to Ebola in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization, making the outbreak one of the deadliest for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of new deaths in Guinea were in the southern region of Gueckedou, epicentre of the outbreak which began in February, near the Sierra Leone and Liberian borders. The town is known for its weekly market which attracts traders from neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said these were the pieces of information that she was giving to the House when she was engaged by Representative Darkel that she was &quot;reckless&quot; in her deliberation with others laughing when she was asked a question by the Presiding Officer of the day in session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Youngblood reiterated that she was quiet surprise and when the presiding asked her on how did the information she was giving fit in the discussion on the floor, saying that she was surprised at the Presiding Officer because the discussion at the time was centering on Ebola, while she informing the body how some expected international guests were prevented from coming to Liberian because of fear of Ebola's presence in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was never reckless; I gave out information to the floor of Plenary that I had a group of delegation coming to Liberia from the state of Dallas,&quot; Madam Youngblood lamented, indicating, &quot;I received a call from the councilman Dwain Call away from Dallas stating that they can not come to Liberia because of the reported case of the Ebola in Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The female Montserrado County lawmaker said the delegation was to make an official visit to Liberia out of her initiative when she made a private trip to the United States at which time she visited the City of Dallas was at her own expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Madam Youngblood indicated that when she visited Dallas she dedicated that Liberian Flag for the first time to be hosted in that City, noting that in reciprocation of this private trip of hers, the Dallas mayor and a councilman were scheduled to Liberia as her official guest, their trip was aborted due to the news of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I expected I was expecting the delegation, I was only called and told that the trip of the Dallas Mayor and Councilman was called off because of the deadly virus Ebola news from Liberia,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining further, Representative Youngblood stated that, since Liberia was founded in 1847, the Liberian Flag has never been hoisted or flown in the City of Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Dallas being a Lone Star State of the United States just as Liberia is in Africa, she went there to dedicate the Liberian Flag so that it will also be flown in that City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Representative She disclosed that the delegation was coming to Liberia because she gave a position on the business opportunities in Liberia, having in mind the more than 80% of unemployed population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that such could nurture bilateral relations between Monrovia-Liberia and the City of Dallas in the United States, Youngblood added that she was linking the abortion of this all important visit to Liberia by the Dallas delegation noting that that this start of a relationship between Liberia and Dallas was hampered because of the Ebola alarm which aborted the visit of the delegation to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Representative Youngblood have already apologize to Representative Darkel and the House Plenary, she was notwithstanding mandated by Presiding Officers S.Gayah Karmo to make her apology formal and open so that it will be read in Plenary on Tuesday, June 10, 2014 which, which the Representative accepted to do according to the House Plenary's rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Why Are We So Negative About Ourselves? the Case of the Ebola Virus [column]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1206 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes ago in January this year, I carried this similar headline when it was reported that Finance Minister, Amara Konneh, had won an international award. The headline at the time was prompted by claims by some individuals that the minister did not deserve the honor. One of them claimed that there are other African finance ministers who are doing better than the Liberian Finance Minister. The person went on calling names of some of the African finance ministers, who he believed should have been given that award by the magazine, rather than Minister Konneh, &quot;because he does not deserve it.&quot; I was even told on January 6 upon reaching my office that the issue was one of discussion on one of the local radio stations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually there have always been debates whenever such an honor or recognition is given to a Liberian. Sometimes we will see a Liberian struggling to succeed in life, and whenever such person is successful, we derogatorily say all kinds of things, and may even go on accusing that person of dubious dealings for the successes in life. Furthermore, at times, we are cynical and skeptical of the success of our fellow compatriots. I recall once that a Liberian lady who acted with movie star Steve Segal, came to Liberia to visit her mother on Carey Street, opposite the National Fire Service, and that people doubted that she was a Liberian. The late Fran&ccedil;ois Junius, then the promoter, had to clarify that the lady was indeed a Liberian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of being negative is not just limited to people. Some of us even say all kinds of things about the countries that are fallacious. During my recent visit to the United States last May, I was confronted with an issue concerning the Vai Town Bridge. While visiting the Embassy staff, I was asked whether it was true that the Vai Town Bridge is so small that no vehicle was playing the bridge. I was shocked to hear about that negative news being spread by some Liberians. I explained that that was not true, and that cars were using the bridge. I can remember telling Mr. Gabriel Williams, the Minister Consular at the Embassy that he could quote me on the issue, since the Embassy was working on a newsletter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my previous article on this similar issue, I pointed out that one of my disappointments about some of us as Liberians is the way and manner in which we speak of some of our compatriots who are making success in life. I said then that many times we condescendingly say all things about them as if they do not deserve the accolade they have received in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of popping up Liberians who are leapfrogging in life, some of us always engage in what is referred to as &quot;CRABS IN THE BUCKET&quot; mentality than is, if 'it is not me, it must not be him.&quot; Sometimes we create the impression that people in other countries are better than us, and so whenever a Liberian is distinguishably recognized, people get all kinds of negative things to say about the person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unarguably, the same way we treat our fellow compatriots whenever they win such awards, is the same article we exhibit whenever there are serious issues in the country. We are being noted for making mockery of very serious issues, and at times create the impression that that is obtaining is not true. We always trivialize these issues, to an extent that we are becoming to be known as &quot;people who do not take anything serious.&quot; Sometimes I hear people say, &quot;we make fun of everything; we do not take anything serious in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, I am reflecting on what I previously said to bring to focus the issue of the Ebola virus which spread to Liberia from neighboring Guinea. The virus which claimed the lives of some Liberians is something some Liberians seem to doubt its existence. For some, it was used to raise funds or to ingratiate or conciliate the international community for some funds or items, as there existed no such thing as EBOLA VIRUS, as claimed by the Liberian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although I heard people expressing misgivings about the existence of this in Liberia, I am mainly concerned of this because a high-profile person in society, who is part of the status quo, expressed similar doubts about the existence of this disease and is of the same view as some of the lay persons in society. Some even claimed that they did not see any EBOLA dead person and so this is not true, but a make up, fabrication or concoction. What an act of stupidity!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the field of Mass Communication, especially so as it relates to news gathering and reporting, when certain people, because of their &quot;status&quot; or level of &quot;prominence&quot; in society, or when opinion leaders make certain comments, there is a need to take them seriously because people often listen, and sometimes lend credence to whatever they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am commenting on this because of the news I heard about the number of persons that have died in neighboring guinea, as a result of the outbreak of the disease. Yesterday, it was reported by local radio that the WHO has said that more than 200 persons died in that country because this outbreak, while in Liberia, about four persons were only killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, up till now, some of us still cannot believe this outbreak in our country. Instead of giving ourselves, including the government, especially the Health Ministry a pat on the back, for taking the necessary activities and steps that prevented the spread of the disease, we are busy expressing doubts about its existence. We, as a people and nation, should be proud that because of the way and manner in which we acted, it did not claim the lives of many of our citizens, as it is today in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing I know, if the government had not acted swiftly, it could have been condemned for the deaths of many Liberians. Now that it acted appropriately, some still have disbelief of this outbreak. But this is Liberia; if you do, you are doomed, if you don't, you are doomed. As the NEW DEMOCRAT would say; &quot;THIS TOO IS LIBERIA,&quot; is a country of peculiarities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first place, is there anything wrong with Liberians getting the credit the works of their compatriots, or the country being proud for preventing the spread of EBOLA? Why can't we be proud that through our collective actions, EBOLA, a deadly disease was not catastrophic, as it did in other countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As human beings, we are all made in the image of God, and so for some of us to always feel inferior to others is sad. We should always feel that we can do what others can do. My late philosophy professor, Dr. Dr. Wollor Topor, once spoke of the universality of education, and that what others can do, we can also do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, on the issue of the EBOLA, let us give ourselves, this country a pat on the back for preventing its spread. I saw how Minister Walter Gwenigale, my Methodist brother Torbor Nyensuah, my friend John Sumo and others assiduously worked around the clock for public education and awareness, and so to see people, including a high profile person, making mockery because it did not claim more lives, is unfortunate and sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until, we Liberians can realize that we can do what others can do and that all is not lost in this country, despite our differences, we would always see others and other countries as being better than us, I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH mining company has evacuated non-essential staff from Sierra Leone amid growing fears an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus could spread.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday London Mining said it has imposed travel limits around its mine 75 miles east of the capital Freetown and was closely monitoring the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes after the families of several infected patients forcibly removed them from rural clinics to be treated by traditional healers. There is concern their actions will spread the disease further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incurable and highly contagious virus was reported in the west African country last week and 50 suspected cases have been identified. Five people have died and there have been more than 100 deaths in neighbouring Guinea where the outbreak began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London Mining said its output had not been affected and no cases of Ebola had been found around its Marampa iron ore mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said eight staff left at the weekend and those abroad on holiday had been advised not to return for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the firm was screening all staff and visitors to its sites and has medication and equipment at the mine ready to deal with any suspected cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Minerals, another British firm mining iron ore in Sierra Leone, said it has imposed travel restrictions on workers but operations were continuing as normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theo Nicol, deputy information minister, said all suspected cases in Freetown had tested negative so far. Symptoms of Ebola include internal and external bleeding, diarrhoea and vomiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travel information from the Foreign Office warns of the outbreak but does not advise against going to the region.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOUNTING fears about the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone have sparked a sell-off in miners focused on the West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London Mining dropped 5&frac34;, or 13.8pc, to a record low of 36p after the Aimlisted iron ore group said it had imposed travel restrictions on workers and that some &quot;non essential&quot; staff had left the country following the recent outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company, which produces ore from the Marampa mine, said: &quot;Restrictions have been imposed on non-essential travel by visitors from affected areas and some personnel who are able to work remotely, with operations personnel remaining in country and operations running as normal.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been no cases of the virus in its workforce or in communities near Marampa, the company added. A spokesman insisted that, contrary to reports, there had not been an operation to remove workers from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, African Minerals, another Sierra Leone iron ore producer, tumbled 8, or 7.6pc, to 97p, after confirming that it had severed transport links to areas where Ebola had been reported. Like London Mining, African Minerals said that staff and operations at its Tonkolili mine had been unaffected by the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both companies have put protective measures in place after Sierra Leone last week became the third West African country to be struck by the Ebola outbreak. There have been five deaths in Sierra Leone, and at least 193 in Guinea, where the epidemic began. There have also been cases in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no vaccine or treatment for Ebola, which is transferred by coming into direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. The disease is among the world's most virulent, killing as many as 90pc of those who catch it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After edging cautiously higher on Monday, the FTSE 100 went into reverse and closed down 27.8 points at 6,836.3. Nervousness ahead of tomorrow's key European Central Bank meeting - when the ECB is expected to tackle deflation - weighed on equities across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In London, William Hill, 7&frac12; cheaper at 350.3p, was among the heaviest fallers, dragged down by the bookmaker's impending demotion from the FTSE 100 as well as worries about increases in racefield fees in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hill has a sizeable operation Down Under. To account for the fee rises, Goodbody analyst Gavin Kelleher yesterday trimmed his 2015 earningsper-share forecast for Hill by 1.7pc. FTSE Group will disclose the results of the latest quarterly index reshuffle today, with the moves determined by the market caps of companies at the close of trade last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Melrose Industries, down 4.6 at 275.3p, is expected to lose its place in the FTSE 100 along with Hill, while 3i, 1.4 lower at 426p, and Intu Properties, up 1.7 at 318.4p, are in line for promotion from the FTSE 250.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reshuffle affects share prices, as tracker funds are forced to adjust their holdings to account for the index changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grocers were under pressure following unsettling sales and market shares data from Kantar Worldpanel, which HSBC described as &quot;shocking&quot; for the three listed supermarket groups. Wm Morrison lost 4.2 to 194.4p, J Sainsbury shed 5.3 to 333.8p and Tesco, which reports first-quarter numbers today, slid 3.05 to 297&frac12;p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere among the fallers, microchip designer Imagination Technologies was off 6.9 at 226.7p after traders picked up on news that one of its licensees, Broadcom, plans either to sell or to wind-down its cellular baseband unit. The business, which develops chips used in smartphones, could have given a boost to Imagination's royalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unexpected departure of Foxtons' chief executive Michael Brown, who has been at the helm for 12-years, sent the London-focused estate agency down 21.9 to 307.9p. He is leaving the company for personal reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conversely, Tullett Prebon advanced 13.8 to 304p, despite news that boss Terry Smith, the City heavyweight, is to exit the interdealer broker. Bid talk was thought to have stoked demand for the shares, with Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, noting that Smith's departure could leave the group &quot;vulnerable&quot; to a takeover, given there is a growing &quot;need&quot; for consolidation in the wider IDB industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beazley, 1.1 better at 248.7p, was another that was lifted by broker comment. Recommending that clients &quot;buy&quot; shares in the Lloyd's of London insurer, Berenberg analyst Tom Carstairs said: &quot;Beazley's diversified business model, with a lower reliance on reinsurance business and a significant portion of liability business, leaves it well placed to maintain its very strong results of recent years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil explorer Cairn Energy was boosted 5.9 to 206.9p by speculation of positive developments in its Indian tax dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow oil and gas group Bowleven surged 3&frac14;, or 9.6pc, to 37p after Cameroon gave its approval for the Aimlisted group's plans to exploit for the Etinde prospect off the coast of the African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company, a favourite among punters on the internet bulletin boards, wants to supply gas to a government-backed fertiliser plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wolseley was another riser, topping the FTSE 100 leaderboard in the wake of a well-received third-quarter trading update, in which the heating and plumbing products supplier said it expected like-for-like revenue growth of about 4pc in the coming six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traders said that Wolseley's robust performance in America also pleased, as there had been worries that the third-quarter could have been hurt by the adverse weather in the US. The shares finished 53p dearer at &pound;33.63.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few viruses can boast of being the inspiration for hit dance tunes. But then ebola - which can kill up to 90% of victims, has no vaccine or cure, and causes horrific internal and external bleeding - is not your average pathogen. When an epidemic struck west Africa's music-crazy nations of Guinea and Liberia, it spawned mass panic - and the outbreak of a new dance accompanied to a infectious rap song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola, Ebola in town. Don't touch your friend! No kissing, no eating something. It's dangerous!&quot; warns the chorus of Ebola in Town, looped over a catchy, trippy electro-dance beat. At one point, the rapper describes an attempt to escape ebola by fleeing to neighbouring Guinea only to discover, in lyrics that suggest a stalking ex-lover, the disease lurking there too.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clubbers bitten by the musical bug have come up with a &quot;no touching&quot; jig in roadside bars of the capital, Monrovia. &quot;With such a high illiteracy rate, and such important messages to get across, sometimes a catchy or humorous song is the best way. &quot; said bank manager Ethel Knuckles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such musical comic relief follows in the tradition of others such as Ivory Coast's Crazy Chicken dance, inspired by the bird flu virus. As well as providing comic relief, in a region with weak public health systems the ebola song also communicates vital information needed to curb the virus, which is spread through contact with fluids of infected people or animals, like urine, blood and saliva. This week, Sierra Leone confirmed four people had died in a district that borders southern Guinea, where the outbreak began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers have raced to contain ebola. When it appeared in Guinea this March - from where it later jumped to Liberia - popular text messages claimed an antidote could be found in of a concoction of hot chocolate, coffee, milk, sugar and raw onions. In Liberia, many initially dismissed ebola as a way for health officials to rake in money. Few took official advice to abstain from sex - coyly referred to as &quot;no eating something&quot; in the song - seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosted by fruit bats, a local delicacy, the &quot;molecular shark&quot; has so far killed 145 people, around two thirds in Guinea. &quot;Timing and appropriate healthcare are crucial to whether ebola spreads, and whether victims survive. It needs to be taken very seriously but there's a tendency for people to develop a kind of paranoid psychosis about ebola,&quot; said Sakouba Keita of Guinea's health ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who do beat the odds, Ebola in Town's call for &quot;no touching&quot; pre-empts the stigma that often awaits. Health workers say the terrified reactions towards survivors recall the early days of the HIV epidemic, and can even affect relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bakary's case, he went to the mosque to offer a thanksgiving prayer when his brother-in-law survived. &quot;I was instantly left standing alone in the mosque. In broad daylight, people were treating me like a leper,&quot; the civil servant said. &quot;My boss put me on forced sick leave and I haven't been called back yet.&quot; The family's children were pulled out of their private school after other parents told their classmates to avoid them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An added complication is that medics on the frontline often face the greatest prejudice. &quot;You have to be scared of anyone who goes around dressed up like a cosmonaut,&quot; said Fanta Mamadou, a market trader in Nzerekore, Guinea's second city, where residents initially refused to open their doors to medics dressed head-to-toe biohazard suits. Communities with little knowledge of the virus attacked a treatment clinic at the centre of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stigmatisation has now become the main challenge we are dealing with,&quot; said Marc Poncin, emergency co-ordinator of Medecins sans Frontieres, whose suspected or confirmed cases have dwindled to seven in Guinea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Health Organisation warns that Ebola is still spreading across West Africa nearly two months after outbreak was reported</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of Ebola patients in Sierra Leone have been removing their loved ones from community health centres despite protests from medical staff, amid warnings from the World Health Organisation that the deadly and highly infectious disease is still spreading across West Africa nearly two months after an outbreak was first reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea's capital Conakry has recorded its first new Ebola cases in more than a month, while five people have died in Sierra Leone's first confirmed outbreak of Ebola virus, according to the WHO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of the outbreak, which Guinean authorities had said had been contained, risks further complicating the fight against the virus in a region already struggling with weak healthcare systems and porous borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is serious, you can't say it is under control as cases are continuing and it is spreading geographically,&quot; Dr Pierre Formenty, a WHO expert who recently returned from Guinea, told a news briefing in Geneva on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no decline. In fact it is because we are not able to capture all the outbreak that we were under the impression there was a decline,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, the family of one woman said they removed her from the clinic in Koindu town, in the country's east, because they did not trust the medical system and feared she would die if a planned transfer to the general hospital in the town of Kenema went ahead, Amara Jambai, the health ministry's director of disease prevention and control, told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Jambai told the BBC that a total of six patients had been &quot;aggressively&quot; removed from care in Koindu, in defiance of medical staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever with a fatality rate of up to 90%, is believed to have killed almost 200 people in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia since March in the first deadly appearance of the disease in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West African outbreak spread from a sparsely inhabited corner of Guinea to the capital, Conakry, and into Liberia, causing panic across a region struggling with weak healthcare systems and porous borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about the risk posed by the woman's removal from hospital in Kenema, Jambai said: &quot;She can infect others, her family members and also those in the community. There is no news of her condition because she has been taken away so we need to search and find her and make sure that it (Ebola) doesn't spread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jambai said lawmakers and community leaders would try to talk to family members and persuade them to return her to hospital. There has been no news of the woman, whose identity has been kept secret, since she was taken from Koindu to her village nearby, Jambai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Guinea, Telimele and Boffa - two districts north of Conakry that were previously untouched by the disease - both confirmed outbreaks through laboratory testing, the WHO said. Twelve cases, including four deaths, were reported there between 23 and 26 May, while suspected Ebola infections were documented in the adjacent districts of Boke and Dubreka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aboubacar Sidiki Diakit&eacute;, who heads the Guinean government's efforts to halt the virus's spread, said the origins of all the new outbreaks had been traced back to cases in Conakry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that there are families that refuse to give information to health workers. They hid their sick to try to treat them through traditional methods,&quot; he told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO has documented a total of 281 clinical cases of Ebola, including 185 deaths in Guinea since the virus was first identified as Ebola in March. The disease is thought to have killed 11 people in Liberia, thought there have been no new cases there since 9 April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is endemic to Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Uganda and South Sudan. Researchers believe the West African outbreak was caused by a new strain of the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Minister of Preventive Services at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Tolbert Nyensuah, has said that Liberia has gone 42 days without any suspected cases of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to the Liberia Broadcasting System (LBS) yesterday, Minister Nyensuah said they are putting all preventive measures into place to make sure that all counties bordering Sierra Leone be aware of the Ebola breakout in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that they are doing all they can to contact health authorities in neighboring Sierra Leone to confirm the suspected cases of Ebola. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is trying to get a team of health workers at the border towns with Sierra Leone to create awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a regional disease and we are concerned. We are still creating awareness so that our people can take preventive measures,&quot; Minister Nyensuah stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As health authorities step up their surveillance after reports of suspected cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone, Liberians are afraid that the deadly disease will undoubtedly cross over into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola which was noticed in neighboring Guinea later spread to Liberia and led to the death of some citizens. As the fear of Ebola returns to the Liberian populace, they are calling on the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to act quickly and deploy health workers at the Sierra Leone border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While others are saying the Government of Liberia should close the border to stop people from entering Liberia from neighboring Sierra Leone, others are of the view that the border must be closely monitored as was the case during the Ebola outbreak in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sierra Leone has confirmed four deaths in eastern Sierra Leone due to the Ebola outbreak in the country. The deaths occurred in Kailahun District which borders Gueckedou in Guinea where the outbreak started in March.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DEADLY Ebola virus could solve France's immigration problems &quot;in three months&quot;, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder and honorary president of France's far-Right Front National, said in remarks which shocked the country's political establishment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday night in Marseille, shortly before a joint rally with Marine Le Pen, his daughter and current party leader, Mr Le Pen, 85, said: &quot;There is a demographic explosion in the world and a risk of submersion. A replacement of [the national] population is under way.&quot; However, he added: &quot;Monsieur Ebola can solve the problem in three months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An outbreak in Guinea of the viral haemorrhagic fever, for which there is no effective treatment or vaccine, has crossed international borders for the first time, killing at least 83 people in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Le Pen, who is running for the European Parliament in France's South East constituency, made the inflammatory remarks during an exchange with French journalists. He went on to tell a crowd of 1,500 that France's immigration situation was &quot;made worse&quot; by the fact that most immigrants were Muslim, &quot;a religion whose aim is to conquer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola comments led to outrage in France, where St&eacute;phane Le Foll, a spokesman for the Socialist government, called them &quot;unacceptable&quot; and added: &quot;For those who often make out that the Front National has changed, here is the proof once again that they have not changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They threatened to undermine Miss Le Pen's efforts to &quot;detoxify&quot; her party and shed its reputation for racism. Mr Le Pen later back-pedalled, saying he was merely making an &quot;observation&quot; about potential disasters that &quot;could modify this demographic trend&quot; and added: &quot;In no way do I wish to spread the Ebola virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Le Pen is aiming to come first in Sunday's European elections in France, where the FN is polling neck and neck with the centre-Right UMP party and well ahead of the ruling Socialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her father's remarks will also hinder her effort to forge alliances with other nationalist or Eurosceptic parties, which are expected to make sweeping gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has previously ruled out joining forces with the FN because it had anti-Semitism &quot;in its DNA&quot;. After Mr Le Pen's comments, Mr Farage said: &quot;I almost feel sorry for Marine Le Pen. I cannot understand what she has done to make her father dislike her so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But these comments just reconfirm what I have always said - that Ukip will not be having any sort of pact with the Front National after these elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France's far-right Front National, has suggested the deadly virus Ebola could solve the global &quot;population explosion&quot; and by extension Europe's &quot;immigration problem&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a cocktail party before an election rally in Marseille on Tuesday evening, just days before the European elections in which the FN is leading the polls in France, Le Pen spoke of the &quot;demographic explosion&quot; in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monseigneur Ebola could sort that out in three months,&quot; he said in front of journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, addressing supporters, Le Pen, 85, said he feared the French population risked being &quot;replaced ... by immigrants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our country and in all Europe, we have known a cataclysmic phenomenon - a migratory invasion that, my friends, we are seeing only the beginning of today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Pen, who is standing as MEP for the south-east seat, added: &quot;This massive immigration risks producing a real replacement of populations if we don't arrive in power soon enough to put an end to the politics of decadence that has been followed for decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that religion added an &quot;aggravating factor&quot; to this problem because many immigrants were Muslim and Islam had a &quot;conquering vocation ... and even more conquering when it feels strong and they feel numerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Marseille, which elected an FN mayor in one of its districts in recent elections, Le Pen was followed on stage by his daughter, party president Marine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, her father undermined her campaign to convince voters the FN has evolved from its days as a vehicle for the extreme right and Nazi apologists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking the microphone, Marine Le Pen continued with the twin pillars of the party's manifesto: the anti-immigration and anti-Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's enough. We wish to become masters in our own home once again,&quot; she told the cheering audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that France was caught between &quot;two steel jaws&quot;, saying: &quot;On one side we have the importing of foreign cultures by a wave of foreigners who, unlike those who came before wish to impose a change on our behaviour and our lives. On the other side, there are the European commissioners who force their crazy administration on every aspect of our daily lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion polls have suggested that the FN could score between 23% and 25% of the vote in France this Sunday, beating the opposition centre-right UMP party and the ruling Socialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Marie Le Pen has been accused and convicted several times of xenophobia and antisemitism. In February 2005, a court in Paris ruled that his remarks about Muslims in an interview with Le Monde constituted an incitement to racial hatred and he was fined (EURO)10,000 (&pound;8,100) plus (EURO)5,000 in damages. The conviction and fines were upheld on appeal. In 1987, Le Pen said he supported the forced isolation of those infected with the HIV virus. In June 1996 he complained that the French World Cup football team contained too many non-white players.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia Refugee Repatriation and Resettlement Commission's attention has been drawn to a story titled &quot;Ebola Stalls Repatriation In Grand Gedeh&quot; as a result of outbreak of Ebola in the country published in the May 5, 2014 Edition of the New Democrat Newspaper allegedly quoting the Commission's Grand Gedeh County Coordinator, Mr. Joseph Cooper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cooper has meanwhile categorically denied ever granting interview to reporters about halting repatriation in Grand Gedeh County because of Ebola Virus and has described the New Democrat Newspaper story as baseless, unfounded and without any iota of truth; intended to create unnecessary fear amongst the citizenry and the Ivorian refugee population in Grand Gedeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a clarification, Mr. Cooper said that the issue of repatriation came about during a briefing session with Information Minister Lewis Browne in the presence of Grand Gedeh County Superintendent, Mr. Peter L. Solo at which time he informed the Minister that repatriation is on hold in grand Gedeh due to a request from the Ivorian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the briefing session, a copy of the request from the Ivorian Government addressed to UNHCR Country Representative, Khassim Diagne was exhibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand Gedeh County Superintendent, Mr. Solo has meanwhile, reiterated the absence of the Ebola Virus in the county, quoting Liberia medical authorities. He further clarified that the issue relating to voluntary repatriation lies with UNHCR and a reciprocal measure due to the reported negative behavior of Ivorian security at the B'hai border on the Ivorian side which was reported by Liberian security agencies on three separate occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Solo disclosed that communication on the issue has been forwarded to Liberia's Minister of Internal Affairs for his intervention and advice.</SPAN></P>
