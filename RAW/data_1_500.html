</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">382 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE threat of a triple-dip recession in the eurozone, civil unrest in China and the Ebola crisis have created an unprecedented number of headwinds for the global economy, according to the chief executive of WPP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of the world's largest advertising group by sales, said geopolitical risks &quot;continued to multiply&quot; and had hit confidence among major advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WPP posted a lower than expected increase in like-for-like sales of 3pc in the third quarter, slightly below the consensus of 3.3pc and a first-half rise of 4.1pc, and said it expects sales to slow further in the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's general uncertainty surrounding the global economy. Ebola obviously has created uncertainty, the rise of Isil in Syria and most importantly the demonstrations in Hong Kong,&quot; he said. &quot;China is the engine of economic growth and if it sneezes we all catch a cold. I can't remember a time when there's been so many flashpoints. So I think this just adds to the uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;[In the UK] it was the Scottish referendum. Now we have an EU referendum looming if the Conservatives [win the general election], so I think this just raises the temperature of uncertainty and gives people excuses not to do things. And this is against a background of worldwide growth being below trend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir Martin said WPP had also managed to poach &quot;tons&quot; of clients after the collapsed $35bn (&pound;22bn) merger between Publicis and Omnicom, including telecoms giant Vodafone and brewer AB InBev. &quot;Their eyes were off the ball.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revenue - which the group distinguishes from net sales due to the way it books some income - was up 3.1pc at &pound;2.76bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WPP described stagnant growth and stubbornly low inflation in the eurozone as a &quot;grey swan&quot;, a term Sir Martin has used for forthcoming events that are known about but could still have unknown consequences. However, he said the current weakness could present a buying opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain remained the global bright spot in terms of growth, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm very bullish on the UK, but I do think if we have a referendum it's going to cast a shadow over the UK economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the current recovery was like a &quot;gently rising square root sign&quot;. &quot;Companies are doing well, including ourselves. But it's been a real slog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shares rose 0.8pc &pound;12.18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small talk with other parents outside my four-year-old's school isn't usually difficult. There's the question of how our little youngsters are getting on with their new teacher, and how we parents are juggling the school routine with work. A couple of times recently, though, I've been a bit vague on that latter topic. After all, telling fellow mums and dads that you have just come back from Ebola-hit Liberia is not that easy to drop into casual schoolrun chat. As a conversation-killer, it's up there with saying that rather than trick-or-treating, my daughter and I will be opting for a spot of Satanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before a team of boiler-suited medics beat their path to my house, let me offer a few words of reassurance. I've been to Liberia twice in the last few months, both times reporting on the Ebola outbreak, and yes, it does involve a certain risk. But like other important stories, such as Syria and Iraq, my editor thinks that it's worth taking those risks to keep the public informed. Without the first-hand reports showing people dying outside treatment centres, the response to the crisis might not have been as big as it is now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difference is, of course, that with Ebola, those risks follow you home in a way that bullets, bombs and kidnappers never do. Had I become infected while out there, I could potentially have brought the virus back, and then possibly passed it on to my family and other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luckily, it doesn't quite work that way. While Ebola does have a three-week incubation period, carriers of the virus are only a danger to others once the symptoms start, and even then, the infectiousness is limited in the early stages. The advice from Public Health England, with whom I am obliged to register, is that until that happens, one is fine to continue life as normal - going to work, dropping children off at school, seeing friends, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, it's one thing to sound reassuring in print. It's quite another to reassure parents in a playground, many of whom may still take the view that it is better to be safe than sorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is a price to be paid for erring on the side of caution - as is demonstrated by the case this week of Kaci Hickox, an American volunteer with Medicins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res, who has threatened to sue US officials in New Jersey after they tried to have her compulsorily quarantined when she came back from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. On Thursday, she openly defied them, going for a bike ride in front of the assembled media (some of them following so closely that it was clear they didn't consider her an infection risk).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Hickox's stance has thrown America's rulers into disarray. Siding with her are the White House and disease control experts, who point out that not only is forced quarantine unnecessary, but the stigma and inconvenience also risk deterring aid workers from helping in West Africa. Bitterly critical of her are the likes of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who says that Ebola is too dangerous a threat to count on a &quot;voluntary&quot; system of quarantine. The public, meanwhile, are divided, partly according to whether they see aid workers as selfless heroes who need protection, or as Leftie do-gooders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a journalist for this newspaper, I don't really fall into either category. But I can't help sympathising with Ms Hickox. The first three weeks after coming back from Ebola-land are stressful enough as they are - if one gets a headache, severe cold or attack of the runs, there is always that sneaking worry that it might be something worse. The last thing one needs on top of that is to be treated like some sort of leper - which does happen anyway, albeit most often due to ignorance about the real risks of contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One British public health expert who was out in Sierra Leone recently made a point of saying during a BBC radio interview that he had gone straight back to work the day after returning home. That, however, did not stop the BBC from deciding that it wasn't safe to send a crew to interview him face to face. If they'd said that to a person with HIV, there would have been an outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately, Britain has so far steered clear of the kind of compulsory quarantines favoured by New Jersey, although that's partly because we have so far been spared the kind of Ebola scares that might lead to calls for such measures. Should one happen, though - and I suspect it will - I can only hope that an over-the-top 'elf and safety culture doesn't prevail. We rightly protest when that attitude stops villages holding fetes or children throwing snowballs. We should also protest if it gets in the way of aid workers going out to save lives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE American nurse at the centre of a national battle over quarantine rules for health workers returning from west Africa yesterday won the latest round in her fight not to be forced into three weeks of isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A judge in Maine rejected a request by the state to impose a mandatory quarantine order on Kaci Hickox in a ruling that was being closely followed by politicians and heath chiefs across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox, who has showed no Ebola symptoms and twice tested negative for the disease, had refused to agree to a voluntary home quarantine during the 21-day incubation period since returning home from treating Ebola patients for an aid agency in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Charles LaVerdiere had initially imposed a temporary order requiring Miss Hickox to keep three feet away from people and to avoid public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But after hearing arguments from lawyers for the state and Miss Hickox and evidence from a health expert, he lifted those restrictions ahead of a full hearing to be held on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This decision has critical implication for [Miss Hickox's] freedom, as guaranteed by the US and Maine constitutions, as well as the public's right to be protected from the potential severe harm posed by transmission of this devastating disease,&quot; he noted in a written ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining his decision, he said that the state &quot;has not met its burden at this time to prove by clear and convincing evidence&quot; that limiting her movements was &quot;necessary to protect other individuals from the dangers of infection&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did order that she take part in daily &quot;direct active monitoring&quot; of her health with state officials, keep the authorities informed of any travel plans and immediately report any Ebola symptoms. Miss Hickox has agreed to those conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Soley, the lawyer who represented Miss Hickox in court, hailed the ruling as a victory, noting that she was already following the requirements laid down by the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state police patrol cars that had been stationed outside her home in Fort Kent left within an hour of a ruling that meant that Miss Hickox could move freely in the town. Many residents of the small logging community near the Canadian border had expressed anger at her refusal to follow a voluntary quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their concerns were doubtless deepened as the court also heard that an unnamed room-mate of Miss Hickox in Sierra Leone - presumed to be a foreign health worker - had contracted Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul LePage, the governor of Maine, made clear his disappointment with the ruling but said he would not block Miss Hickox's movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite our best effort to work collaboratively with this individual, she has refused to cooperate with us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As governor, I have done everything I can to protect the health and safety of Mainers. The judge has eased restrictions with this ruling and I believe it is unfortunate. However, the state will abide by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox argued that quarantine restrictions would violate her rights and discourage other aid workers from volunteering to tackle Ebola in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confrontation has become the focal point of a struggle between several US states opting for stringent measures and a federal government wary of discouraging potential medical volunteers to combat the outbreak. Aid agencies said that the fight had already deterred doctors and nurses from signing up as volunteers because they were worried about losing an additional three weeks of work and being shunned when they returned from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have seen a big deterrence,&quot; said Margaret Aguirre, of the International Medical Corps. &quot;People are worried. They don't want to sign up. Hopefully smarter minds will come to the front.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Oxford academic has pulled out of a conference on Ebola and tropical diseases in New Orleans after falling foul of strict quarantine rules. Piero Olliaro, a visiting fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford, was due to present several papers about his research on malaria and river blindness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he was among a dozen experts who had to withdraw after Louisiana said anyone who has been in the west African countries hit by Ebola in the past three weeks would be confined to their hotel rooms. Dr Piero was in Guinea two weeks ago trying to find a site for testing Ebola medication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN OTHER circumstances, it would just have been a young woman taking a bicycle ride with her boyfriend along quiet country lanes through the autumnal splendour of northern Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaci Hickox was followed on her foray by two police cars and a posse of journalists as she defied a quarantine request from the state government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox is the nurse who has returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone showing no symptoms of the disease and is refusing to follow a voluntary home quarantine order requested by Maine for the 21-day incubation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her stand has earned her withering criticism from some neighbours in the small logging town of Fort Kent and put her at the centre of a political, medical and legal debate about how to handle not just Ebola patients but also US health care volunteers returning from the &quot;hot zones&quot; of West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following her bike ride, Paul LePage, Maine's Republican governor, said that negotiations &quot;have failed&quot; and he was understood to have asked a judge to impose a mandatory quarantine on public health grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox, an aid agency volunteer, has said that she will fight any such ruling through the courts and is already represented by two prominent New York civil liberties lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 33-year-old has twice tested negative for Ebola and is monitoring herself for any symptoms of illness, including fever. Medical experts say that it is impossible for anyone to be contagious if they do not have symptoms and even then the disease can only be transmitted at close proximity by bodily fluids. &quot;I am not going to sit around and be bullied by politicians and forced to stay in my home when I am not a risk to the American public,&quot; she said. She argued that &quot;stigmatising&quot; and isolating returning health workers would deter their much-needed travel to Africa and would only fuel irrational fears about how Ebola spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Fort Kent, an isolated community near the Canadian border, there is little sympathy for those principles. &quot;It's causing consternation here,&quot; said Jim Majka. &quot;It's a simple thing. Stay in quarantine until it's over and she's good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Hickox came to national prominence when she was forcibly quarantined in a medical tent outside a New Jersey hospital after flying into Newark airport. The state's combative governor Chris Christie reluctantly sanctioned her release after she threatened to sue him. She does seem to have some backing from President Barack Obama. He has warned that the imposition of overly restrictive measures on returning health workers would undermine American interests by discouraging others from tackling the crisis in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know that the best way to protect Americans from Ebola is to stop the outbreak at its source,&quot; he said during an appearance with US health workers, some of whom have also returned from the region within the last 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chuck Hagel, the defence secretary, ordered that all US troops deployed to support the fight against Ebola in Africa must undergo a mandatory 21-day quarantine on their return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine suffered defeat in its attempts to restrict the movements of a nurse who returned to the state after working with Ebola patients in west Africa, when a judge reversed an earlier ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Maine judge on Friday ruled that Kaci Hickox must comply with monitoring for Ebola symptoms, but lifted an order that she stay away from public gatherings and maintain a 3ft distance from others, though those requirements had complied with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for people in a situation like hers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Maine] has not met its burden at this time to prove by clear and convincing evidence that limiting [Hickox's] movements to the degree requested is 'necessary to protect other individuals from the dangers of infection',&quot; chief district court judge Charles C LaVerdiere wrote in an order posted on Friday afternoon. &quot;[Hickox] currently does not show any symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not infectious.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LaVerdiere had previously issued a temporary order restricting Hickox's movements. Maine officials initially attempted to quarantine Hickox in her home until 10 November, despite the fact that she has shown no symptoms of Ebola and has twice tested negative for the disease, but they backed down after Hickox threatened legal action and hired two civil rights attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very satisfied with the decision,&quot; Hickox said at a press conference after LaVerdiere's ruling. &quot;The three points he is recommending I abide by are three points I still believe are part of this good compromise I believe we can make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full hearing of Hickox's case is scheduled for 4 and 5 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was stopped at Newark Liberty airport a week ago after she arrived from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for Doctors Without Borders caring for Ebola patients. Sierra Leone is one of the three west African countries hit hardest by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary order had required Hickox to abide by guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But the judge's Friday ruling rolled back several of those requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Hickox still must comply with health department monitoring, taking her temperature twice a day and reporting any symptoms, but she doesn't have to avoid public places. She still must coordinate travel with health officials so her monitoring isn't interrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,&quot; LaVerdiere wrote. &quot;However, whether that fear is rational or not, it is present and it is real. [Hickox's] actions at this point, as a healthcare professional, need to demonstrate her full understanding of human nature and the real fear that exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials wanted to restrict Hickox's movements to the town of Fort Kent where she lives, bar her from public gatherings and force her to stay 3ft away from others. Governor Paul LePage, who is currently in a tight election race for his job, had also called Thursday for her to be subject to another blood test. Hickox didn't say whether she would go into town, but said she is &quot;taking things minute by minute,&quot; and that she didn't &quot;want to make anyone uncomfortable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox became the center of a debate on how to treat healthcare workers returning from Ebola-ravaged west African countries after she was detained in Newark, New Jersey. There, she was questioned for hours, and eventually quarantined in a tent outside a hospital with a portable toilet and no shower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey governor Chris Christie backed down on his pledge to keep healthcare workers, and Hickox in particular, in a 21-day quarantine, after she threatened legal action. New Jersey released Hickox on Monday and she was transported via private car more than 600 miles to Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Hickox was in Fort Kent, a town of about 4,100 people near the Canadian border, Maine officials attempted to place her under similar 21-day quarantine measures. The nurse publicly criticized authorities' efforts, arguing the measures infringed on her civil liberties and that such measures weren't grounded in good science. People infected with the Ebola virus are only contagious when they are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and [have] tried to resolve this amicably, but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public, even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,&quot; said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the week, Hickox told authorities she would leave her home if she couldn't reach an agreement with the state, and on Thursday she went for a one-mile bike ride with her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was the first healthcare worker who states attempted to subject to movement restrictions. The measures have been criticized by medical professionals and aid organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States announced heightened restrictions after a New York City doctor was diagnosed with Ebola following his work with patients in west Africa, where the disease has killed nearly 5,000 people. Health officials disclosed after New York City doctor Craig Spencer's diagnosis that he'd traveled around the city of 8.4 million people, going on a three-mile jog, bowling, and taking the subway. Spencer is being treated at Bellevue hospital in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Hickox will remain in Fort Kent, where local residents and officials have had mixed reactions. The police department has fielded almost 40 calls per day about her, about half of which are from concerned citizens, some from out of state. Other locals have supported Hickox, even delivering her a pizza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Hickox says she just wants to relax with her boyfriend. &quot;Tonight, I am going to try to convince Ted to make my favorite Japanese meal, and I think we're going to watch a scary movie.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle to contain the Ebola outbreak has pushed global health into the spotlight. While much has been said about the world's slow response to the crisis, focus has also shifted to the broken health systems that contributed to the epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our latest Global development podcast explores the lessons the Ebola outbreak can teach us about global health inequality, looking at the weaknesses in the current response, the shortfall in global health spending, and the actions required to prevent further outbreaks. The Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, spoke to Dr Marie-Paule Kieny of the World Health Organisation, along with Professor David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Oxfam's Mohga Kamal-Yanni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kieny said it was not enough simply to rebuild the health systems weakened by Ebola; leaders should instead rethink how health sectors operate in developing countries, she argued. &quot;It does definitely need a new way of thinking, not just at a national level but at a global level,&quot; said Kieny. &quot;The worry is that once Ebola goes from the headlines, then we're back to square one until we have the next outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to know what you think. Could the Ebola outbreak be the tipping point for addressing wider global health problems?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What's the story?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Africa is experiencing the biggest outbreak of the Ebola virus ever known, causing thousands of deaths, devastating fragile healthcare systems and damaging the economies of countries, some of which are still recovering from civil war. Infections are thought to be doubling every few weeks. The WHO says there were 13,700 officially registered cases by the end of October, almost all in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, with about 5,000 deaths, but many go unrecorded and the true figure is thought to be two to three times higher. The US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) says that if nothing changes there could be 1.4 million cases by late January. Liberia has shown a slight drop in the numbers, but the WHO has warned this could be temporary. Concerns for countries bordering the epidemic region intensified when a child died of Ebola in Mali, having travelled while sick for hundreds of miles by bus. Outside Africa, two nurses were infected while caring for a patient in Texas who flew from Liberia before exhibiting symptoms, as was a nurse who treated a missionary repatriated to Madrid. The patients died but the nurses recovered. A doctor returning to New York from Liberia also fell sick and triggered new 21-day quarantine restrictions in some states.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">How this happened</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its beginnings in southern Guinea in December 2013, Ebola has spread with lethal effect across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been cases in Nigeria and Senegal. As of 29 October, the WHO put the number of cases as 13,703 and deaths at 4,920 but the figures are uncertain and the true fatality rate is 70%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola outbreaks in the past have generally been in remote rural areas with swift action to isolate the victims able to contain them. The WHO has been criticised for not reacting fast enough to the outbreak: it took three months to diagnose the first cases, and five months more before a public health emergency was declared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial for the New England Journal of Medicine by Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, and Peter Piot, the head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the exceptional spread of the disease was probably down to a number of factors including dysfunctional health systems, high population mobility across state borders, densely populated capitals and lack of trust in authorities after years of armed conflict meaning health advice is not heeded. Fear is also a factor. People are afraid to go to hospital because they think it may be the source of infection. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The issues</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How the disease spreads                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not an air-borne disease and can only be spread from human to human through close contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the disease - in blood, vomit, semen, urine, tears or saliva. The incubation period - the gap between an individual being infected and showing symptoms - is up to 21 days, meaning it is possible for an infected person to travel widely before they know they have the disease. Humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms, which at first are fever, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function and in some cases internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Death of health workers                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of Ebola through bodily fluids puts health workers dealing with such symptoms as vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding at a high risk. By 27 October, 521 health workers had developed the disease across Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, with 272 dead. While pictures of doctors in full body suits and visors treating Ebola patients have been published all over the world, there is in reality not enough protective clothing. The suits are also uncomfortable to wear in hot climates and risk contamination when they are taken off. Most health workers are infected in clinics treating patients they do not know or suspect have Ebola. The first symptoms can resemble malaria, which is common. Some healthcare workers have been staying away from work for fear of the disease, and in Liberia there have been strikes over pay and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     No drugs or vaccine                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, pharmaceutical firms have given Ebola very low priority. Potential drugs and vaccines under development are now being sped into trials. Healthy volunteers in Europe, the US and unaffected African countries have been injected with candidate vaccines to test safety. Three vaccines are expected to be tested in health workers and burial teams at high risk in west Africa in December. Drug trials will soon also be set up there, although there is no certainty that they will work. Stocks of ZMapp, the experimental drug used to treat several international aid workers and medical staff, have run out. That and other drugs are now bring rushed into production, ahead of efficacy data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Healthcare system collapse                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Healthcare in the region was fragile at best before Ebola. Now there is disintegration as staff become ill or stay away for fear of the disease. Infection control and hygiene are major issues. Soap and water are unavailable in some areas. Alcohol hand rubs are needed on a large scale. Isolation facilities are vital to contain Ebola, as are labs for testing because rapid diagnosis is very important. Both are in very short supply. In some places, isolation is nothing more than an area behind a curtain. People with other diseases and women in childbirth are at risk because hospitals are no longer functioning properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       Cultural issues                                          Levels of virus in infected people are highest in the late stage of disease and in dead bodies. The disease has often spread during traditional funeral practices that involve close contact with the corpse. Burial teams in protective clothing are being dispatched to homes to collect and safely dispose of bodies. Another route of transmission has been traditional healing practices, which involve touching. Families are at high risk when they nurse their sick at home, as is traditionally the norm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persuading people to change their cultural practices has been hard. There is little respect for government authority in a region still emerging from civil war and where corruption is rife. Advice that runs counter to cultural practices is resented and in the absence of authority, myth and superstition take over.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">How can I find out more?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheNew England Journal of Medicine published a detailed report written by the WHO's Ebola team to mark nine months since the start of the outbreak. TheWHO itself also produced a compilation of articles in August to mark six months since the first case was formally identified. They examine Ebola's impact on west Africa and warn that without measures to control it, the number of cases will rise fast.M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res provides information on its treatment centres and regular reports from the frontline. The USCentres for Disease Control has information on diagnosis and treatment, and theWorld Bank has put together a report on Ebola's potential economic impact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim they were also told that if they could get photographs of students dressed as Ebola victims or in other controversial outfits, these could make a front-page story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student newspapers that were contacted include the University of Manchester's Mancunian, Bath student newspaper Bath Impact, and Leeds University's The Gryphon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear whether the woman was acting with the knowledge or authority of the Sun. News international have been contacted by the Guardian for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gr&aacute;inne Morrison, one of the editors at the Mancunion, says: &quot;Our editor-in-chief was phoned by a reporter claiming to be from the Sun, who offered him thousands of pounds if he could find a picture of a student dressed up as either &quot;Jihadi John&quot;, a name given to a British member of Isis said to be behind several beheading incidents this year, or Alan Henning, the Salford resident who was killed by Isis at the beginning of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They implied that if we could make that happen, they would reward us and if we wanted to go even further, there would be even more reward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt that it was really shocking and we had to write something about it, because obviously we weren't going to find them a picture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison says she and other students at her paper were particularly offended because Alan Henning was from Greater Manchester and his death had been shocking to the student community there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says: &quot;We felt that they were trying to misrepresent students, by trying to get us to send something that would not only make students look bad but that would also be completely insensitive, especially for Manchester students. Manchester students have been very affected by Alan Henning's execution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Smith, activities officer at Manchester student union, told the Mancunion: &quot;We strongly condemn this journalistic approach which sought to damage the integrity of both our union and the Mancunion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reputational damage to any individual who does end up on the cover of [a paper] could really affect them, and the paper is showing blatant disregard for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Butcher, a reporter at Bath Impact who was also contacted, says: &quot;A woman claiming to be from the Sun phoned on Wednesday afternoon to ask if we were planning on sending any photographers out to cover Halloween events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were told that pictures of 'Jihadi Johns' would be a front-page story, but Ebola victims would also be good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said a substantial financial reward would be offered. They wanted to portray all students as stupid - based on the actions of a few. We wouldn't want to sell out the whole student body like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the Sun published photos of two University of Chester students who won a nightclub's Halloween fancy-dress competition wearing costumes depicting the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The pair were later forced to apologise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares in Barclays have jumped nearly 8% to 239.9p and Royal Bank of Scotland has risen more than 6% to 388.6p after the Bank of England imposed less stringent requirements on how much capital banks must hold compared to their outstanding loans. My colleague Jill Treanor reports:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Osborne is calling on the Bank of England to consider the impact on lending to business and households as it toughens the regime to bolster the financial strength of the banking sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of England wants major banks to be subjected to a regulatory regime intended to prevent them hiding the risks they are taking when granting loans to households and business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a much-anticipated announcement, the Bank of England is requiring the biggest banks to hold 3p of capital for every &pound;1 they lend out by imposing a 3% leverage ratio across the industry almost immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leverage ratio - a way of measuring the financial strength of banks - does not allow banks to make assessments about the risks they face, unlike the capital ratios which allow an assessment of risk to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threadneedle Street's financial policy committee will consult next year to impose an even higher leverage ratio on the biggest banks - such as Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland - which could push the level up to just above 4% from 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Osborne, who had asked the FPC to conduct the review, said that he &quot;fully accepts&quot; the logic for an extra component to be added to the 3% level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said more work needed to be done on understanding what the impact might be on banks and large building societies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time for a recap, after a rather busier Friday than usual.... </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World stock markets have surged after the Bank of Japan raised its monetary stimulus programme in a new attempt to drive inflation upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kurodawarned that Japan has reached a 'critical moment' in its battle against deflation, after announcing that the BoJ will broaden the monetary base by 80 trillion yen per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BoJ will also triple the amount of  exchange traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts it buys, and also buy more long-term Japanese government debt ( the FT has a nice summary ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of more monetary stimulus has cheered investors around the globe. Europe's indices are all sharply higher this afternoon, and Japan's Nikkei earlier leapt by almost 5% to its highest level in seven years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index has hit a new record intraday high in early trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move has also driven the yen down to seven year lows against the US dollar -- it has just hit the &yen;112 to the $1 mark. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treasury announced this morning that it has decided to redeem &pound;218m of war debt. It is also considering repaying &pound;2bn of war debt, as the recent falls in UK borrowing costs make it a profitable move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4% consols&quot; was issued in 1927 by Winston Churchill, then chancellor, to refinance national war bonds originating from the first world war. The Debt Management Office estimates that the nation has paid &pound;1.26bn in interest on these bonds since 1927.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national war bonds, which paid out a rate of interest of 5% initially (cut to 3.5% in 1932), were issued in 1917 as the government sought to raise more money to finance the ongoing cost of the first world war, which started with the issue of the first war loan in November 1914. The bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: &quot;If you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These consols also include some debts dating back to the Crimea War, and losses incurred during the South Sea Bubble.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITV News's Joel Hills has blogged about the plan - here's a flavour:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In value terms the bulk of Britain's First World War bonds are held by big City institutions, but over 100,000 War Bonds are worth less than &pound;1,000 and are held by ordinary members of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases these bonds will have been passed down through the generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their value has been slowly eroded by inflation (&pound;100 in 1914 is worth around &pound;3,000 now) and the returns today are almost derisory (a War Bond of &pound;100 pays out &pound;3.50 in annual interest). But I imagine the sentimental value is immense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda has warned that Japan's battle against deflation has reached a 'critical moment'. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at a press conference in Toyko, explaining why BoJ policymakers voted to boost their stimulus programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've taken some key quotes off Reuters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuroda said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now is a critical moment for Japan to emerge from deflation. That's why we expanded QQE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's step shows our unwavering determination to end deflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Opinion emerged from the board that we should expand QQE in the process of discussing our semiannual report... The board was split with some doubting whether it was appropriate to take (additional easing) steps now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a pretty drastic step, so I think there will be a significant effect (on the economy). We don't think there is an immediate need to do anything further... but we will make necessary policy adjustments looking at upside, downside risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For now, I think we've done enough to respond to risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuroda also channelled Mario Draghi, his counterpart at the ECB, when discussing inflation expectations, saying the BoJ would do 'whatever it takes' to get the public's inflation expectations up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Japan is different from countries like the United States, which has inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent. Actual price moves have a big impact on inflation expectations. If actual price rises slow, it hurts momentum. There was a risk that despite having made steady progress, we could face a delay in eradicating the public's deflation mindset.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important for the BOJ to strongly commit to achieving its price target to get its price target firmly embedded in people's mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've pledged to do whatever it takes to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It won't do much good in trying to shake off the public's deflation mindset if you just say inflation will reach 2 percent some day. We expanded QQE to pre-empt risks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good mo rning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big news from Tokyo - the Bank of Japan has bowed to pressure and extended its stimulus programme in a renewed bid to stave off deflation, stunning the markets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BoJ policymakers agreed ( narrowly ) to buy more assets with newly created money. They will now aim to widen Japan's monetary based by 80 trillion yen per year, up from the &yen;60t-70 trillion level previously targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also buy more riskier assets, including funds traded on the stock markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BoJ acted after inflation data, released overnight, showed Japan's consumer prices index had fallen for the second year running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern was growing that Japan's bold bid to stimulate inflation and revive the economy was faltering, nearly two years after prime minister Shinzo Abe and BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda had launched radical action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the BoJ said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend and is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential. However, on the price front, somewhat weak developments in demand following the consumption tax hike and a substantial decline in crude oil prices have been exerting downward pressure recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the current downward pressure on prices remains, there is a risk that conversion of deflationary mindset, which has so far been progressing steadily, will be delayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's action is a real surprise, sending shares soaring on the Japanese stock market and weakening the yen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the BoJ was split over the decision - voting 5-4 in favour:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Maine obtained a temporary court order on Friday that places restrictions on the movements of a nurse who worked with Ebola patients in west Africa, but who has not shown any symptoms of the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court order allows Kaci Hickox to leave her home, but she may not go to public gatherings and must maintain a 3ft distance from other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a decision issued on Friday morning, chief district court judge Charles C LaVerdlere wrote that the case had &quot;critical implications for [Hickox's] freedom&quot;, and &quot;the public's right to be protected from the potential severe harm posed by transmission of a devastating disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further hearing will be held to determined the legality of the measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials had wanted to quarantine Hickox in her home until 10 November. Officials backed down after Hickox threatened legal action and hired two civil rights attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was stopped at Newark Liberty airport a week ago after she arrived from Sierra Leone, where she had been working for Doctors Without Borders caring for Ebola patients. Sierra Leone is one of the three west African countries worst affected by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary order requires Hickox to abide by a set of restrictions that largely mirror guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She must stay in Fort Kent, and if she does travel, coordinate with health officials. She will be allowed to go outside, as she did during a bike ride on an isolated road on Thursday, but she must maintain a 3ft distance from others. She may not go to work or attend public gatherings, and must report her temperature and any symptoms to public health officials daily.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight between a Maine nurse under Ebola-quarantine orders and authorities intensified on Thursday, as the nurse defied state orders and went for a bike ride with her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse, Kaci Hickox, has argued that forced 21-day isolation orders are medically unnecessary and violate her civil rights. She has hired two New York City-based attorneys to fight Maine's orders that she stay isolated indoors until 10 November. The governor of Maine said he would back down if she agreed to take a blood test, but the standoff continued on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and tried to resolve this amicably but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,&quot; said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed state troopers have been guarding Hickox's house since Wednesday, standing outside with a huddle of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine state police followed Hickox on her bike ride with boyfriend Ted Wilbur to monitor her interaction with the public. The Associated Press reports that Maine state police cannot arrest Hickox, because they have not obtained a court order to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In an interview with ABC News, Paul LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, said he would back down if Hickox took a blood test. &quot;This could be resolved today. She has been exposed [to Ebola] and she's not cooperative, so force her to take a test. It's so simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor later said negotiations between Hickox's attorneys and the state failed, and he would continue to pursue legal action. In a statement, the governor said he would allow quarantined healthcare workers to &quot;walking or jogging in a park,&quot; but would not allow them to attend public gatherings, travel or come within three feet of others. The state is likely to seek confidentiality on any paperwork it files with local courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse hired attorneys after she was questioned and detained at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey on Friday. Airport officials questioned Hickox for three hours before detecting an elevated temperature with a heat-scanning gun ( which researchers do not consider reliable ), and bringing her to a nearby hospital where she was detained. Hickox was forced to stay in an isolation tent at Newark University hospital until Monday, when the governor of New Jersey agreed to her release. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus can have an incubation period of up to 21 days before infected persons show symptoms, typically first a fever. Ebola is only contagious when those infected are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To combat the disease, with which four people have been diagnosed in the United States, several states have adopted measures over and above what is called for by federal health authorities. Maine, for example, says it will isolate any healthcare worker returning from the Ebola-stricken west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation measures have brought widespread condemnation from the medical establishment and the White House. Aid organizations say the mandatory isolation periods will make it more difficult to recruit volunteers, who typically serve in west Africa for only a few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced a program to &quot;encourage&quot; healthcare workers to go to west Africa. A press release said the program &quot;would be modeled on benefits and rights provided to military reservists,&quot; and said that returning workers would be compensated for &quot;any quarantines that are needed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, an international aid organization that responds to public health crises, commented on Hickox's isolation saying it &quot;strongly disagrees with blanket forced quarantine for healthcare workers returning from Ebola affected countries.&quot; The organization added that &quot;such a measure is not based upon established medical science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kaci Hickox has carried out important, life-saving work for [Doctors Without Borders] in a number of countries in recent years, and we are proud to have her as a member of our organization. [Doctors Without Borders] respects Kaci's right as a private citizen to challenge excessive restrictions being placed upon her,&quot; the organization said in a press release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine's top public health official has said the state will if necessary seek a court order to ensure a nurse stays quarantined in her home after returning from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurse Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for the disease on Saturday, said she would sue the state of Maine if officials did not lift a home-quarantine order and allow her to move freely by Thursday morning, arguing that such a mandate violates her personal liberties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Mayhew, the commissioner of the state department of health and human services, pleaded with Hickox to abide by the state's 21-day at-home quarantine order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to legally enforce an in-home quarantine unless absolutely necessary,&quot; Mayhew said on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayhew described the quarantine as &quot;voluntary&quot;, but said her office would seek to use the courts to keep Hickox in her home if she tried to leave. Mayhew said the process to obtain a court order had begun by Wednesday evening. One of Hickox's attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox's home &quot;for her protection and the health of the community&quot;. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said at 1pm ET on Wednesday that at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox, 33, said she is concerned that the quarantine requirements, which go beyond the recommended federal guidelines for how to monitor travellers arriving from the west Africa, were predicated on fear, not science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me. I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong, and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the restrictions placed on me by the state of Maine are not lifted by Thursday morning, I will go to court to fight for my freedom,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the governors of New York and New Jersey declared a mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea who had had contact with an Ebola sufferer. Just as the policy was introduced Hickox landed at Newark airport in New Jersey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was rushed to hospital after airport authorities detected that Hickox had a slightly elevated temperature. At the hospital, an oral thermometer recorded a more accurate temperature of 98.6F. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent with no access to a shower or television. From confinement, she published a scathing letter in the Dallas Morning News about her treatment. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, released her on Monday, and she returned to her home in Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials are asking Hickox to stay at home for the duration of her three-week isolation period, which ends on 10 November. Those infected with the Ebola virus may not develop symptoms until up to 21 days after exposure. However, people infected with Ebola are not infectious until they become symptomatic, typically after developing a fever and, even then, those infected can only spread the virus through body fluids, such as blood or vomit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York and New Jersey's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment and the White House that the orders are unnecessary, burdensome and could deter healthcare workers from volunteering in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeopaths have offered their services to prevent and treat Ebola in west Africa, claiming their &quot;remedies&quot; can work in serious epidemics of infectious disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeopaths worldwide have been mobilising their efforts toward gaining entrance in those countries affected,&quot; the National Center for Homeopathy in the US said on its website. &quot;The overriding goal is to investigate Ebola firsthand, and thereby determine which remedy or remedies are best for treating this disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation claims that homeopathic remedies have been used successfully in other disease epidemics in the past, naming cholera, diphtheria and hepatitis among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists say there is no evidence that homeopathic remedies have any effect on the body, with the substances so heavily diluted that they are effectively water. But homeopathic clinics have been set up all over Africa, sometimes offering &quot;cures&quot; for such lethal diseases as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not a jot of evidence that homeopathic treatments are effective for any infection such as Ebola,&quot; said Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor at the University of Exeter. &quot;To happily offer affected patients false hope is cruel; to pretend that homeopathy cures Ebola is irresponsible; to travel to West Africa on a 'homeopathic mission' is to disclose the insane delusions that affect many homeopaths.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, a group of young African and British doctors petitioned the World Health Organisation to speak out against homeopathy, which they believed was endangering lives. Under the auspices of the Voice of Young Science, part of the London-based Sense About Science organisation, they asked WHO to condemn the promotion of homeopathy for treating TB, infant diarrhoea, influenza, malaria and HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homeopathy does not protect people from, or treat, these diseases,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Those of us working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed. When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment, lives are lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, WHO experts, backed by the director general, stated that they did not recommend homeopathy for any of those conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently no proven treatments for Ebola, which is killing 70% of those who are infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Medics working with the most rural and impoverished people of the world already struggle to deliver the medical help that is needed,&quot; said Victoria Murphy, programme manager of Sense About Science. &quot;The promotion of homeopathy as effective or cheaper makes this difficult task even harder. It puts lives at risk, undermines conventional medicine and spreads misinformation. When homeopathy stands in place of effective treatment, lives are lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the homeopathy clinics brought to the WHO's attention in 2009 was the Amma Resonance Healing Foundation in Ethiopia, which offered homeopathy as &quot;an ideal alternative and complement for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries&quot;. The foundation, established in the Netherlands, is run by the British homeopath Peter Chappell. He and his colleague Harry van der Zee claim their homeopathic remedy can reverse Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On their website, Van der Zee now urges supporters of homeopathy to sign the Change.org petition started in Australia, calling on WHO &quot;to test and distribute homeopathy as quickly as possible to contain the outbreaks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the signatories is Steffan Browning, a Green Party MP in New Zealand. He was publicly dismissed by the prime minister John Key as &quot;barking mad&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's be honest, this is a serious global issue, and if he really thinks that's the answer I'd love to see the medical research,&quot; said Key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Browning admitted &quot;it was probably a bit unwise&quot; to sign the petition, which he also shared on his Facebook page encouraging other people to sign it. He said he had signed it &quot;pretty late at night&quot;, although he hoped WHO would keep an open mind on potential treatment options, since there was currently no cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Zealand's health minister, Jonathan Coleman, however, said treating Ebola patients with homeopathic remedies was &quot;a wacko idea&quot;, adding: &quot;I don't know what he's thinking, it's very, very dangerous. I think he really needs to engage his brain, it's a really and stupid dangerous idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight between a Maine nurse under Ebola-quarantine orders and authorities intensified on Thursday, as the nurse defied state orders and went for a bike ride with her boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse, Kaci Hickox, has argued that forced 21-day isolation orders are medically unnecessary and violate her civil rights. She has hired two New York City-based attorneys to fight Maine's orders that she stay isolated indoors until 10 November. The governor of Maine said he would back down if she agreed to take a blood test, but the standoff continued on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been in negotiations all day with the state of Maine, and tried to resolve this amicably but they will not allow me to leave my house and have any interaction with the public even though I am completely healthy and symptom-free,&quot; said Hickox from her front porch in Fort Kent, at a press conference on Wednesday evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed state troopers have been guarding Hickox's house since Wednesday, standing outside with a huddle of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine state police followed Hickox on her bike ride with boyfriend Ted Wilbur to monitor her interaction with the public. The Associated Press reports that Maine state police cannot arrest Hickox, because they have not obtained a court order to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     In an interview with ABC News, Paul LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, said he would back down if Hickox took a blood test. &quot;This could be resolved today. She has been exposed [to Ebola] and she's not cooperative, so force her to take a test. It's so simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse hired attorneys after she was questioned and detained at Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey on Friday. Airport officials questioned Hickox for three hours before detecting an elevated temperature with a heat-scanning gun ( which researchers do not consider reliable ), and bringing her to a nearby hospital where she was detained. Hickox was forced to stay in an isolation tent at Newark University hospital until Monday, when the governor of New Jersey agreed to her release. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus can have an incubation period of up to 21 days before infected persons show symptoms, typically first a fever. Ebola is only contagious when those infected are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To combat the disease, with which four people have been diagnosed in the United States, several states have adopted measures over and above what is called for by federal health authorities. Maine, for example, says it will isolate any healthcare worker returning from the Ebola-stricken west African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The isolation measures have brought widespread condemnation from the medical establishment and the White House. Aid organizations say the mandatory isolation periods will make it more difficult to recruit volunteers, who typically serve in west Africa for only a few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced a program to &quot;encourage&quot; healthcare workers to go to west Africa. A press release said the program &quot;would be modeled on benefits and rights provided to military reservists,&quot; and said that returning workers would be compensated for &quot;any quarantines that are needed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, an international aid organization that responds to public health crises, commented on Hickox's isolation saying it &quot;strongly disagrees with blanket forced quarantine for healthcare workers returning from Ebola affected countries.&quot; The organization added that &quot;such a measure is not based upon established medical science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kaci Hickox has carried out important, life-saving work for [Doctors Without Borders] in a number of countries in recent years, and we are proud to have her as a member of our organization. [Doctors Without Borders] respects Kaci's right as a private citizen to challenge excessive restrictions being placed upon her,&quot; the organization said in a press release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food Programme (WFP) is facing an unprecedented challenge in Guinea as it struggles to halt the spread of the Ebola, feed more than 350,000 people and protect the progress made in tackling chronic child malnutrition over recent years, a senior official has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elisabeth Faure, WFP's Guinea director, said the scale of the epidemic was forcing the organisation to operate far beyond its core emergency mission of getting $25m (&pound;15.5m) of food to at least 353,000 people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as distributing the food, she said, the programme was now being called on to help build Ebola treatment centres, move aid workers around the country and provide emergency communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're transporting medical equipment into remote areas, we're helping with procuring personal protective equipment kits and gloves and we're also moving humanitarian personnel with our humanitarian air service, which is a 19-seater aircraft,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very deep engagement that goes well beyond our mandate, frankly. This is a huge operation and what's really different is building treatment centres. The WFP builds other things, like huge warehouses, and does road rehabilitation in order to get food from A to B ... But the new thing is building treatment centres.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faure said that WFP engineers, working with colleagues from the World Health Organisation and blueprints from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res were building four Ebola treatment centres, each with a 100-bed capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the scale of the logistics and emergency telecoms that is new,&quot; she said. &quot;This is quite unprecedented. It's considered a level-three emergency by the organisation - which is the highest emergency - but in fact a lot of people are saying it is about a level-five: it's much bigger than we're used to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP, she added, urgently need more money to help it cope with the emergency: despite appealing for $120m for the regional food response, it has received only about $51m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The west African Ebola outbreak has so far claimed 4,922 lives, the vast majority in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite reports that the number of cases in Liberia has begun to fall, Faure said things in Guinea were going in the opposite direction, with the &quot;robust epidemic&quot; showing no sign of subsiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen several waves, with the number of cases increasing and then declining and increasing and declining again,&quot; she said. &quot;But we're now in a kind of third peak - by far the highest peak - with the highest number of cases since the epidemic started in Guinea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faure said the wave pattern underlined the need to guard against complacency, adding that the disease was now starting to appear in previously unaffected areas of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally worrying, she said, was the effect it was having on people's ability to feed their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The spread of Ebola has affected food trade and markets and also caused wages to go down in Guinea,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent WFP survey carried out by text message showed that people were beginning to eat less or reduce the number of meals they have each day to make their money go further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's worrying, because we're no longer in the lean season, where there are food shortages,&quot; she said. &quot;Guinea was a very food insecure country to begin with and, at this time of year, things should be beginning to improve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The longer Ebola continued to spread in Guinea, said Faure, the greater the threat to existing programmes to fight the country's levels of chronic child malnutrition, which stood at 40% in some areas even before the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the health centres are closed and many of the health workers aren't working any more, so all the programmes to treat malnutrition are likely to be affected,&quot; she said. &quot;That's why we need to work not only on the emergency response, but also on the longer-term by restarting or expanding the nutrition programmes we have in the country. Otherwise, we're going to see development basically being lost and all the progress that's been made being reversed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank is to invest $100m (&pound;63m) in an attempt to increase the number of foreign health workers heading for west Africa to care for people with Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treatment centres in the three countries at the heart of the epidemic - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - are being built but the biggest need is for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers to staff them. The United Nations says around 5,000 international personnel are needed, including up to 1,000 foreign health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the UK 900 people have volunteered to go to Africa, none of whom have left yet, while the African Union has pledged 2,000 people. More numbers are needed and progress in getting volunteers to affected areas has been slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world's response to the Ebola crisis has increased significantly in recent weeks, but we still have a huge gap in getting enough trained health workers to the areas with the highest infection rates,&quot; said the World Bank Group president, Jim Yong Kim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must urgently find ways to break any barriers to the deployment of more health workers. It is our hope that this $100m can help be a catalyst for a rapid surge of health workers to the communities in dire need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pay and benefits, recruitment and training have all been issues, says the Bank. Potential volunteers are also worried about their safety - health workers are at the highest risk of contracting the disease because of their physical contact with sick patients. There have been major scares in the United States and in Spain where health workers have been infected even though they should have been well-equipped and trained in the strict safety procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers from Europe and north America also want to be sure they will be repatriated in the event of becoming ill, believing their chances of survival to be greater at home, where health systems are more sophisticated because they are better funded. The UK is building a treatment centre specifically for health workers who become infected in Sierra Leone, where standards are intended to be as high as they would be in the NHS. Other concerns include transportation and housing, says the Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new funds, which take the World Bank's total Ebola contribution so far to $500m, will help set up a coordination hub with the three countries' governments, the World Health Organisation, the UN's main Ebola coordination centre in Ghana and other agencies. The hub will actively recruit, train and deploy qualified health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Health workers take an oath to treat the sick - and so it's no surprise to me that many health workers want to go to treat Ebola patients at the source of this epidemic,&quot; said Kim, an infectious disease doctor who spent years treating patients in poor countries. &quot;So we need to find all ways possible to remove any obstacle that stops health workers from serving - whether it is pay for workers in developing countries, or the promise of evacuation services. Health workers who treat Ebola patients are heroes, and we should treat them as such.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">981 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the war refugees who have escaped ransacked South Sudanese towns and impoverished villages, and for the aid workers assisting them in the western Ethiopian region of Gambella, now is a time for waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ban, 26, has been stuck in a camp on the Ethiopian border during the rainy season, sleeping in a large communal tent with her four children. They've got no mosquito nets or sheets, and she's not happy with the grain distributed by the UN as it causes diarrhoea. But because the Tierkedi and Kule camps are full, and Leitchuor camp flooded, she will have to remain in Pagak for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am waiting to be relocated,&quot; she says, pausing from bundling firewood to sell. &quot;We will be here until we [are] taken to the place we need.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncertainty in the refugee operation is twofold. Though a difficult situation is under control for now, many believe heavy fighting will resume in South Sudan once roads dry up, leading to a new surge of tens of thousands of refugees. Moreover, Ethiopia's government is struggling to find suitable locations for flooded refugees and potential new arrivals that do not disturb volatile local political dynamics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban, an ethnic Nuer from Mathiang in Upper Nile state, has been offered space at a camp along with 3,000 other people at Pagak. Only 12 accepted. That is because the camp is more than 250 miles away, in the south of Gambella - far from the Nuer strongholds in the region and close to their ethnic rivals, the Dinka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be in Kule, but we don't want another area. We don't like Dima, as it's near to the Dinka side. Dinka came to Mathiang and killed a lot of people; children, women and old people,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban is one of almost 200,000 primarily Nuer refugees who have ended up in Ethiopia since December 2013, when attempts by Kiir to arrest political rivals for coup plotting - including his Nuer former deputy, Riek Machar - prompted commanders to rebel. The ensuing clashes have claimed thousands of lives and displaced nearly 2 million people (pdf).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ceasefire deals have been signed in Addis Ababa, but in reality it is the rainy season that has discouraged the movement of potential refugees and armed groups. The result has been a huge reduction in people crossing the border, despite severe food shortages inside South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid organisations nonetheless remain alert: fading rains could lead to renewed fighting, causing a surge comparable to the first few months of the crisis, when thousands a day were arriving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why humanitarian agencies are working with a 100,000-extra influx in the latest months of the year,&quot; explains Dennis Solberg Kjeldsen, regional operations coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. &quot;So right now there's a little bit of a lull ... but we're quite sure we're going to need the resources, we're going to need funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funds are in heavy demand because of the exceptional number of emergencies occurring globally, not least the Ebola outbreak. &quot;I don't want to underestimate or downplay the threat of Ebola, but Ebola has taken an enormous amount of attention away from ongoing emergencies on the continent,&quot; he said. The UN refugee agency has received 37% of the requested $567m (&pound;355m) needed to deal with the 2 million displaced inside and outside South Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are also waiting for Ethiopia's federal and regional governments to settle on an alternative to the existing Okugu camp near Dima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the refugees' fears regarding the Dinka, there are tensions in Gambella (pdf) between the Nuer and the Anuak people, another Nilotic ethnicity, which complicate the decision. Although Gambella is one of Ethiopia's most sparsely populated areas, access to its plentiful land and water is contested. Because of its fertility, the federal government has earmarked the state for commercial agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anuak, who consider themselves the original inhabitants of the area, feel encroached upon by the now more populous Nuer, and also threatened by foreign and highland farming investors. This year's influx of Nuer - equal to 60% of Gambella's 2007 official population of 307,000 - is only the latest instalment in a century-old trend. The rate of arrival has increased in the five decades since the southern Sudanese began their struggle against Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anuak discontent manifests itself in sporadic violent clashes, most recently with highlanders. In 2012, Anuak rebels killed workers at a prominent rice farm, leading to reprisals by security forces. A scuffle between schoolchildren this month led to a series of tit-for-tat killings and mob violence between Anuak and highland communities in Abobo and Gambella towns, according to Anuak elders and local security sources. The scars of a 2003 bout of violence - when, according to Human Rights Watch, soldiers and militias targeted Anuak civilians after acts of banditry - have barely healed. Anuak people fear a repeat of what some call a massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also resentment at the arrivals from the west. One of the Anuak elders, Ochodo Obang, sees all Nuer settlers as foreign colonisers. &quot;These people are like the highlanders; they want to take our land. We are the owners of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want them to be here at all. It's not a question of do we put them here or there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for officials is how to accommodate tens (and possibly hundreds) of thousands more Nuer in the next few months without stoking disputes. The dry and stable Kule and Tierkedi camps that house about 100,000 people are in former Anuak areas, Ochodo says. The ill-fated government decision to choose Leitchuor camp - located in a floodplain, it is now largely submerged - resulted from a lack of good options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of difficult issues around it, not least the ethnic dimensions,&quot; said Kjeldsen of the government's choice. &quot;We have to be careful we don't exacerbate any tension.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has refused an order by the Senate to reveal the reasons behind its ban on accepting refugees from Ebola-stricken Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, saying to disclose its advice would risk national security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday the immigration minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia's humanitarian visa program for refugees from Ebola-affected west African countries would be suspended - including processing applications - until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later the Senate ordered the government to table the advice it had relied on in making that decision, but on Thursday the assistant minister for immigration and border protection, Michaelia Cash, told the Senate the advice could not be revealed because it would &quot;cause damage to national security&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The significant threat of Ebola continues in west Africa and whilst the level of preparedness in our country is very high, we are continually assessing our response and limiting risk wherever possible ... the government does not believe it is in the public interest to release the documents,&quot; Cash said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called for the refugee ban to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lack of compassion and cruelty on display in this move has shocked the international community. Australia is being held up to ridicule because of the minister's heartless approach to people in need,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Queensland premier, Campbell Newman, has written to Morrison asking him to order blanket screening by customs and quarantine officers for Ebola symptoms for all arrivals from affected west African countries. The Queensland health department would supply the thermometers and, in return, Newman would want passenger details to be shared with the state's quarantine office and public health officials, who would then consider further tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nineteen people from four west-African families are in home isolation in Queensland. They arrived in the state on humanitarian visas earlier this month, and one, an 18-year-old woman, was temporarily hospitalised with a fever but tested negative to Ebola on Monday. The group has another four days in quarantine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Mayhew, the commissioner of the state department of health and human services, pleaded with Hickox to abide by the state's 21-day at-home quarantine order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want to legally enforce an in-home quarantine unless absolutely necessary,&quot; Mayhew said on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayhew described the quarantine as &quot;voluntary&quot;, but said her office would seek to use the courts to keep Hickox in her home if she tried to leave. Mayhew said the process to obtain a court order had begun by Wednesday evening. One of Hickox's attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox's home &quot;for her protection and the health of the community&quot;. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said at 1pm ET on Wednesday that at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox, 33, said she is concerned that the quarantine requirements, which go beyond the recommended federal guidelines for how to monitor travellers arriving from the west Africa, were predicated on fear, not science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me. I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong, and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the restrictions placed on me by the state of Maine are not lifted by Thursday morning, I will go to court to fight for my freedom,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the governors of New York and New Jersey declared a mandatory quarantine for anyone arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea who had had contact with an Ebola sufferer. Just as the policy was introduced Hickox landed at Newark airport in New Jersey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was rushed to hospital after airport authorities detected that Hickox had a slightly elevated temperature. At the hospital, an oral thermometer recorded a more accurate temperature of 98.6F. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent with no access to a shower or television. From confinement, she published a scathing letter in the Dallas Morning News about her treatment. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, released her on Monday, and she returned to her home in Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine officials are asking Hickox to stay at home for the duration of her three-week isolation period, which ends on 10 November. Those infected with the Ebola virus may not develop symptoms until up to 21 days after exposure. However, people infected with Ebola are not infectious until they become symptomatic, typically after developing a fever and, even then, those infected can only spread the virus through body fluids, such as blood or vomit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York and New Jersey's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment and the White House that the orders are unnecessary, burdensome and could deter healthcare workers from volunteering in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep in mind that if we're discouraging our healthcare workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from traveling to these places in need, then we're not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,&quot; President Barack Obama said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE second of two US nurses infected with Ebola has been released from hospital in what President Barack Obama hailed as a sign that the virus can be contained and &quot;will be defeated&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AmberVinson caught the disease while treating a Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, in a Texas hospital and her infection caused fears of an imminent Ebola outbreak in the US. She and another nurse, Nina Pham, were successfully treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm so grateful to be well,&quot; Ms Vinson, 29, said at Emory University Hospital in Georgia. &quot;God's love has truly carried me and my family through this difficult time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama spoke to Ms Vinson shortly before she was discharged and told reporters that she was &quot;doing well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president used the successful treatment as an opportunity to reassure an American public rattled by the US government's shaky initial response to the virus. &quot;Of the seven Americans treated for Ebola so far, all have survived,&quot; Mr Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Craig Spencer, a New York doctor who contracted the disease while treating Ebola patients in Guinea, West Africa, is now the only American known to have the disease. He is in a serious but stable condition at a Manhattan hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This disease can be contained,&quot; Mr Obama said. &quot;It will be defeated. Progress is possible, but we're going to have to stay vigilant and we've got to make sure that we're working together.&quot; The president also took a veiled shot at the governors of New York, New Jersey and Illinois, who have imposed 21-day quarantines on health workers returning from West Africa, despite the White House's insistence that such practice is unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The states insist that such measures are needed to prevent any spread of the virus, but the White House and public health experts have warned it will discourage volunteers from going abroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse freed from an Ebola isolation tent in a New Jersey hospital declared on Wednesday the she will not comply with a quarantine request imposed by state officials, saying the policy is not based on science and infringes on her civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; nurse Kaci Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me, even though I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's office said in a statement that Maine state police would monitor Kickox's home &quot;for both her protection and the health of the community&quot;. A TV reporter with the local WLBZ news channel said as of 1pm ET on Wednesday at least two police cars were parked out front of the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox said she would sue the state of Maine if officials did not lift home-quarantine orders by Thursday morning. One of her attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have absolutely no justification to quarantine Kaci, and if necessary we will fight to obtain her freedom,&quot; said Siegel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Hickox was questioned for hours in Newark airport on Friday, after returning from a stint with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone. She was taken to Newark University hospital on Friday and placed in an isolation tent after airport authorities detected that Hickox had an elevated temperature using a thermal scan gun. She was released on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Several states, including Maine, maintain they will enforce strict quarantine standards for returning healthcare workers despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine's quarantine rules are voluntary, although the state's health commissioner, Mary Mayhew, said on Tuesday it would &quot;take additional measures and pursue appropriate authority&quot; if healthcare workers declined to comply with it. The state could seek a court order to compel healthcare workers exposed to Ebola in west Africa to stay in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, believes such orders could deter volunteer sign-up for trips to help with the Ebola crisis in west Africa. The aid organisation argues that because tours typically range from four to six weeks, and an additional three-week quarantine is a significant burden on healthcare volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publications such as the New England Journal of Medicine have also jumped into the fray, saying that such orders are &quot;like driving a carpet tack with a sledgehammer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approach &quot;is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal&quot;, the editorial said of the 21-day isolation requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People infected with the Ebola virus may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, spurring the calls by politicians for a three-week isolation period. However, people with the disease are not infectious until they are symptomatic, typically after developing a fever. Even then, those infected can only spread Ebola through body fluids, such as blood or vomit. The disease is not airborne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before Hickox was detained in Newark airport, a New York City doctor, Craig Spencer, was diagnosed with Ebola. The doctor took at least three trips on the subway, dined out and went bowling, spurring public anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you understand what that did to the psyche of public officials in a metropolis of nine million people,&quot; the Today show host Matt Lauer asked Hickox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course I do understand, it has created a lot of fear, but we still have to make policies based on evidence,&quot; Hickox said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US military personnel returning from anti-Ebola efforts in west Africa will be subject to a stricter quarantine than recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Pentagon announced on Wednesday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, has approved a plan from US military commanders for a &quot;controlled monitoring regimen&quot; lasting 21 days for troops deployed to Liberia and Senegal to help contain the outbreak. Over 3,900 service members are expected to join that effort, currently totalling 700, in the coming weeks. None of them come in direct contact with Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen US soldiers led by Major General Darryl Williams, who represented the initial complement of US troops sent to west Africa, are currently quarantined at a base in Vicenza, Italy. Hagel's decision expands the prospective quarantine to troops across all military branches who take part in the anti-Ebola mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new military quarantine rules place US service members under tighter monitoring conditions than the CDC consider prudent. This week, the CDC issued guidelines instructing only &quot;high-risk&quot; individuals, such as those who are exposed to Ebola-infected body fluids, to quarantine at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US personnel serving in what the military calls Operation United Assistance would not be classified as &quot;high-risk&quot; under the CDC's new Ebola guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel instructed the heads of the military services to prepare specific implementation plans for a quarantine within 15 days. The Pentagon said Hagel would review the quarantine after 45 days and decide then if continuing the quarantines are appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, characterized what he called Hagel's &quot;initial steps&quot; as &quot;prudent given the large number of military personnel transiting from their home base and west Africa and the unique logistical demands and impact this deployment has on the force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep Buck McKeon, the California Republican who chairs the House armed services committee, cautiously praised the quarantine as &quot;the right call&quot; for the time being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope DoD can find a way to balance the concerns about health and safety while minimizing the burden on overtaxed troops on what could be a long deployment, but their safety and well being must be paramount,&quot; McKeon said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third potential Ebola vaccine could be tested on healthworkers in west Africa in December following the announcement of funding to speed it through its first-ever human safety trials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccine, called rVSV-EBOV, was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. So far it has been tested only in monkeys, but in the hope that it could prove effective, 800 vials have been donated by the Canadian government. The safety trials - in which people at no risk of catching Ebola are vaccinated to ensure there are no serious side-effects - will start imminently in Germany, Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wellcome Trust is donating &pound;3.1m to enable the collection of safety data, overseen by the World Health Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several crucial pieces of the jigsaw are falling into place in terms of the global leadership and action required to turn this epidemic around,&quot; said Prof Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. &quot;Communities in west Africa continue to suffer from the crisis with remarkable fortitude and finally the rich world has committed significant finance and resources to support critical public health measures, and progress in the search for treatments is encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, accelerated vaccine development is being properly prioritised too, so we have the best possible chance of a safe and effective vaccine in time to transform our prospects of containing Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wellcome Trust's experts describe the VSV vaccine candidate as one of the most promising. There are two others that are more advanced in clinical trials - one made by the British pharmaceuticals company GlaxoSmithKline and the other by Johnson &amp; Johnson in the US. Both will move into trials in west Africa, probably in health workers and burial teams, in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian vaccine uses a weakened form of live vesicular stomatitis virus, a pathogen found in livestock that has been used in other vaccines and elicits a strong response from the body's immune system. It will have been modified so that the gene for the outer protein of VSV is replaced with a segment of the gene for the outer protein of the Zaire Ebola virus species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is expected to produce a good immune response against the Ebola virus, there are questions over the possible side-effects, which could include fever - one of the earliest symptoms of Ebola and also malaria.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse freed from an Ebola isolation tent in a New Jersey hospital declared on Wednesday the she will not comply with a quarantine request imposed by state officials, saying the policy is not based on science and infringes on her civil liberties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't plan on sticking to the guidelines,&quot; nurse Kaci Hickox told the Today show from her home in Maine. &quot;I remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me, even though I am in perfectly good health and feeling strong and have been this entire time completely symptom-free.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox said she would sue the state of Maine if officials did not lift home-quarantine orders by Thursday morning. One of her attorneys, New York City-based Norman Siegel, told the Today show that they would wait for Maine authorities to physically apprehend her before taking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have absolutely no justification to quarantine Kaci, and if necessary we will fight to obtain her freedom,&quot; said Siegel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Hickox was questioned for hours in Newark airport on Friday, after returning from a stint with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone. She was taken to Newark University hospital on Friday and placed in an isolation tent after airport authorities detected that Hickox had an elevated temperature using a thermal scan gun. She was released on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Several states, including Maine, maintain they will enforce strict quarantine standards for returning healthcare workers despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine's quarantine rules are voluntary, although the state's health commissioner, Mary Mayhew, said on Tuesday it would &quot;take additional measures and pursue appropriate authority&quot; if healthcare workers declined to comply with it. The state could seek a court order to compel healthcare workers exposed to Ebola in west Africa to stay in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, believes such orders could deter volunteer sign-up for trips to help with the Ebola crisis in west Africa. The aid organisation argues that because tours typically range from four to six weeks, and an additional three-week quarantine is a significant burden on healthcare volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publications such as the New England Journal of Medicine have also jumped into the fray, saying that such orders are &quot;like driving a carpet tack with a sledgehammer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approach &quot;is not scientifically based, is unfair and unwise, and will impede essential efforts to stop these awful outbreaks of Ebola disease at their source, which is the only satisfactory goal&quot;, the editorial said of the 21-day isolation requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People infected with the Ebola virus may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, spurring the calls by politicians for a three-week isolation period. However, people with the disease are not infectious until they are symptomatic, typically after developing a fever. Even then, those infected can only spread Ebola through body fluids, such as blood or vomit. The disease is not airborne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before Hickox was detained in Newark airport, a New York City doctor, Craig Spencer, was diagnosed with Ebola. The doctor took at least three trips on the subway, dined out and went bowling, spurring public anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you understand what that did to the psyche of public officials in a metropolis of nine million people,&quot; the Today show host Matt Lauer asked Hickox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course I do understand, it has created a lot of fear, but we still have to make policies based on evidence,&quot; Hickox said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Africa, now in the throes of a calamitous Ebola epidemic, missed out on significant health investment over the past decade or more because it had low rates of HIV, a detailed survey of the changing health of Africa and Asia reveals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major project called Indepth, which has looked at the causes of death of more than 110,000 people in 13 countries shows that health improved generally in those given substantial international aid to try to turn around the HIV and Aids epidemic. But west Africa, with severe poverty and low healthcare standards but relatively little HIV, did not benefit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most parts of Africa, health systems have been strengthened by the external funding of HIV,&quot; said Dr Jimmy Whitworth, head of population health at the Wellcome Trust which funded the project. Pepfar (the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief) and other agencies invested in health clinics and staff in order to make it possible for thousands of Africans in Aids and HIV-hit countries such as Kenya to be tested and given antiretroviral drugs to keep them alive and well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a view at one stage that HIV care would crowd out other illnesses and they would get worse,&quot; said Whitworth - but that did not happen. Instead, healthcare became a higher political priority in countries such as Rwanda and Kenya and improved across the board over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no such improvement occurred in Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea. &quot;In west Africa it is most stark,&quot; said Whitworth. &quot;I used to work in Sierra Leone in the late 80s. The health services were pretty poor at that time. Since then, they have gone through civil war with everything collapsing. They have been rebuilding since the civil war ended so some improvement has been made, but I don't think the health systems have been strengthened very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Aids focused minds and money 15 years ago, so Ebola should now. Whitworth said he hoped that as healthcare in west Africa now had the world's attention, it could keep it. &quot;Otherwise we're left as a global community with a real achilles heel with inadequate services,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indepth project is an unprecedented exploration of the causes of death in communities where no records are kept. Hundreds of researchers carried out interviews over two decades to establish how people died. They conducted verbal autopsies, interviewing family members in a structured way about the illness and last days of the deceased. The data, collected in 22 sites, each containing around 100,000 people, were then computer processed to establish the likely cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most studies that publish death rates from diseases around the world use official figures from hospitals, but deaths in rural villages are missed and there are no death certificates issued in rural Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data comes to similar conclusions to the Global Burden of Disease study on the toll taken by malaria, TB, HIV and maternal and child mortality. But it shows a great deal of variability between one region and another - and investment in healthcare appears to be a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deaths of women in pregnancy and labour and child deaths are consistently high across Africa and Asia. Children's drownings in Bangladesh and homicide among adult men in eastern and southern Africa are also causes for concern, the authors say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data is being published in a special issue of the journal Global Health Action, which is open access.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NURSE who threatened to sue after being forced into quarantine when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Africa has been allowed to go home, amid growing confusion among US offi-cials over the best way to handle such cases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an apparent reversal, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, agreed to let Kaci Hickox leave the hospital isolation ward where she has been held since Friday, despite testing negative for the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He insisted that a quarantine order for all medical staff returning from treating Ebola victims in West Africa should remain in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Hickox was due to be taken to her home in Maine, where a rigid quarantine order has not been imposed and where travellers from the three nations at the centre of the Ebola epidemic - Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia - must monitor themselves for signs of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Texas-trained nurse was put in quarantine after flying into New Jersey's Newark airport on her way back from Sierra Leone, where she had cared for children dying from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her arrival coincided with the imposition of the strict quarantine measures in New Jersey and neighbouring New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were introduced in response to the case of a doctor who tested positive for the disease five days after returning to his home in Manhattan from treating Ebola victims in Guinea. Dr Craig Spencer remains in a serious but stable condition at New York's Bellevue hospital. Miss Hickox claimed her human rights had been abused and that she was being treated like a &quot;criminal&quot;. On Sunday she hired a leading human rights lawyer to challenge the quarantine order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid a growing outcry over her treatment, with critics suggesting the strict quarantine was counterproductive, New York loosened its quarantine measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Christie stood by the measures, which remain in place in New Jersey, and said Miss Hickox was only being released because she had been symptom-free for 24 hours after testing negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tests were also carried out on a fiveyear-old boy in New York who developed symptoms consistent with Ebola soon after returning from Guinea. However, he was later cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A dozen American soldiers returning from working in West Africa have been placed in isolation for up to 21 days at a US military base in Italy, as a precaution to prevent the potential spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, the army directed a small number of personnel, about a dozen, that recently returned to Italy, to be monitored in a separate location at their home station of Vicenza,&quot; said Col Steven Warren, a spokesman for the Pentagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Centres for Disease Control published new guidance for travellers, requiring health workers who had been in Ebola regions to stay away from public areas for 21 days after their return. Other travellers are told to report any suspect symptoms to the authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak has placed the US secretary of defense on the horns of a dilemma: whether to back the military service chiefs about a quarantine for troops or to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommends no such thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense chief Chuck Hagel has received a recommendation for a &quot;quarantine-like program&quot; for all US servicemembers returning from Liberia and Senegal, where they are supporting civilian efforts to contain the disease, Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said on Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recommendation, made by the heads of the military services, would expand across the military a directive made on Monday from the army chief, General Raymond Odierno, to keep soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance in Liberia and Senegal under a 21-day period of &quot;controlled monitoring&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirby said Hagel has yet to make a decision, having received the quarantine recommendation earlier on Tuesday. But imposing a broader military quarantine for returning servicemembers goes beyond new guidance set on Monday by the CDC, which urged a home quarantine only for high-risk individuals, such as those whose body fluids have been directly exposed to Ebola. US troops have not been involved in treating Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, Hagel's choice involves rebuking either scientists who seek to control a potential outbreak without provoking fear or rebuking the military leadership on an issue of troop safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military has sent 700 servicemembers into west Africa, mostly in Liberia, to build field medical facilities, set up staging areas for inserting and distributing supplies, and support the US Agency for International Development. The Pentagon said on Saturday that &quot;upwards of 3,900 personnel&quot; will be deployed to west Africa in the coming weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army Major General Darryl Williams, who led the initial military mission, has now been placed in quarantine with the dozen soldiers returning with him from Africa. They are to remain at an army base in Vicenza, Italy, for the next 21 days, away from their families, before returning to the United States. None are said to display symptoms of the disease, though the soldiers have their temperatures taken twice daily and their plastic utensils burned after mealtime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The morale is high and very comfortable with the contribution we made,&quot; Williams told CNN on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirby said the service chiefs' recommendations for the quarantine emerged from an &quot;abundance of caution&quot; and denied that there was any additional danger of exposure the military faces as it aids the anti-Ebola effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soldiers currently undergoing the &quot;quarantine-like&quot; program are permitted access to recreation, including television and exercise, and are &quot;subsisting quite well&quot;, Kirby said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel's decision comes amid a political contretemps after the Democratic governor of New York and the Republican governor of New Jersey imposed quarantines, only to scale them back once they attracted criticism. Ebola nurse Kaci Hickox was placed under quarantine in Newark upon her return from Sierra Lione despite showing no symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama on Tuesday noted that US troops do not handle Ebola patients themselves, and he is skeptical of broader quarantines at home. But Obama seemed to defend a stricter confinement for them than for civilian healthcare volunteers confronting the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians,&quot; said Obama. &quot;We don't want to do things that aren't based on science and best practices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quarantining healthcare workers who have treated Ebola patients in west Africa won't stop the disease from coming to the United States - only halting the viral outbreak abroad can do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was President Barack Obama's message on Tuesday, after governors in several states enacted strict quarantine orders for healthcare workers, and after New Jersey released a Maine nurse who was held against her will for three days, 600 miles from home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to discourage our health care workers from going to the front lines and dealing with this in an effective way,&quot; said Obama. &quot;If we don't have robust international response in west Africa, then we are actually endangering ourselves here back home.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate event on Tuesday, a nurse released from an Ebola quarantine tent in a New Jersey hospital was making her 600-mile journey home to Maine. But how much freedom Kaci Hickox will have in the final two weeks of her quarantine period remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Maine's state guidelines, healthcare workers returning from one of the three west African countries worst affected by the Ebola outbreak must be quarantined for 21 days in their homes. Hickox is the first to be subject to such a measure. The state has not said whether the quarantine is voluntary, or how it might be enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We certainly understand healthcare workers' desire to get home after doing good work in west Africa,&quot; said the Maine governor, Paul LePage. &quot;But we must be vigilant in our duty to protect the health and safety of all Mainers, as well as anyone who may come in contact with someone who has been exposed to Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone returning to Maine from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone will undergo daily monitoring. Effectively, that means people returning from the countries will be called by the Maine health department daily. Returning healthcare workers will have to check their temperature twice a day, receive daily calls and remain in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those infected with Ebola show symptoms within 21 days, and only when symptomatic are patients contagious. The disease is spread through body fluids, such as vomit or blood. Many believe mandatory quarantine measures could remand healthy, asymptomatic workers to their homes when they are at no risk of infecting others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Public health [policies] are not arbitrary. They're built on what we know about the virus and how it's transmitted,&quot; said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University school of medicine. &quot;I, at least, find no real scientific reason to oblige people who've come back from west Africa to be quarantined in their home, to have their movements curtailed, to have their civil liberties curtailed, if they have no real symptoms and if they're in a monitoring programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State guidelines have evolved quickly over the last week. New quarantine measures have been variously announced by both politicians and health departments. While new policies look to curb anxiety, not all are entirely transparent or based on science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance on Monday, recommending six states undertake active monitoring programmes. Effectively, this means health departments call returning travellers once a day, and require those in direct contact with Ebola patients report their temperatures. Those six states - New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia - receive about 70% of travelers from Ebola affected areas in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some states do not believe the CDC's guidelines are enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was quarantined in an in-hospital tent in the confusion following New Jersey's policy change. Hickox flew into Newark airport on Friday following volunteer work in Sierra Leone. The nurse was questioned and held at the airport in Newark for almost seven hours before being placed into mandatory quarantine in the city's University hospital. Though Hickox was released, it is unclear whether the policy has officially changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox is suing on the grounds that the mandatory quarantine violated her civil rights and was scientifically unfounded. While she was allowed to leave the hospital, the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, maintains he has not changed the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandatory quarantine measures have exposed two conflicting needs: to counter public concern, and the need to recruit volunteer healthcare workers to the fight against Ebola in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are other ways to adequately address both public anxiety and health imperatives,&quot; said Sophie Delaunay, executive director of Doctors Without Borders in a statement on Monday. She said that adding a three-week quarantine period to normal tours of between four and six weeks could severely hamper recruitment efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The response to Ebola must not be guided primarily by panic in countries not overly affected by the epidemic,&quot; Delaunay said. &quot;Any regulation not based on scientific medical grounds, which would isolate healthy aid workers, will very likely serve as a disincentive to others to combat the epidemic at its source, in west Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the country, public health experts have attempted to assuage public concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way we will truly be able to keep our citizens safe is to control the outbreak in west Africa,&quot; said Dr Bruce Ribner, an infectious disease expert at Emory university hospital, during a press conference, Tuesday. The hospital successfully treated Amber Vinson, a Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola when she treated Thomas Duncan, the first patient to be diagnosed with the virus in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be very mindful of any undetected consequences which may make it more difficult to manage patients in the African continent,&quot; said Ribner. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse released from an Ebola quarantine tent in a New Jersey hospital was making her 600-mile journey home to Maine on Tuesday, but how much freedom Kaci Hickox will have in the final two weeks of her quarantine period remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Maine's state guidelines, healthcare workers returning from one of the three west African countries worst affected by the Ebola outbreak must be quarantined for 21 days in their homes. Hickox is the first to be subject to such a measure. The state has not said whether the quarantine is voluntary, or how it might be enforced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We certainly understand healthcare workers' desire to get home after doing good work in west Africa,&quot; said Maine governor Paul LePage. &quot;But we must be vigilant in our duty to protect the health and safety of all Mainers, as well as anyone who may come in contact with someone who has been exposed to Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone returning to Maine from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone will undergo daily monitoring. Effectively, that means people returning from the countries will be called by the Maine health department daily. Returning healthcare workers will have to check their temperature twice a day, receive daily calls and remain in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those infected with Ebola show symptoms within 21 days, and only when symptomatic are patients contagious. The disease is spread through body fluids, such as vomit or blood. Many believe mandatory quarantine measures could remand healthy, asymptomatic workers to their homes when they're at no risk of infecting others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Public health [policies] are not arbitrary. They're built on what we know about the virus and how it's transmitted,&quot; said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. &quot;I, at least, find no real scientific reason to oblige people who've come back from west Africa to be quarantined in their home, to have their movements curtailed, to have their civil liberties curtailed, if they have no real symptoms and if they're in a monitoring program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State guidelines have evolved quickly over the last week. New quarantine measures have been variously announced by both politicians and health departments. While new policies look to curb anxiety, not all are not entirely transparent or based on science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance on Monday, recommending six states undertake active monitoring programs. Effectively, this means health departments call returning travelers once a day, and require those in direct contact with Ebola patients report their temperatures. Those six states - New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia - receive about 70% of travelers from Ebola affected areas in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some states do not believe the CDC's guidelines are enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox was quarantined in an in-hospital tent in the confusion following New Jersey's policy change. Hickox flew into Newark airport on Friday following volunteer work in Sierra Leone. The nurse was questioned and held at the airport in Newark for almost seven hours before being placed into mandatory quarantine in the city's University Hospital. Though Hickox was released, it's unclear whether the policy has officially changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox is suing on the grounds that the mandatory quarantine violated her civil rights and was scientifically unfounded. While she was allowed to leave the hospital, New Jersey governor Chris Christie maintains he has not changed the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandatory quarantine measures have exposed two conflicting needs: to counter public concern, and the need to recruit volunteer healthcare workers to the fight against Ebola in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are other ways to adequately address both public anxiety and health imperatives,&quot; said Sophie Delaunay, executive director of Doctors Without Borders in a statement on Monday. She said that adding a three-week quarantine period to normal tours of between four and six weeks could severely hamper recruitment efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The response to Ebola must not be guided primarily by panic in countries not overly affected by the epidemic,&quot; Delaunay said. &quot;Any regulation not based on scientific medical grounds, which would isolate healthy aid workers, will very likely serve as a disincentive to others to combat the epidemic at its source, in west Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Britain's role in Europe</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso's comments on the UK's relationship with the EU highlight the longstanding contradiction in English attitudes to its neighbours (24 October). On the one hand, it is not all right for Brussels to maintain collective jurisdiction over British affairs, but it is all right for London to maintain collective jurisdiction over Scottish affairs. The clamour south of the border to keep the union shortly before the Scottish referendum stands in sharp contrast to the will to respect the other union we have, with Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you join a club, you expect to respect commonly accepted rules. This is true for Britain in the EU now, as it was in 1707 when Scotland joined England and Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Westminster wants power to return to Britain, then it is perfectly logical for Scots to want power to return to Scotland. I am not sure that has been perfectly understood south of the border. Trevor RiggEdinburgh, UK</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Not so long ago, a local was complaining to me about so-called immigrants who had come to take advantage of the host country's generous benefits. There were so many of them, she complained, that their foreign-language dominated conversations in the school playground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complainant was French, the so-called immigrants British. I'm not sure that David Cameron has thought through all the consequences of his latest knee-jerk reaction to Ukip. Simon CoatesBrussels, Belgium</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; When David Cameron claims that he can renegotiate the rules regarding European immigration, a representative of the EU asserts that the free movement of labour is an integral part of the Common Market. And that is the whole trouble, and I wouldn't bet on Cameron being able to change it. But it is nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The free movement of tomatoes and washing machines across European borders is one thing: they are merely commodities to be bought and sold. The free movement of labour is a qualitatively different thing. People have families and relationships; they need somewhere to live; they travel; they need access to doctors and hospitals; their children need schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already have a home-grown baby boom to cope with, but in addition we have thousands of people arriving every year from abroad, mostly from Europe, whose needs have to be met as well. It cannot go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder Nigel Farage and Ukip are raking in the votes. It is not about keeping out the foreigners; it is not racism or any other form of discrimination. It is simply about the number of people on a small island and the rate at which we can absorb and provide for more. It has to slow down or stop. Martin DownWitney, UK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Regarding Jonathan Freedland's piece on Dad's Army (17 October) : Nigel Farage evokes a bygone Britain that would have been instantly recognisable to William Faulkner. In writing stories of the defeated south, he used to comment, &quot;The past is present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up in California, land of the future, I never understood this until my visiting southern aunt &quot;explained&quot; sotto voce that the family lost their money a century ago &quot;after buying Confederate bonds&quot;: this turned out to be rubbish, but so much more entertaining - and enduring- than the truth. I hope events will prove us able to forget Farage as a flash in the pan. Meanwhile, how about a Steve Bell cartoon? You know, with pan. Linda AgerbakArlington, Massachusetts, US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Jonathan Freedland wheels out &quot;the foundation stone of British Euroscepticism&quot;, ie &quot;that memory of standing alone against the Nazi menace&quot;. May I remind him and lots of other Brits that there was a second army, the Brits' first non-empire allies: namely, the Polish army that had regrouped in Scotland after defeat in Poland and being let down in France? My father was a captain in that army. After D-day they landed along with the Canadians and made their way to Bremerhaven. The officers were advised not to go back to Poland after the war, which accounts, incidentally, for my birth in Glasgow, along with other Scottish/Polish kids. Richard DudaVillers-les-Nancy, France<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">IMF and global recovery</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, according to the IMF, recovery is being driven by the US and the UK (17 October). Pity that the facing page informs us that real earnings of British workers have decreased for seven years in a row (Pay squeeze worst since Victorian age). Am I missing something? Or is this an accurate definition of the IMF's priorities? Giorgio RanalliOttawa, Canada</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder that global economic growth may never recover to pre-crisis levels, as warned by the IMF. The crisis was caused by our living beyond our means, spending, not investing, with banks and others looking for borrowers only to increase levels of personal debt. Adrian BethamLondon, UK<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The real risk of Ebola</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to sound hysterical, but am I the only person seeing a huge disconnect between the headline Ebola spreads a global warning (10 October) and the subheading Experts say flu outbreak would pose a bigger risk, accompanied by a photograph of health workers in full Hazmat gear?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the disease is less difficult to contract than the flu, I should have thought that rubber gloves and a surgical face mask would be enough protection. But then in the same Guardian issue we are told there are five Ebola cases every hour in Sierra Leone, with a prediction of 10 per hour before the end of October. Doesn't sound like a low-level risk to me. Rhona DaviesKelowna, British Columbia, Canada<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Which American values?</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the situation in northern Iraq-Syria, the patent failure of the war the US started in 2003 is more obvious than ever. But after the policies that brought such destabilisation and mayhem, the US has some responsibilities there and cannot simply turn its back and look away from the barbaric (or any other adjective) deeds committed by Isis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, I haven't read anything lately about Guant&aacute;namo. Yes, remember those 130 or so prisoners still held captive, some for more than 12 years, without trial or even charges and force fed when on hunger strike? A really barbaric (or any adjective you prefer) situation indeed. In his speeches, Barack Obama always refers to the &quot;American values&quot; and &quot;who we are&quot;. Really, by releasing at last the Guant&aacute;namo prisoners, the US Congress would show more against barbarism than air strikes which, when they kill five jihadis, 50 new fighters are sent in (17 October). Marc JachymLes Ulis, France<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Threats to the planet</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if leaders from every nation united and built a space-age defence system that could protect every city on Earth from a meteorite impact, it would only highlight how complacent they've been about tackling threats to life on this planet (17 October). Asteroid impacts are rare and inevitable, as Peter Jenniskens points out; on the other hand, taking steps to protect humans from each other, and the planet from humans, is a realistic and necessary goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's leaders cannot seem to deal with reality or necessity very well, though. I suspect that's because doing so would require them to be realistic about the impact of their own ambitions, which are a far greater threat to human survival than any meteorite could be. A ElliottBerlin, Germany<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Briefly</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; As a CNES project scientist, I was very pleased to read the short science article (17 October) entitled Satellite map of sea floor. However, as specified in the acknowledgments of the original Science article, two satellite altimeter missions were used to enhance the new sea floor maps: CryoSat-2 data was provided by the European Space Agency, and Jason-1 data by Nasa and the French space agency, CNES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, on the CNES side, we worked very hard with all of the different scientific communities to find an orbit that provided excellent new observations of the sea floor, and continued to make regular observations of the ocean dynamics. So it was a bit galling that our long partnership with Nasa for the Jason series was not correctly specified. Rosemary MorrowToulouse, France</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Referring to the &quot;state-owned&quot; SaskPower International is wrong (10 October), as in Canada we do not have &quot;states&quot;. It should have read &quot;provincial/government owned&quot;, as we have provinces in this country. Janet DowneyManotick, Ontario, Canada</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; I enjoy my Guardian Weekly, not least because of its careful political correctness. So you will understand my dismay to read Stephen Moss's glorification of the Dull Men's Club (10 October). He missed the big story and entirely ignored the tough questions: are women members permitted? Is there a Ladies Auxiliary? When will the name be changed to The Dull Persons Club? Seems this article slipped through the Guardian's PC screen. Bob WalshWilton, Connecticut, US</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       McConnell wouldn't directly answer whether he believes in climate change.                       Enquirer's editorial board volleyed several questions about what it would take to convince him of climate change. He turned the subject every time to jobs. McConnell said he believes imposing regulations to reduce greenhouse gases blamed for climate change would only hurt America and not mitigate what other countries, such as China, are doing...                       &quot;We can debate this forever,&quot; McConnell said. &quot;George Will had a column in the last year or so pointing out that in the 70s, we were concerned the ice age was coming. I'm not a scientist. I'm interested in protecting Kentucky's economy.&quot;                     </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving aside McConnell's reference to the 1970s ice age myth, the cop-out about not being a scientist is a strange and dangerous one. Most members of Congress aren't scientists, or doctors, or military experts, or teachers, and yet they set our country's science, health care, defense, and education policy. Usually they do this by listening to the experts in each subject, which is the smart approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, as Lee Papa has pointed out, McConnell had no hesitations in expressing his opinions about dealing with the threat of Ebola and deferring to the experts at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       I'm not an expert on this, but it strikes me that it would be a good idea to discontinue flights into the United States from that part of the world... I think we ought to listen to what the CDC thinks they need either in terms of financing or certainly they'll decide the procedures for travel and all the rest. I think we need to follow the advice of the experts who know how to fight scourges like this                     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These comments stand in stark contrast to McConnell's unwillingness to take a position on human-caused global warming, or to listen to the climate scientist experts on the subject. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McConnell is far from alone - this refrain has become one of the most popular responses among Republican politicians when asked about the climate. &quot;I'm not a scientist&quot; is used to abdicate responsibility for mitigating the immense risks posed by climate change. This abdication would be considered unacceptable in the face of other threats like ISIS and Ebola, and the same should be true for global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to climate change, the expert consensus is clear. Humans are causing global warming, and the resulting climate changes ( more damaging extreme weather, for example) on the whole are harmful and dangerous. There are ways to reduce carbon pollution at a lower cost than paying for the immense damages caused by unabated climate change. In fact, there are small government, free market solutions that appeal to political conservatives and would reduce carbon pollution while growing the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that the Democratic Party is taking climate change seriously. President Obama has shown strong leadership on the issue in his second term, Democratic Senators are drawing increasing attention to it, and many Democratic candidates running for office are speaking up about the need for climate action. Climate Hawks Vote has a good list of those candidates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, many Republican politicians receive substantial campaign funding from fossil fuel companies. Many also rely on the most conservative Americans as their voting base, and those voters have been misinformed about climate change by the conservative media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of that media bias, climate change is treated as a political, cultural, and ideological topic in the United States instead of a scientific and risk management issue. In the rare case where Republican politicians show responsible leadership in trying to tackle global warming, their jobs are threatened. Thus rather than showing leadership to address our greatest long-term threat, Republican politicians resort to abdicating responsibility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as Neal deGrasse Tyson says,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.                     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences of climate change are becoming more and more undeniable. It's only a matter of time before climate denial becomes a losing political position, and the Republican Party pays the price for its years of obstructing climate policies. The question is whether anyone in the party will step up and demonstrate responsible leadership before it's too late for the GOP and the climate. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.00pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PUP senator Jacqui Lambie is railing about terrorists on welfare and with the right to vote. She is going out beyond the foreign fighters bill, saying Tony Abbott has turned a blind eye to home grown terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is going back to section 44 of the constitution and has urged that the powers should be expanded to strip people of their allegiance to foreign powers and their right to vote. Currently you can't bear allegiance to a foreign power and be in the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are going to carry on with that sort of rot, the first thing we have to ensure is that they do not receive any government funds or entitlements and don't have the right to vote and a deported immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.48pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scott Ludlam said the Greens would oppose the plans to share biometric materials which identify faces at airports, which he calls &quot;one of the most troubling aspects of the bill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says it passes automatic surveillance activities over the entire population and he quotes the privacy commissioner urging a review of privacy aspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the extraordinary haste rushing the bill through the parliament was reflected today in the explanatory memoranda just being presented to the senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ink was still wet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.42pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the middle of foreign fighters, the higher education (university deregulation) report has been released. This from Daniel Hurst :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Coalition-dominated committee has called on the government to rethink the proposed increase to student loan interest rates, warning of &quot;unforeseen impacts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate's Education and Employment Legislation Committee recommended the parliament pass the bill to remove caps on university fees, but suggested &quot;a structural adjustment package to assist certain sections of the higher education sector transition to a fully deregulated system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor and the Greens published dissenting reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.37pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Greens senator Scott Ludlam says Labor has waved through the first national security bill and will wave through this second one - the foreign fighters bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again left to the crossbenchers to be the opposition on this debate...It is left to the crossbenchers to provide that critical thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.34pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greens senator Scott Ludlam picks up the point on the foreign fighters bill that Australians fighting overseas is nothing new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would be interested to know whether the government has given any thought to combatants on both sides who might have travelled to Gaza during Israel's recent bombardment there? Or whether somehow they are not to be considered within the scope of this legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ludlam says the crossbenchers were not allowed to scrutinise the legislation in the senate committee because the government removed any crossbench representation - as a result it was a major party show which will be pushed through the parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.26pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor senator Stephen Conroy says the bill does deliver greater powers for intelligence and law enforcement agencies but it also delivers important safeguards. He commends the bill to the senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.19pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we have had the Liberal senator Dean Smith's human rights committee asking the government to justify itself on human rights breaches in the foreign fighters bill. Now we have Labor's Stephen Conroy saying Australia's laws have to evolve to meet the changing environment and the most recent threat is Australians going abroad to fight with foreign forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.11pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberal Senator Dean Smith reminded the senate that the human rights committee's job was to undertake a &quot;technical and bipartisan&quot; examination of legislation &quot;in the absence of partisan politics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said the committee expects ministers to justify the need for human rights limitations in any laws in each &quot;statement of compatibility&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislation can limit human rights if it can be shown to be reasonable necessary and proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate objective...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement of compatibility does not fully explain why the measures are necessary in pursuit of a legitimate objective, in particular it does not explain how and why existing law enforcement and intelligence gathering powers are insufficient to prevent serious threats to Australia's national security interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith says the committee is seeking further explanation from attorney general George Brandis, who is responsible for the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.50pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberal committee chair critical of foreign fighter human rights breaches  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal senator Dean Smith, the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, has delivered a report from the 10 member multiparty committee which scrutinises legislation for its impact on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's report is particularly timely in relation to the foreign fighters bill due to be debated tonight in the senate. The report identifies a number of &quot;possible breaches&quot; of human rights and then calls for the government to justify infringements of of basic human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was Smith in the senate in the last hour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the ambition of this committee to be inconvenient to the desire and duty of governments to protect citizens from the harm of others and the deliberate evils of terrorism. But the scrutiny role of this committee in this senate must always be to shine a light on real and possible breaches of those fundamental rights and liberties; the right of freedom for arbitrary detention, the right to freedom of movement, the right to a fair trial, the right to presumption of innocence, the right to privacy, the rights to freedom of expression and association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.23pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has joined the chorus condemning the petrol excise rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman John Osborn says the charges place extra pressure on business and is &quot;anti-growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business understands the government's challenge to balance the budget and supports many measures to cut spending and return to surplus. However, there is very little reason to raise fuel excise, which already far outstretches spending on roads, other than to increase consolidated revenues. It's been estimated that only about a third of the fuel excise revenue is currently spent on roads. ACCI's longstanding view is that fuel excise should only be applied for road transport reasons where these taxes are hypothecated to direct investment back into roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.02pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are still waiting around for the senate report into the higher education changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just taking stock as we slide towards the evening, we have the foreign fighters bill back on in the senate after the dinner adjournment until 10pm and the house is expected to rise no later than 9pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tony Abbott is addressing the Business Council of Australia in Sydney after 8pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 4.37pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And poor old Denis Napthine must be thinking, with friends like this....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Victorian premier is quoted in The Age as mightily unimpressed with the petrol decision and particularly the federal government's decision to bypass parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a situation where any increase in the cost for fuel for Victorian families and Victorian business will hurt those families and businesses. And I would believe these sorts of things should go through the proper parliamentary processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 4.34pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Institute of Public Affairs is not happy with the Abbott government's decision to bypass the parliament over the fuel excise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government's decision today to ram petrol tax indexation past the Parliament is undemocratic and unnecessary. A fundamental democratic principle is that tax changes must be consented to by parliamentarians, as representatives of the Australian people, but the Abbott government will push through fuel tax indexation without debate, says IPA Senior Fellow Mikayla Novak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the prime minister himself said before the last election, Australia's budget problem 'is not a revenue problem. The problem is a spending problem'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burning a bigger tax hole through the wallets of motorists is not the most effective way to address a budget emergency. The Abbott government should redouble its efforts to cut government spending, and ditch this unnecessary and undemocratic tax hike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to the foreign fighters bill. Daniel Hurst has been trying to determine exactly what amendments Labor want to make to the foreign fighters bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's amendments would seek to alter the definition of the new offence of advocating terrorism to ensure it applied to someone who &quot;counsels&quot; the doing of terrorist acts, but not someone who &quot;promotes&quot; or &quot;encourages&quot; such acts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor also wants to expand the list of allowable exemptions to the international &quot;no-go zone&quot; provisions to include undertaking a pilgrimage to a place of religious importance or living in an area for an extended period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill's proposed exemptions include making a bona fide visit to a family member, but Labor wants to add &quot;or friend&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is a little academic, given Labor will not insist on the amendments in return for their votes of support in the senate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone is trying to clear up answers from question time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barnaby Joyce suggested in question time that Labor had no agriculture policy at the last election so Joel Fitzgibbon has reminded the house the National Farmers Federation gave Labor a high score than the Coalition on their election report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government question to Christopher Pyne : Will the minister explain why it's important to restore respect for the rule of law on building and construction sites in Australia and what threats exist to the government's plan for reform?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This goes to the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to know who the CFMEU is because I think many members of the public don't quite realise the kind of rogue union that we are talking about. This is a union that received a $1.5m record fine for criminal contempt of court just last year in 2014. So just thisyear in 2014 for its blockade of the Myer Emporium site. This is a union that's been found guilty of contempt of court 28times since the year 2000, with links to gangland bosses like Mick Gatto through its secretary, with links to the Comancheros and the Rebels bikie gangs. And Labor's response to this, Labor's response to this information about the CFMEU which is quite public has been to welcome it back in to the Victorian Labor Party, Pyne says.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney-General says that that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Iraq and Syria is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet, 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping Communists or Fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's policy on boat turn backs has not changed. It remains the same. The case hasn't been made out for change and furthermore, when we look at what has effectively helped discourage the people smugglers, the origin of the success of this measure is in Labor's regional settlement negotiations and regional processing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're confident it will be validated within 12 months, however the question for Bill Shorten and the question for Christine Milne is whether in 12 months time they want the additional revenue collected through this measure to be refunded to fuel manufacturers or fuel importers or whether they want to see this additional revenue invested in job creating productivity enhancing road infrastructure which will help us build a stronger more prosperous economy, which will help us repair the budget by helping to achieve, over time, increases in Government revenue on the back of stronger economic growth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petrol price rise after Coalition sidesteps the senate  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mathias Cormann, the man who appears to have taken over the budget, is announcing a measure to get around the pesky senate which refuses to pass the fuel excise indexation. He is increasing the &quot;duty&quot; or tax on fuel, to make up for the lack of indexation rise - which was due to take effect two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's part of the statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has decided to give practical effect to the fuel excise indexation Budget measure by way of tariff proposals to be validated by Parliament within 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tariff proposals will be tabled in the House of Representatives this week and will take effect from 10 November 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As per the 'alcopops' precedent used by the previous government, these excise and customs tariff proposals will allow the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to collect the adjusted rate of fuel duty from that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consistent with the Budget measure, the increase in fuel excise will be modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 10 November 2014, the rate of fuel duty will increase from 38.143 cents per litre to 38.6 cents per litre, the rate which would have applied if relevant legislation had been passed by Parliament prior to 1 August 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indexation of fuel duty will then return to biannual CPI indexation from 1 February 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a typical household, which consumes 50 litres of fuel per week the estimated price impact of this fuel excise indexation will be about 40 cents per week by the end of 2014-15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I promised to come back to the Clive Palmer interview. I won't begin to pretend to understand the first point he was making on the GST. But in the second, he was trying to make the point that the GST is a regressive tax and that the government wanted to &quot;get&quot; the people under the income tax threshold to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all you have to understand that 90% of all GST collected is refunded to businesses and people like that. So if you want to raise more revenue you could just make businesses get 95% revenue and you would get more than the GST that is collected at the moment but the government won't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So GST is about taxing PAYE workers without actually allowing them to have the benefit of the (income tax) threshold so it means the poorest people in Australia can pay while business people like me get exemption and get all our money refunded to us. It's just slight of hand, a bit of magic the prime minister's got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive does a great line as the anti-politician politician. It's a tried and true formula, used by political outsiders like Pauline Hanson. Even earlier, Don Chipp promised to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;. When asked about Abbott's call for a mature debate, Palmer forgot he is a politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly Tony Abbott isn't capable of mature debate, neither is parliament really. I don't know any politicians that are capable of mature debate. When I got to parliament, I looked down one side and thought these blokes know nothing, then I looked down the other side and thought these blokes know nothing and then I looked at the public service and though these blokes know absolutely nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Treasurer Joe Hockey this morning. Photograph: Mike Bowers Guardian Australia/Mike Bowers Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, before the Murdoch speech came out, Joe Hockey took a government question in question time on the state of the global economy. He had a very similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental challenge now for the global economy is when loose monetary policy has done its work and unfortunately made the rich richer through rising asset values but loose monetary policy has effectively been exhausted as a lever to stimulate economic growth on a global basis. Loose fiscal policy-that is, government spending hand over fist-is now limited because they do not have the money to be able to continue to do that and put it on the credit card forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that the only option for the earning of growth into the future is structural reform. That means having a more competitive world with deregulated labour markets, with barriers to increase protection put up by various countries and making sure that we undertake the domestic reforms in both our budget and the economy to build a stronger economy and ultimately deliver more jobs. That is the only way you can do it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Hockey was asked about the Murdoch prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Uhlmann asked: Joe Hockey, do you agree with Rupert Murdoch's assessment? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, certainly, as he says, loose monetary policy has helped people who own a lot of assets to become richer, and that's why loose monetary policy needs to be reversed over time, and we'll get back to normal levels of monetary policy, normal levels of interest rates. Governments, on the other hand, have also run out of money and can't keep spending money - particularly on the credit card - to try and stimulate growth. So, if loose monetary policy is not available, and actually makes the rich get richer, and governments have run out of money, how are we going to get growth going in the world economy over the next few years? And the only way to do it is through structural changes that make us better at what we do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill Shorten is launching a campaign against the government's higher education changes which would deregulate university fees, increase student loan interest rates and reduce government subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking to the Labor caucus room, summoning up the spirit of Gough, saying university places should be awarded on &quot;hard marks&quot; or rather &quot;good marks and hard work&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will fight the Liberals debt sentence and we will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senate will be debating the bill, which is why Labor is campaigning on the issue. There will be TV ads down the track and an online campaign.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech for the G20, billed as a &quot;confronting message&quot; for world ministers and central bankers, Murdoch warned there was a risk to &quot;the ladder of generational progress&quot; in the developed world. There was a &quot;massive shift&quot; in policies to benefit the super rich. A &quot;great global reckoning&quot; has arrived. This is a time when &quot;great leaders are fashioned&quot;. We should all be concerned about polarisation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until you get to this point, you may think Rupert has been reading too much Thomas Piketty. Until:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In America, the most highly paid 1% now pay 46% of all income tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the solution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Medicare co-payment languishes in the senate, last night the prime minister co-opted medical researches to lobby senators for the funding mechanism for the $20bn research fund announced in the budget. Tony Abbott was speaking to the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. We learnt that not only does Abbott want to be an infrastructure prime minister and a prime minister for indigenous Australia, but a prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some of you might know, when I was the health minister some years ago I regarded myself as the health minister for medical research and now I'd like to regard myself as the prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he reminded the researchers, if they want their dosh, they have to start knocking on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the funding mechanism is controversial; we are asking for a modest co-payment from people who are visiting their general practitioner. No one likes to pay more for anything, but it seems to me that if it's fair and reasonable for people to make a modest contribution when they get their PBS drugs - the drugs that so many of you have made such a contribution towards - why isn't it also fair and reasonable for this modest contribution when you visit the doctor, particularly when for quite a few years all of the proceeds are going to be invested in what will be a world changing fund, in what will help people's lives, not just here, but right around the world? This is history making, this is culture shifting, this is life changing. So, my request to all of you in this room tonight: please don't leave tomorrow without knocking on the door of a crossbench Senator and saying, &quot;For our country's sake - for our country's sake, for the world's sake - have a look at this fund&quot;.</SPAN></P>

But while the shocking poverty of these countries provides the fertile ground for the disease to spread, there are bigger issues at play that ought to cause us to think about the macroeconomic conditions that brought us to this point.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola - like HIV, anthrax, Sars, avian flu and other pandemics of recent years - is a zoonotic virus, one that has crossed from animals to humans. It was first identified in 1976 during near-simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strain of Ebola implicated in the current outbreak is thought to have originated from a mutant pathogen found in fruit bats. This is where we see a direct connection with economic development. The conflicts which have done so much damage to the affected countries have also attracted a range of activities - both legal and illicit - including logging and extractive industries like bauxite mining, which have deforested large swathes of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This massacre of the natural environment has reduced biodiversity and pushed the remaining fauna into closer contact with humans. So the fruit bats forced out of former rainforest are now seeking food from human settlements - and becoming food themselves, with the disastrous consequences we are now seeing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is thought that Ebola is &quot;introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we already know that the risk doesn't only come from so-called &quot;bushmeat&quot; - intensive animal husbandry and battery farming can produce the same results, as we have seen with the avian and swine flus of recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These diseases not only kill people, they also devastate the productive bases of economies. The World Bank has already estimated that the economic cost of Ebola to the countries of west Africa could be as high as $32.6bn (&pound;20.2bn) by the end of 2015. But for fragile economies already teetering on the brink, this represents an incalculable human catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to face up to the fact that as we are making increasing demands on habitats and exploiting animals more intensively for foodstuffs, the risk of zoonotic infections will increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These outbreaks can become global pandemics very quickly, so there is a case for early intervention. In the case of Ebola, the international community failed to act quickly enough and we are now paying the price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the global north is only now responding in earnest serves only to highlight the general indifference with which it regards the spread of infectious diseases in Africa. In fact, however, we have a lot to learn from those countries - the DRC, Nigeria and Senegal - which have already succeeded in containing the virus, despite their limited healthcare and sanitary infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now should also be a time for some soul-searching. If we choose to acknowledge it, we can discern that Ebola and diseases like it are the product of a global economic model that is destructive and exploitative to the point of creating serious risks to human health - from possible pandemics, but also the ongoing effects of man-made climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At University College London, our new Institute for Global Prosperity is taking a &quot;whole university&quot; approach to examining the world's greatest challenges and thinking about ways we could do things differently. It's about recognising the context of global interconnectivity and thinking hard about the impact on prosperity for all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, companies that are involved in natural resources extraction need to think about the long-term impact of activities like timber logging and mining because they cut down the buffer between humans and animals and thereby increase the chance of pathogenic mutation. So as well as direct harm to the natural environment, there's a potential knock-on effect on human societies and economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to think of alternative development paths and this means a reassessment of the notion of profit. Suppose our business models were not just calculated in monetary terms, or return to shareholders, but were based on what the business contributed to the creation of social value and the long-term sustainability of the environment, on which the future of both business and communities depend? There needs to be recognition of the consequences of not doing so, which are very deleterious not just for individual countries but potentially for others around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't absolve governments of their responsibilities for setting the regulatory framework and enforcement regimes. But as the engine of the global economy, businesses have a vital role to play in creating social and environmental value.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has joined the chorus condemning the petrol excise rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman John Osborn says the charges place extra pressure on business and is &quot;anti-growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business understands the government's challenge to balance the budget and supports many measures to cut spending and return to surplus. However, there is very little reason to raise fuel excise, which already far outstretches spending on roads, other than to increase consolidated revenues. It's been estimated that only about a third of the fuel excise revenue is currently spent on roads. ACCI's longstanding view is that fuel excise should only be applied for road transport reasons where these taxes are hypothecated to direct investment back into roads.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And poor old Denis Napthine must be thinking, with friends like this....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Victorian premier is quoted in The Age as mightily unimpressed with the petrol decision and particularly the federal government's decision to bypass parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a situation where any increase in the cost for fuel for Victorian families and Victorian business will hurt those families and businesses. And I would believe these sorts of things should go through the proper parliamentary processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 4.34pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       The Institute of Public Affairs is not happy with the Abbott government's decision to bypass the parliament over the fuel excise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government's decision today to ram petrol tax indexation past the Parliament is undemocratic and unnecessary. A fundamental democratic principle is that tax changes must be consented to by parliamentarians, as representatives of the Australian people, but the Abbott government will push through fuel tax indexation without debate, says IPA Senior Fellow Mikayla Novak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the prime minister himself said before the last election, Australia's budget problem 'is not a revenue problem. The problem is a spending problem'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burning a bigger tax hole through the wallets of motorists is not the most effective way to address a budget emergency. The Abbott government should redouble its efforts to cut government spending, and ditch this unnecessary and undemocratic tax hike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to the foreign fighters bill. Daniel Hurst has been trying to determine exactly what amendments Labor want to make to the foreign fighters bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's amendments would seek to alter the definition of the new offence of advocating terrorism to ensure it applied to someone who &quot;counsels&quot; the doing of terrorist acts, but not someone who &quot;promotes&quot; or &quot;encourages&quot; such acts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor also wants to expand the list of allowable exemptions to the international &quot;no-go zone&quot; provisions to include undertaking a pilgrimage to a place of religious importance or living in an area for an extended period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill's proposed exemptions include making a bona fide visit to a family member, but Labor wants to add &quot;or friend&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is a little academic, given Labor will not insist on the amendments in return for their votes of support in the senate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government question to Christopher Pyne : Will the minister explain why it's important to restore respect for the rule of law on building and construction sites in Australia and what threats exist to the government's plan for reform?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This goes to the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to know who the CFMEU is because I think many members of the public don't quite realise the kind of rogue union that we are talking about. This is a union that received a $1.5m record fine for criminal contempt of court just last year in 2014. So just thisyear in 2014 for its blockade of the Myer Emporium site. This is a union that's been found guilty of contempt of court 28times since the year 2000, with links to gangland bosses like Mick Gatto through its secretary, with links to the Comancheros and the Rebels bikie gangs. And Labor's response to this, Labor's response to this information about the CFMEU which is quite public has been to welcome it back in to the Victorian Labor Party, Pyne says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uproar ensues and Speaker Bishop picks up an unparliamentary interjection and asks for its withdrawal.</SPAN></P>

Young men with limited skills and an aggressive cast of mind have always been attracted to violence, and have often committed crimes.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leyonhjelm is making the point - similar to the one made by senator Peter Whish-Wilson which caused a stir - that terrorism is in the eye of the beholder so making laws for it is tricky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It clearly hasn't occurred to the Attorney-General that some countries and societies actually make good candidates for subverting: Zimbabwe, for example, or North Korea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bill has nothing to do with defeating Da'ish in Syria or Iraq. And it will not keep us safer here in Australia. The Attorney-General says that that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Iraq and Syria is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet, 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping Communists or Fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mathias Cormann, the man who appears to have taken over the budget, is announcing a measure to get around the pesky senate which refuses to pass the fuel excise indexation. He is increasing the &quot;duty&quot; or tax on fuel, to make up for the lack of indexation rise - which was due to take effect two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's part of the statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has decided to give practical effect to the fuel excise indexation Budget measure by way of tariff proposals to be validated by Parliament within 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tariff proposals will be tabled in the House of Representatives this week and will take effect from 10 November 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As per the 'alcopops' precedent used by the previous government, these excise and customs tariff proposals will allow the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to collect the adjusted rate of fuel duty from that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consistent with the Budget measure, the increase in fuel excise will be modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 10 November 2014, the rate of fuel duty will increase from 38.143 cents per litre to 38.6 cents per litre, the rate which would have applied if relevant legislation had been passed by Parliament prior to 1 August 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indexation of fuel duty will then return to biannual CPI indexation from 1 February 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a typical household, which consumes 50 litres of fuel per week the estimated price impact of this fuel excise indexation will be about 40 cents per week by the end of 2014-15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I promised to come back to the Clive Palmer interview. I won't begin to pretend to understand the first point he was making on the GST. But in the second, he was trying to make the point that the GST is a regressive tax and that the government wanted to &quot;get&quot; the people under the income tax threshold to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all you have to understand that 90% of all GST collected is refunded to businesses and people like that. So if you want to raise more revenue you could just make businesses get 95% revenue and you would get more than the GST that is collected at the moment but the government won't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So GST is about taxing PAYE workers without actually allowing them to have the benefit of the (income tax) threshold so it means the poorest people in Australia can pay while business people like me get exemption and get all our money refunded to us. It's just slight of hand, a bit of magic the prime minister's got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive does a great line as the anti-politician politician. It's a tried and true formula, used by political outsiders like Pauline Hanson. Even earlier, Don Chipp promised to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;. When asked about Abbott's call for a mature debate, Palmer forgot he is a politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly Tony Abbott isn't capable of mature debate, neither is parliament really. I don't know any politicians that are capable of mature debate. When I got to parliament, I looked down one side and thought these blokes know nothing, then I looked down the other side and thought these blokes know nothing and then I looked at the public service and though these blokes know absolutely nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Treasurer Joe Hockey this morning. Photograph: Mike Bowers Guardian Australia/Mike Bowers Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, before the Murdoch speech came out, Joe Hockey took a government question in question time on the state of the global economy. He had a very similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental challenge now for the global economy is when loose monetary policy has done its work and unfortunately made the rich richer through rising asset values but loose monetary policy has effectively been exhausted as a lever to stimulate economic growth on a global basis. Loose fiscal policy-that is, government spending hand over fist-is now limited because they do not have the money to be able to continue to do that and put it on the credit card forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that the only option for the earning of growth into the future is structural reform. That means having a more competitive world with deregulated labour markets, with barriers to increase protection put up by various countries and making sure that we undertake the domestic reforms in both our budget and the economy to build a stronger economy and ultimately deliver more jobs. That is the only way you can do it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Hockey was asked about the Murdoch prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Uhlmann asked: Joe Hockey, do you agree with Rupert Murdoch's assessment? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, certainly, as he says, loose monetary policy has helped people who own a lot of assets to become richer, and that's why loose monetary policy needs to be reversed over time, and we'll get back to normal levels of monetary policy, normal levels of interest rates. Governments, on the other hand, have also run out of money and can't keep spending money - particularly on the credit card - to try and stimulate growth. So, if loose monetary policy is not available, and actually makes the rich get richer, and governments have run out of money, how are we going to get growth going in the world economy over the next few years? And the only way to do it is through structural changes that make us better at what we do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill Shorten is launching a campaign against the government's higher education changes which would deregulate university fees, increase student loan interest rates and reduce government subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking to the Labor caucus room, summoning up the spirit of Gough, saying university places should be awarded on &quot;hard marks&quot; or rather &quot;good marks and hard work&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will fight the Liberals debt sentence and we will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senate will be debating the bill, which is why Labor is campaigning on the issue. There will be TV ads down the track and an online campaign. Palmer has already said his senators will not be supporting the bill. The government needs six out of the eight crossbenchers to get it through, which is not looking likely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like ornate book ends, Rupert Murdoch and the PM's business advisor Maurice Newman have some interesting offerings on world prosperity and global cohesion this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech for the G20, billed as a &quot;confronting message&quot; for world ministers and central bankers, Murdoch warned there was a risk to &quot;the ladder of generational progress&quot; in the developed world. There was a &quot;massive shift&quot; in policies to benefit the super rich. A &quot;great global reckoning&quot; has arrived. This is a time when &quot;great leaders are fashioned&quot;. We should all be concerned about polarisation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until you get to this point, you may think Rupert has been reading too much Thomas Piketty. Until:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In America, the most highly paid 1% now pay 46% of all income tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's only so much governments can do, says Murdoch. Essentially, governments need to get out of the way and provide:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Medicare co-payment languishes in the senate, last night the prime minister co-opted medical researches to lobby senators for the funding mechanism for the $20bn research fund announced in the budget. Tony Abbott was speaking to the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. We learnt that not only does Abbott want to be an infrastructure prime minister and a prime minister for indigenous Australia, but a prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some of you might know, when I was the health minister some years ago I regarded myself as the health minister for medical research and now I'd like to regard myself as the prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he reminded the researchers, if they want their dosh, they have to start knocking on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the funding mechanism is controversial; we are asking for a modest co-payment from people who are visiting their general practitioner. No one likes to pay more for anything, but it seems to me that if it's fair and reasonable for people to make a modest contribution when they get their PBS drugs - the drugs that so many of you have made such a contribution towards - why isn't it also fair and reasonable for this modest contribution when you visit the doctor, particularly when for quite a few years all of the proceeds are going to be invested in what will be a world changing fund, in what will help people's lives, not just here, but right around the world? This is history making, this is culture shifting, this is life changing. So, my request to all of you in this room tonight: please don't leave tomorrow without knocking on the door of a crossbench Senator and saying, &quot;For our country's sake - for our country's sake, for the world's sake - have a look at this fund&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a situation where any increase in the cost for fuel for Victorian families and Victorian business will hurt those families and businesses. And I would believe these sorts of things should go through the proper parliamentary processes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       The Institute of Public Affairs is not happy with the Abbott government's decision to bypass the parliament over the fuel excise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government's decision today to ram petrol tax indexation past the Parliament is undemocratic and unnecessary. A fundamental democratic principle is that tax changes must be consented to by parliamentarians, as representatives of the Australian people, but the Abbott government will push through fuel tax indexation without debate, says IPA Senior Fellow Mikayla Novak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the prime minister himself said before the last election, Australia's budget problem 'is not a revenue problem. The problem is a spending problem'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burning a bigger tax hole through the wallets of motorists is not the most effective way to address a budget emergency. The Abbott government should redouble its efforts to cut government spending, and ditch this unnecessary and undemocratic tax hike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's amendments would seek to alter the definition of the new offence of advocating terrorism to ensure it applied to someone who &quot;counsels&quot; the doing of terrorist acts, but not someone who &quot;promotes&quot; or &quot;encourages&quot; such acts. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is a little academic, given Labor will not insist on the amendments in return for their votes of support in the senate.</SPAN></P>

This is a union that's been found guilty of contempt of court 28times since the year 2000, with links to gangland bosses like Mick Gatto through its secretary, with links to the Comancheros and the Rebels bikie gangs.

Young men with limited skills and an aggressive cast of mind have always been attracted to violence, and have often committed crimes.

The Attorney-General says that that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Iraq and Syria is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet, 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping Communists or Fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime.

You want these sort of people to take risks so you get the Googles, the Apples, the Yahoos, they are not going to take risks if they have $200,000 debt already and they have a woman that loves them and wants to have children and we become a society with no ideas at all.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're confident it will be validated within 12 months, however the question for Bill Shorten and the question for Christine Milne is whether in 12 months time they want the additional revenue collected through this measure to be refunded to fuel manufacturers or fuel importers or whether they want to see this additional revenue invested in job creating productivity enhancing road infrastructure which will help us build a stronger more prosperous economy, which will help us repair the budget by helping to achieve, over time, increases in Government revenue on the back of stronger economic growth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petrol price rise after Coalition sidesteps the senate  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mathias Cormann, the man who appears to have taken over the budget, is announcing a measure to get around the pesky senate which refuses to pass the fuel excise indexation. He is increasing the &quot;duty&quot; or tax on fuel, to make up for the lack of indexation rise - which was due to take effect two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's part of the statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has decided to give practical effect to the fuel excise indexation Budget measure by way of tariff proposals to be validated by Parliament within 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tariff proposals will be tabled in the House of Representatives this week and will take effect from 10 November 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As per the 'alcopops' precedent used by the previous government, these excise and customs tariff proposals will allow the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to collect the adjusted rate of fuel duty from that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consistent with the Budget measure, the increase in fuel excise will be modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 10 November 2014, the rate of fuel duty will increase from 38.143 cents per litre to 38.6 cents per litre, the rate which would have applied if relevant legislation had been passed by Parliament prior to 1 August 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indexation of fuel duty will then return to biannual CPI indexation from 1 February 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a typical household, which consumes 50 litres of fuel per week the estimated price impact of this fuel excise indexation will be about 40 cents per week by the end of 2014-15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I promised to come back to the Clive Palmer interview. I won't begin to pretend to understand the first point he was making on the GST. But in the second, he was trying to make the point that the GST is a regressive tax and that the government wanted to &quot;get&quot; the people under the income tax threshold to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all you have to understand that 90% of all GST collected is refunded to businesses and people like that. So if you want to raise more revenue you could just make businesses get 95% revenue and you would get more than the GST that is collected at the moment but the government won't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So GST is about taxing PAYE workers without actually allowing them to have the benefit of the (income tax) threshold so it means the poorest people in Australia can pay while business people like me get exemption and get all our money refunded to us. It's just slight of hand, a bit of magic the prime minister's got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive does a great line as the anti-politician politician. It's a tried and true formula, used by political outsiders like Pauline Hanson. Even earlier, Don Chipp promised to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;. When asked about Abbott's call for a mature debate, Palmer forgot he is a politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly Tony Abbott isn't capable of mature debate, neither is parliament really. I don't know any politicians that are capable of mature debate. When I got to parliament, I looked down one side and thought these blokes know nothing, then I looked down the other side and thought these blokes know nothing and then I looked at the public service and though these blokes know absolutely nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Treasurer Joe Hockey this morning. Photograph: Mike Bowers Guardian Australia/Mike Bowers Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, before the Murdoch speech came out, Joe Hockey took a government question in question time on the state of the global economy. He had a very similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental challenge now for the global economy is when loose monetary policy has done its work and unfortunately made the rich richer through rising asset values but loose monetary policy has effectively been exhausted as a lever to stimulate economic growth on a global basis. Loose fiscal policy-that is, government spending hand over fist-is now limited because they do not have the money to be able to continue to do that and put it on the credit card forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that the only option for the earning of growth into the future is structural reform. That means having a more competitive world with deregulated labour markets, with barriers to increase protection put up by various countries and making sure that we undertake the domestic reforms in both our budget and the economy to build a stronger economy and ultimately deliver more jobs. That is the only way you can do it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Hockey was asked about the Murdoch prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Uhlmann asked: Joe Hockey, do you agree with Rupert Murdoch's assessment? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, certainly, as he says, loose monetary policy has helped people who own a lot of assets to become richer, and that's why loose monetary policy needs to be reversed over time, and we'll get back to normal levels of monetary policy, normal levels of interest rates. Governments, on the other hand, have also run out of money and can't keep spending money - particularly on the credit card - to try and stimulate growth. So, if loose monetary policy is not available, and actually makes the rich get richer, and governments have run out of money, how are we going to get growth going in the world economy over the next few years? And the only way to do it is through structural changes that make us better at what we do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will fight the Liberals debt sentence and we will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senate will be debating the bill, which is why Labor is campaigning on the issue. There will be TV ads down the track and an online campaign.

There was a &quot;massive shift&quot; in policies to benefit the super rich. A &quot;great global reckoning&quot; has arrived. This is a time when &quot;great leaders are fashioned&quot;. We should all be concerned about polarisation, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Medicare co-payment languishes in the senate, last night the prime minister co-opted medical researches to lobby senators for the funding mechanism for the $20bn research fund announced in the budget. Tony Abbott was speaking to the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. We learnt that not only does Abbott want to be an infrastructure prime minister and a prime minister for indigenous Australia, but a prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some of you might know, when I was the health minister some years ago I regarded myself as the health minister for medical research and now I'd like to regard myself as the prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he reminded the researchers, if they want their dosh, they have to start knocking on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the funding mechanism is controversial; we are asking for a modest co-payment from people who are visiting their general practitioner. No one likes to pay more for anything, but it seems to me that if it's fair and reasonable for people to make a modest contribution when they get their PBS drugs - the drugs that so many of you have made such a contribution towards - why isn't it also fair and reasonable for this modest contribution when you visit the doctor, particularly when for quite a few years all of the proceeds are going to be invested in what will be a world changing fund, in what will help people's lives, not just here, but right around the world? This is history making, this is culture shifting, this is life changing. So, my request to all of you in this room tonight: please don't leave tomorrow without knocking on the door of a crossbench Senator and saying, &quot;For our country's sake - for our country's sake, for the world's sake - have a look at this fund&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to the foreign fighters bill. Daniel Hurst has been trying to determine exactly what amendments Labor want to make to the foreign fighters bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's amendments would seek to alter the definition of the new offence of advocating terrorism to ensure it applied to someone who &quot;counsels&quot; the doing of terrorist acts, but not someone who &quot;promotes&quot; or &quot;encourages&quot; such acts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor also wants to expand the list of allowable exemptions to the international &quot;no-go zone&quot; provisions to include undertaking a pilgrimage to a place of religious importance or living in an area for an extended period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill's proposed exemptions include making a bona fide visit to a family member, but Labor wants to add &quot;or friend&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is a little academic, given Labor will not insist on the amendments in return for their votes of support in the senate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaker Bishop notes Barnaby Joyce corrected the record and counselled his staff soon after the changes were pointed out in parliamentary question time.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.18pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone is trying to clear up answers from question time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barnaby Joyce suggested in question time that Labor had no agriculture policy at the last election so Joel Fitzgibbon has reminded the house the National Farmers Federation gave Labor a high score than the Coalition on their election report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Hockey is reading quotes proving the Coalition has supported Labor policies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You've got to get your facts right sweetheart! says Hockey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treasurer will withdraw that comment, Speaker Bishop says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labor asks Abbott : Why is the PM forcing Australians to choose between owning their own home or going to university?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott quotes Labor's Andrew Leigh on setting universities free with deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Hockey gets the final question and delivers slapstick demolition of the fact that Labor modelled an increase of the GST.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.08pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government question to Christopher Pyne : Will the minister explain why it's important to restore respect for the rule of law on building and construction sites in Australia and what threats exist to the government's plan for reform?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This goes to the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to know who the CFMEU is because I think many members of the public don't quite realise the kind of rogue union that we are talking about. This is a union that received a $1.5m record fine for criminal contempt of court just last year in 2014. So just thisyear in 2014 for its blockade of the Myer Emporium site. This is a union that's been found guilty of contempt of court 28times since the year 2000, with links to gangland bosses like Mick Gatto through its secretary, with links to the Comancheros and the Rebels bikie gangs. And Labor's response to this, Labor's response to this information about the CFMEU which is quite public has been to welcome it back in to the Victorian Labor Party, Pyne says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uproar ensues and Speaker Bishop picks up an unparliamentary interjection and asks for its withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Albanese eventually gets up and asks how is &quot;Kathy Jackson&quot; unparliamentary?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shorten to Abbott : Before the last election the PM promised Australians no increases to taxes. Now millions of Australians are being slugged with a GP tax, a petrol tax, and now a higher GST. Why didn't the PM tell the truth about his new taxes? Why should Australians have to pay for the PM's lies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole premise of the question is false. Fuel excise indexation is not a new tax, says Abbott.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the introduction of turnbacks for 5 months, do you know how many boats there were? None, absolutely none. Do you know how many boats turned up in the 5 months after that? One. The Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about Team Idiot. On border protection this is the captain of Team idiot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abbott says the only government that modelled an increase in the GST was Labor. Table the advice, Abbott tells Macklin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I discovered watching the news last night that members opposite, when they were in government, commissioned modelling on a rise in the GST to 12.5%. Now fair enough... Sometimes governments do commission the modelling. You own the modelling, you gave it to the media last night. Do the right thing and give it to the parliament now.</SPAN></P>

Young men with limited skills and an aggressive cast of mind have always been attracted to violence, and have often committed crimes. That those crimes are now sometimes committed in the name of Islam does not make them different from crimes committed in the name of communism or fascism, or even just due to testosterone. There is nothing unprecedented or urgent or super-risky about any of this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leyonhjelm is making the point - similar to the one made by senator Peter Whish-Wilson which caused a stir - that terrorism is in the eye of the beholder so making laws for it is tricky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It clearly hasn't occurred to the Attorney-General that some countries and societies actually make good candidates for subverting: Zimbabwe, for example, or North Korea. I'm happy to say I support the overthrow of Kim Jong-un and Robert Mugabe and I wouldn't mind if there was a bit of advocating terrorism to achieve that. What does that make me?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bill has nothing to do with defeating Da'ish in Syria or Iraq. And it will not keep us safer here in Australia. The Attorney-General says that that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Iraq and Syria is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet, 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping Communists or Fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime. These days, at least for a few, it seems violent religion provides an equivalent outlet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petrol price rise after Coalition sidesteps the senate  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mathias Cormann, the man who appears to have taken over the budget, is announcing a measure to get around the pesky senate which refuses to pass the fuel excise indexation. He is increasing the &quot;duty&quot; or tax on fuel, to make up for the lack of indexation rise - which was due to take effect two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's part of the statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has decided to give practical effect to the fuel excise indexation Budget measure by way of tariff proposals to be validated by Parliament within 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tariff proposals will be tabled in the House of Representatives this week and will take effect from 10 November 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As per the 'alcopops' precedent used by the previous government, these excise and customs tariff proposals will allow the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to collect the adjusted rate of fuel duty from that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consistent with the Budget measure, the increase in fuel excise will be modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 10 November 2014, the rate of fuel duty will increase from 38.143 cents per litre to 38.6 cents per litre, the rate which would have applied if relevant legislation had been passed by Parliament prior to 1 August 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indexation of fuel duty will then return to biannual CPI indexation from 1 February 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a typical household, which consumes 50 litres of fuel per week the estimated price impact of this fuel excise indexation will be about 40 cents per week by the end of 2014-15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I promised to come back to the Clive Palmer interview. I won't begin to pretend to understand the first point he was making on the GST. But in the second, he was trying to make the point that the GST is a regressive tax and that the government wanted to &quot;get&quot; the people under the income tax threshold to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all you have to understand that 90% of all GST collected is refunded to businesses and people like that. So if you want to raise more revenue you could just make businesses get 95% revenue and you would get more than the GST that is collected at the moment but the government won't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So GST is about taxing PAYE workers without actually allowing them to have the benefit of the (income tax) threshold so it means the poorest people in Australia can pay while business people like me get exemption and get all our money refunded to us. It's just slight of hand, a bit of magic the prime minister's got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive does a great line as the anti-politician politician. It's a tried and true formula, used by political outsiders like Pauline Hanson. Even earlier, Don Chipp promised to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;. When asked about Abbott's call for a mature debate, Palmer forgot he is a politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly Tony Abbott isn't capable of mature debate, neither is parliament really. I don't know any politicians that are capable of mature debate. When I got to parliament, I looked down one side and thought these blokes know nothing, then I looked down the other side and thought these blokes know nothing and then I looked at the public service and though these blokes know absolutely nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Treasurer Joe Hockey this morning. Photograph: Mike Bowers Guardian Australia/Mike Bowers Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, before the Murdoch speech came out, Joe Hockey took a government question in question time on the state of the global economy. He had a very similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamental challenge now for the global economy is when loose monetary policy has done its work and unfortunately made the rich richer through rising asset values but loose monetary policy has effectively been exhausted as a lever to stimulate economic growth on a global basis. Loose fiscal policy-that is, government spending hand over fist-is now limited because they do not have the money to be able to continue to do that and put it on the credit card forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that the only option for the earning of growth into the future is structural reform. That means having a more competitive world with deregulated labour markets, with barriers to increase protection put up by various countries and making sure that we undertake the domestic reforms in both our budget and the economy to build a stronger economy and ultimately deliver more jobs. That is the only way you can do it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Hockey was asked about the Murdoch prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Uhlmann asked: Joe Hockey, do you agree with Rupert Murdoch's assessment? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, certainly, as he says, loose monetary policy has helped people who own a lot of assets to become richer, and that's why loose monetary policy needs to be reversed over time, and we'll get back to normal levels of monetary policy, normal levels of interest rates. Governments, on the other hand, have also run out of money and can't keep spending money - particularly on the credit card - to try and stimulate growth. So, if loose monetary policy is not available, and actually makes the rich get richer, and governments have run out of money, how are we going to get growth going in the world economy over the next few years? And the only way to do it is through structural changes that make us better at what we do.</SPAN></P>

There was a &quot;massive shift&quot; in policies to benefit the super rich. A &quot;great global reckoning&quot; has arrived. This is a time when &quot;great leaders are fashioned&quot;.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Medicare co-payment languishes in the senate, last night the prime minister co-opted medical researches to lobby senators for the funding mechanism for the $20bn research fund announced in the budget. Tony Abbott was speaking to the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. We learnt that not only does Abbott want to be an infrastructure prime minister and a prime minister for indigenous Australia, but a prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some of you might know, when I was the health minister some years ago I regarded myself as the health minister for medical research and now I'd like to regard myself as the prime minister for medical research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he reminded the researchers, if they want their dosh, they have to start knocking on doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, the funding mechanism is controversial; we are asking for a modest co-payment from people who are visiting their general practitioner. No one likes to pay more for anything, but it seems to me that if it's fair and reasonable for people to make a modest contribution when they get their PBS drugs - the drugs that so many of you have made such a contribution towards - why isn't it also fair and reasonable for this modest contribution when you visit the doctor, particularly when for quite a few years all of the proceeds are going to be invested in what will be a world changing fund, in what will help people's lives, not just here, but right around the world? This is history making, this is culture shifting, this is life changing. So, my request to all of you in this room tonight: please don't leave tomorrow without knocking on the door of a crossbench Senator and saying, &quot;For our country's sake - for our country's sake, for the world's sake - have a look at this fund&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE World Health Organisation spent &pound;1million on a tobacco conference hosted by Vladimir Putin - while having to beg for funding to tackle the ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guests dined on caviar and drank champagne during a week-long event in Moscow, discussing tobacco control and e-cigarettes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was attended by delegates from 175 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was boycotted by the US and Canada, who withdrew after hearing that the Russian president would be hosting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news comes after Doctors Without Borders criticised the WHO earlier this month for its handling of the ebola outbreak in West Africa - particularly its lack of action on the ground. When the WHO began working with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - the three worst affected states - it was forced to plead for funding from the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mariano Lugli, deputy director of operations for Doctors Without Borders in Switzerland, who treated Ebola victims in Guinea, said he saw no sign of WHO officials during any meetings on tackling the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordination role that WHO should be playing, we just didn't see it. I didn't see it the first three weeks and we didn't see it afterwards,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After news of the conference emerged yesterday, Tory MP Philip Davies told the Sunday Express: It's quite worrying that, when we have an emerging Ebola crisis in the world WHO sees fit to waste money discussing tobacco controls.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Websites and bars have been accused of cashing in on the ebola crisis by selling hazmat suit Halloween costumes and hosting events themed around the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One costume for women which is available online - described as a sexy ebola nurse' outfit - features a face shield, goggles and gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile The Scotch of St James, a music venue in London, was criticised for planning a Halloween event called Saturday Night Ebola Fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club said the night would be used to raise money for ebola victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US nurse who says she was treated like a &quot;criminal&quot; after returning from caring for Ebola victims in west Africa has hired a leading human rights lawyer to challenge her enforced quarantine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaci Hickox, a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res (MSF) health worker, was the first person to be placed under a mandatory quarantine for volunteers who return to New York, New Jersey and Chicago after fighting the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was ordered into 21 days of isolation despite testing negative for the disease. She described the policy as a violation of her human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had spent a month watching children die, alone,&quot; she said. &quot;I had witnessed human tragedy unfold before my eyes. I had tried to help when much of the world has looked on and done nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an open letter to the Dallas Morning News in the city where she trained, she said of her treatment: &quot;I wondered what I had done wrong. I think this is an extreme that is really unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nurse, who worked in Sierra Leone, has hired the lawyer Norman Siegel to challenge the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Christie, the Governor of New Jersey, defended the quarantine rules, which are stricter than elsewhere in the US. &quot;It was my conclusion that we needed to do this to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey,&quot; he said. &quot;We have taken this action, and I have no second thoughts about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The curbs were imposed after an MSF doctor went about his business in New York for five days before discovering he had caught the disease in west Africa. Dr Craig Spencer was said to have entered a more serious stage of the illness yesterday and is being treated at a New York hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New York Times quoted an unnamed White House official who described the imposition of the mandatory quarantine order as &quot;uncoordinated, very hurried, an immediate reaction to the New York City case that doesn't comport with science.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The release of Hickox, a nurse for Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), followed pressure from the White House, sharp criticism of her treatment from mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, and the nurse's decision to recruit Norman Siegel, a renowned civil rights lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retreat by Christie, a Republican widely viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, came after he initially insisted that the quarantine was necessary to protect the people of New Jersey. He continued to claim that Hickox was &quot;obviously ill&quot; after she had tested negative for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio, who was not consulted on the state quarantine plans, said on Sunday that Hickox was a &quot;hero&quot; who had been mistreated by New Jersey. &quot;What happened to her was inappropriate,&quot; he said, during remarks at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 33-year-old nurse was confined to a tent with no shower at University Hospital in Newark. In several statements to the media over the weekend, she said that she was being made to feel like a criminal. Shortly before her release was announced, she told ABC News that she hoped &quot;this nightmare of mine and the fight that I've undertaken is not in vain&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio also criticised &quot;misstatements&quot; made about Dr Craig Spencer, who also worked for MSF, and who was diagnosed as suffering from Ebola last week. &quot;This is an incredibly noble human being,&quot; said De Blasio. Cuomo on Friday incorrectly stated that Spencer, 33, &quot;didn't follow the guidelines for the quarantine&quot;, when he was monitoring his own conditions as set out in guidelines from MSF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio urged residents to respect all medics, saying that he had received reports of Bellevue nurses being refused service at food outlets and having their children treated differently since the Ebola patient began treatment at the hospital last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the weekend, the White House made clear its concerns about the hurried reaction to the Spencer case. A White House official said that Christie and Cuomo had been warned the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of mandatory quarantines, and that the Obama administration objected to the hurried introduction of &quot;policies not grounded in science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday became the highest-ranked administration official to officially comment, telling NBC: &quot;We need to make sure [returning healthcare workers] are treated like conquering heroes and not in any other way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia on Monday announced increased monitoring of passengers arriving from west Africa through Dulles international airport outside Washington, but did not impose a mandatory quarantine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola, will be required to sign an agreement to monitor their temperature and stay at home for the duration of the disease's 21-day incubation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adherence to these procedures will be monitored daily by Virginia health officials, commissioner of health Dr Marissa Levine told reporters in a conference call on Monday, but in &quot;low-risk cases&quot; the daily contact will be via phone calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dulles is one of five airports estimated to handle over 90% of travellers arriving from west Africa, and although there are no direct flights, Levine said between two and 15 people a day arrive though Dulles from affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Monday, the CDC will require any traveler returning from the three affected west African countries to report their temperatures to their local health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be required to report every day for the 21 days following their departure from west Africa, the maximum estimated incubation period for Ebola. They will also be required to tell officials where they will be staying in the three weeks after they arrive and to hand over a list of relatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What stories have caught your interest this morning? Make your recommendations in the comments, and tomorrow we'll include (with credit, obviously) a selection in this daily post.                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;GamerGate&quot; controversy remains hugely polarising, and brands are being sucked in to the morass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably Intel and Adobe, who both faced pressure from GamerGate supporters to cut their ties with specific websites, and whose seemingly-supportive response was then attacked by critics of the virulent misogynistic side of GamerGate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now trade site AdAge has dug a little deeper into how brands are viewing the controversy, which makes for interesting reading whatever your stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if Gamergater calls for advertiser boycotts don't push marketers to withdraw ads, marketers are still seeing their in-boxes and phones exploding with rage. And with budget-planning season for 2015 underway, those publishers causing advertisers grief could easily be left off plans,&quot; it explains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article quotes one publishing sales executive complaining &quot;advertisers don't know what the fuck this is&quot; before noting the risks to brands if they take decisions over advertising without, to borrow that phrase, knowing what the f*** this is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the conundrum brands are in: Every GamerGate gripe - even if legitimate - will be linked to the vile elements of the group. So giving in is seen as siding with the worst elements of it. So far, those not responding are in better shape than those who have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is that true? Should brands be remaining above this particular fray, or should they be engaging with the debate - if not the abuse and harassment? Can brands play a role in lifting the tone of GamerGate, or do they risk fuelling its worst elements?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can advertisers pulling their spending (or threatening to) in order to sway editorial policy ever be compatible with a movement calling for &quot;ethics in games journalism&quot;? And what should Adobe and Intel be doing next, now they've got involved in GamerGate rather than not responding?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments thread is open for your thoughts. Meanwhile, here are some other technology talking points from the weekend:<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Stephen Hawking is on Facebook &gt;&gt; Facebook</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides posting his ALS ice bucket challenge, he's talking space race, pigeons and Richard Dawkins:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I greatly enjoyed the STARMUS festival. It is a combination of science and rock music, both of which I love. I was interested in the talks by the astronauts and why the Soviet Union didn't beat Neil Armstrong to the Moon. I will have to read the transcript, because I didn't understand the translation. I enjoyed hearing how Bob Wilson eliminated pigeons, they thought the microwave background was caused by pigeon droppings, and Richard Dawkins on alien life. Some people say I'm an alien myself, with my robot voice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the universe of Facebook just became a lot brighter,&quot; replied one fan, amid an outpouring of genuine affection and respect. We're looking forward to finding out what Game of Thrones cast member he is...<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">This man just sold Ebola.com for $200,000 &gt;&gt; The Verge</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timing is clearly everything in the domain speculation world. Chris Welch: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just a few weeks ago, businessman Jon Schultz was hoping to capitalize on news headlines around the globe and wanted to sell the Ebola.com domain for around $150,000. He's managed to rake in even more than that. After buying Ebola.com for $13,500 in 2008, Schultz's Blue String Ventures just flipped the domain for $200,000. According to this SEC filing, the buyer is a Russian company called Weed Growth Fund, which is paying $50,000 in cash and handing over 19,192 shares it holds in another pot-focused company, Cannabis Sativa. Those are valued at around $164,000. Based in Nevada, Cannabis Sativa is led by two-term New Mexico governor Gary Johnson and aims to grow its business by marketing marijuana products for recreational and medical use as legalization becomes more common around the world. Only a few days ago, Johnson said, &quot;We actually believe we have efficacy with regard to treating Ebola.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, at least you'll feel more relaxed about the situation. Possibly.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">The Physics of the Hendo Hoverboard</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhett Allain: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The physics for levitation is all there. You just need to work on the engineering to get a hoverboard to work.... Ok, so the physics for this type of hoverboard seems possible. Looking at other sites talking about this online, I am fairly certain it's real. One last physics note: I'm really not sure if a hoverboard powered by electromagnetic repulsion would be frictionless. I suspect there would be some type of electromagnetic drag as the coil moved over the metal surface - but I could be wrong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actual science? There's no place for that in modern crowdfunding campaigns...<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Apple's Porn Policy &gt;&gt; Medium</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Smith:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I asked how Apple was naughty, one of our developers said, &quot;they sent us a picture of a guy masturbating.&quot; Fucking what???? Apple, the company that created the iPod, Apple? &quot;Yup.&quot; It turns out Apple thought the best way to tell us our app could be used to surf porn was to surf for porn using our app. Then send us some pictures and say take a look at these! Except they said, &quot;Please see the attached screenshot for more information.&quot; So with no warning... CLICK - Well hello there handsome! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, they do say a picture tells a thousand words. Serious response: you can use Apple's own Safari app to find this kind of imagery. Slightly-more-flippant thought: If pictures of penis-in-hand men are unwanted on the App Store, has anyone warned Tinder?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Looksery Launches A Video Chatting App That Makes You Look More Attractive &gt;&gt; TechCrunch</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Perez:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Want to look more attractive on video? Or just different? Earlier this year, a company calledLooksery popped up on Kickstarter to raise crowdfunding for a new kind of mobile video chat application that allows users to look more attractive on video using special effects that can remove blemishes, let you change your eye color, slim your face, and more. The app, which is live as of today on the iTunes App Store, also lets you transform your face into an avatar for a bit of fun, too... you can chat as a panda, a gecko, a grumpy cat, a zombie, a monster or even a flaming skull. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with this sort of thing comes when you meet up IRL with the person you've been video-chatting with, and they realise your face isn't what it seemed. &quot;You're not even a TINY bit like a panda!&quot;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Over to you...</SPAN><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">761 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Civil Society Council has raised four-count issues with recommendations to the National Elections Commission (NEC) over the holding of the special senatorial elections amidst the Ebola pandemic in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter addressed to the Chairperson, Jerome Korkoyah, the Council reported that its reservations were tendered at a consultative discussion last Monday with the Elections Coordinating Committee (ECC) and other members of civil society organization where among other things, the issue of mitigating the further spread of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during electoral activities and the election timetable were cardinal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conglomeration of civil society organizations said it resolves to support the holding of the Special Senatorial Election should the NEC modifies the campaign format that will rule out mass political rallies and movements of people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of election timetable, the Civil Society Council said the December 16 date set is unrealistic giving the huge logistical and technical preparations including recruiting and training of election workers, required to conduct a credible and transparent election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is however proposing that the election be held on December 30, 2014. &quot;This we believe will give the NEC an additional two weeks to deal with any unforeseen problem affecting the conduct of the election and still have enough time to deal with any legal challenges emerging from the conduct of the election,&quot; the CSOs suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also informed NEC that civil society groups will also need adequate time to train and work with the 2,000 observers across the country because considering maximizing time, resources and avoiding voter apathy, the NEC should be mindful that the election covers the entire 15 political subdivisions rather than selected counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the issue of timetable, the civil society council recommended that there should be huge logistical and technical preparations including recruiting and training of election workers, required to conduct a credible and transparent election as well as adequate time to train and work with observers across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues that comprised of the four-count resolution, the Civil Society Organizations' reservation were also targeted at voters' apathy to participate in the election adding that presently the concern of the population is directed to ending the Ebola disease from further outbreak, seeking livelihood and hoping that academic activities resume as well as the reopening of health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council said the population interested in voting may not be high as expected because it is not a priority and recommended that there be a partnership with Civil Society Organizations to reach out and explain why the election did not take place on October 14 as required by the Constitution and why it is important and necessary to participate in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of congestion on the day of election, the group's reservation is that polling centers are usually crowd-congested and a risk factor in the spread of the EBOLA virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group resolved that the NEC increases the number of polling centers at polling precincts across the country which might reduce the number of persons queuing at a given time to cast their ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also think that where possible, some polling precincts be located in open spaces such as government administrative buildings and football stadium or gymnasium. These should be reinforced by other safety measures to reduce any further risk of spreading the virus and accompanied by mass public education on what these measures will be,&quot; it concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When contacted yesterday, the NEC Public Relations Officer, Joey Kennedy, said the Commission has been holding consultations with various groups for the successful holding of the senatorial election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confirmed that although NEC has proposed December 16 in keeping with the resolution passed by the National Legislature, the Commission is still holding consultations with the intent of gathering more suggestions and information surrounding the conduct of elections at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC consultations will continue today in Zwedru City with stakeholders from Grand Kru, River Gee, Maryland and Grand Gedeh Counties as well as stakeholders from Bong, Nimba and Lofa who are converging in Gbarnga City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stakeholders from Gbarpolu, Bomi, Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount Counties have already met in Tubmanburg City and, also stakeholders from Margibi, Grand Bassa, River Cess and Sinoe concluded meeting in Buchanan City over the weekend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Female Journalist Association of Liberia (FeJAL) yesterday donated assorted items to the Ebola Treatment Unit at the Island Clinic for Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the assorted items, FeJAL's Coordinator, Tonwon Sulanteh Brown said FeJAL thought it wise to join the Government of Liberia and its partners in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus because the Government can not fight this disease alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Brown said that it's FeJAL's prayer that the Ebola virus will be contained and that Liberia and Liberians will be free again. She praised the health workers at the clinic saying that they are heroes and heroines because they are the ones at the front fighting this toxic disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She mentioned that as journalists inform the public about the danger of the virus they are also informing the public about the good work health workers are doing. According to her, survivors' stories have been told to the public by the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the assorted items, the Liberian doctor at Island Clinic, Dr. Williamatta Williams-Gibson thanked FeJAL and said that she and her staffs are grateful for the donation. She stressed that the patients are also grateful because they need more fluid in their body to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She praised FeJAL saying that she is glad that they are not only informing the public about the preventive measures that one needs to take but that they are also caring for those who are infected with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gibson said the patients eat three times a day and that they are well taken care of at the Ebola Treatment Center. Looking at the team she said she was happy to meet credible journalists who are doing all they could to inform the public about the fight against the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the turning over occasion on Saturday at the Barclay Training Center, outgoing Commander Williams expressed gratitude to those he had worked with in strengthening the Military-to-Military operations especially Defense Minister Brownie Samukai, U.S Ambassador Deborah Malac, Liberia's Chief of Staff Daniel Ziankahn, the US-CDC and USAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Williams as he turned over responsibility in the mission, he said that he understands that there is still much to be done and believes that there is no other better unit to carry on the task beside the 101stAirborne Division led by Volesky which is leading one of the highly decorated units in the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am proud of everything US Africa Command and the Joint Force of the United States Assistance have done; the USAID cooperation and the 101st will build on this foundation. My short time here I see that the US and Liberia share a special bond; there is no fight in this world more worthy of fighting than the one here in Liberia,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new commander of the operation, Volesky said he had only been in the country for five days and is easy to see the progress even though there is a daunting task that must be accomplished together noting that he believes in demonstrating with action and not words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volesky said to prove that he is prepared for action; he has thousands of his soldiers arriving already in the country and ready to join the great team to fight Ebola together thereby thanking the Minister of National Defense for allowing the U.S troops to squat on the military facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he promised to continue to build on the foundation established by General Williams and his team of foot soldiers, Major General Volesky said he had been told by a number of persons that the task he has assumed is extremely difficult but reminded that the 'hard is not impossible'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volesky said he is sure that the task is not difficult because he is determined to see Liberians get on to a brighter future and their resilience to stopping the spread of the disease. Outgone Commander, Williams with Master of Art in Leadership Development served as deputy commanding general for support, 2nd Infantry Division Republic of Korea and most recently served as Deputy Chief of Staff G3/5/7, USAREUR in Wiesbaden.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 101st Airborne Division (air assault) provides the U.S. an unmatched expeditionary Air Assault capability to conduct forcible entry and other worldwide unified land operations in support of combatant commanders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The People's Republic of China yesterday brought into the country more than US$82m worth of materials to strengthen the global efforts in combating the Ebola virus. The materials included several building materials for the construction of additional Ebola Treatment Units around the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Roberts International Airport where three chattered Boeing 747 cargo planes landed, Chinese Ambassador ZANG Yue said the consignments which included hospital beds, ambulances, motorcycles, Personal Protective Equipment and other urgently needed supplies to soon follow are intended for the three Ebola hit countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said that China will also dispatch advisory groups consisting of public health experts who will share China's experiences and help improve the prevention and control plans of the affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ambassador ZANG Yue, the donation formed part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's earlier pronouncement made on October 24 this year that China was to provide at least $500m RMB Yuan, which is around US$ 82m as an assistance package to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to partnership with International Organizations' fight against the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He intimated that this is the fourth round of China's gesture to African countries, and will serve as the largest of China's assistance program's packaged for Ebola-affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador ZANG Yue further stated that in addition to the medical supplies, the Chinese Government will beef up the efforts of UNMIL with an amount of US$6m as part of its International commitments made to assist the United Nations in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Government of China will build additional ETU's to add to the already existing ones in the country and also send advanced team of 15 persons, comprising of Medical Doctors, epidemiologists, designers, engineers and technicians to assist the Government and International partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador ZANG Yue stated further that the advance of persons will mainly be responsible with the construction of the ETU's, exchanging views with both local officials and International partners and experts of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the donation on behalf of government, Deputy Minister, Sylvester Grigsby of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lauded the Peoples and Government of China for the gesture and their continuous support to Liberia and Africa as a whole. The assistance package is expected to be completely delivered between October 26 and 29 respectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">617 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOFA COUNTY, THE epicenter of the vicious Ebola virus is expected to be Ebola-free soon with just six remaining cases at the largest Ebola Treatment Center (ETU) in Foya, Lofa County. However, MSF has warned of cross-border activities as the virus has reached its highest peak in neighboring Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRESIDENT ELLEN-JOHNSON-SIRLEAF who visited several health facilities in the county was informed by health workers in the county that the rate of Ebola has significantly decreased with just six recorded cases at the ETU in Lofa County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SERGE ST. LOUIS, MSF Project Coordinator in Lofa disclosed that there have been no new cases in the past three weeks. He said there were ten patients at the ETU in the entire Lofa County over the past three weeks but has decreased to only six since Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOWEVER, ST. LOUIS has warned of cross-border activities calling on government to be vigilant as the Ebola virus has reached its highest peak along the Liberian-Guinean border. Report says Massanta and Geikaydou near the Liberian border are the highest hit towns in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LATEST REPORT SUGGESTS that Ebola is raging in Gaikaydou and Massanta close to the Liberian border, hence health observers say for Lofa to be completely clear of the deadly Ebola virus, Liberia's borders must remain closed with other affected neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DECREASE IN the rate of Ebola in Lofa County, the epicenter of the deadly virus is indeed a welcoming news something that is worth emulating. Just a month back, Lofa County recorded the highest rate of Ebola deaths with no sign of reduction in the spread of the virus. As a result the virus overwhelmed Lofa and the entire county thus creating fear in the minds of Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT LATEST NEWS emanating from the northern county suggests that the virus has significantly decreased in the county with just six reported cases of Ebola at the largest ETU in Foya. This, we think is due to the efforts being applied by the county health authorities and the citizens themselves who are taking every necessary preventive measures to eradicate the vicious disease in their county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH THIS LATEST development in Lofa, we are calling on other counties to emulate the good example of Lofa by applying every necessary measure in ensuring that the virus is eradicated in our country. Ebola can be kicked out of Liberia by applying all the health measures by the citizens themselves in the remaining counties to stop further spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE BELIEVE THAT if all of the measures are taken as being done in Lofa County, Liberia will be free of the deadly virus in a month or two months time. Let us stop touching dead bodies or people who are acutely sick, let's continue to wash our hands regularly and follow other preventive measures as being done by the citizens of Lofa County if we are to join that county in kicking out Ebola from the rest of the counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON THE OTHER hand, while we appreciate the fact that the spread of the virus has subsided in Lofa and other counties, we are calling on the Government of Liberia to ensure that Liberia's borders with neighboring countries affected by Ebola be tightened to avoid further spread of the virus in that county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOFA HAS DONE well in the fight against the virus and so we expect other counties to follow the good example of the county by ensuring that all of the preventive measures are followed to the letter. If that is done, Ebola will be a history in our country in the shortest possible time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LET US KICK Ebola out of Liberia by emulating the good example of Lofa County, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak that is now becoming Ebola-free. This can only be done if we are willing to prevent ourselves against the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been cases in three other West African countries, Spain and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN health agency said yesterday the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases has risen to 10,141, with about 200 new cases since the last report, four days ago. But even those figures are likely to be an underestimate, the WHO has warned, as many in the hardest hit countries have been unable, or too frightened, to seek medical care. A shortage of labs capable of handling potentially infected blood samples has also made the virus hard to track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as authorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country's first ebola patient, a two-year-old girl who had arrived from Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the governors of New Jersey and New York have ordered a mandatory, 21-day quarantine of all medical workers and other arriving airline passengers who have had contact with victims in West Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Blango turned down an offer of compassionate leave after he told Navy top brass of the deaths.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naval airman Blango said: This is personal now and the deaths in my family have made me even more determined to help people suffering with ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even my commander asked me not to go because of my family circumstances but I still wanted to go and help. I am proud to do my part and to contribute to the vital humanitarian work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was aware of the ebola situation in Sierra Leone but it never occurred to me it would affect my own family. I was prepared to go before I knew that my family was involved but knowing that has made me even more determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just want to help, not only because of my family, although that has made me more passionate.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told his father: Somebody has got to do something about it and I'm very pleased we have decided to provide aid. Sierra Leone does not have the infrastructure needed to cope and it would be a disaster for the country if we didn't help. It is an honour for me to play a part.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blango joined the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) in 2009 after obtaining an engineering degree from the University of Greenwich. He is currently sailing to Sierra Leone aboard British hospital ship RFA Argus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His job on board is to service and maintain three Merlin helicopters which, once the vessel arrives off the coast of the country's capital Freetown this week, will deliver food and medical supplies to remote areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blango was able to speak to his parents from Gibraltar last week while the ship docked to allow vehicles to be driven aboard. He told his father, Columba, that he was in a good mood after being granted shore leave and finding a McDonald's restaurant near the docks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night 58-year-old Columba Blango, a former Mayor of Southwark, in South East London, said: Christian joined the Royal Navy for the purpose of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He loves it and he knows he is doing the right thing now, and he considered it his duty to serve his nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother and I are very proud of him. When we've spoken to him we've tried not to ask him too much about his ebola mission but he seems very positive about what he's doing. After the terrible family news I was surprised he was emotionally ready to go but he is and I am encouraging him every step of the way.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Blango was born and raised in Britain but visited his extended family in Sierra Leone as a 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 11, three of his cousins living in the village of Moyamba Junction, situated 100 miles east of Freetown, began displaying symptoms of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day rescue workers from the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres took swabs which led to them being diagnosed with ebola. They subsequently died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then on September 17, two more cousins were diagnosed and later lost their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then a further nine of his cousins have contracted ebola. Of these, three have died and six are receiving medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 28,000-ton RFA Argus set sail for Sierra Leone ten days ago. Once she arrives, she is likely to spend up to six months there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN AMERICAN doctor who tested positive for the Ebola virus in New York passed through enhanced safety checks at JFK airport and lived in the city for more than seven days before being diagnosed with the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities in New York have begun trying to piece together the movements of Craig Spencer, a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res doctor who is believed to have contracted the virus while working in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Spencer contacted New York's health authorities when he started showing symptoms, including a temperature of 100.3F (37.9C) after his return, and was taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, the city's designated Ebola centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Spencer's 30-year-old fianc&eacute;e, Morgan Dixon, and two friends have been placed in a 21-day quarantine as a precaution. Authorities are now tracking his travel on the city's subway through his MetroCard travel pass and will also use his credit card records to track shops and restaurants he visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill de Blasio, the mayor, and Andrew Cuomo, the state governor, sought yesterday to reassure eight million New Yorkers that they were not at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr de Blasio said: &quot;Being on the same subway car or living near someone with Ebola does not in itself put someone at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Dallas nurse who was the first person to contract Ebola in the US has recovered. Nina Pham, 26, became infected earlier this month while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed with the disease on US soil.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASTRAZENECA was in the spotlight amid speculation an $11bn (&pound;6.8bn) share buyback by its former suitor, Pfizer, signalled the American company will not renew its pursuit of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors have been hoping the US group will revive its bid approach for the FTSE 100 company when Takeover Panel restrictions are lifted next month. Inevitably, then, the market's knee-jerk reaction yesterday to Pfizer's cash return announcement sent Astra shares down as much as 93p, on the assumption a takeover was not under consideration. But the stock rebounded after analysts at Citigroup told clients a deal was not off the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buy-back has &quot;zero significance&quot; as to whether Pfizer will make a fresh offer for Astra, the Citi experts said, adding that there remains a &quot;high probability&quot; that the US company will bid again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repurchases can be halted &quot;at any time&quot; and Pfizer could also finance an Astra bid while the buy-back is ongoing, the analysts concluded, repeating their belief that the recent US Treasury crackdown on tax inversion takeovers would only have a limited impact on any potential deal. The reassuring message from Citi, combined with news the European Union regulator had given Astra's Olaparib ovarian cancer drug its backing, helped the drugmaker's shares stage a partial recovery and close down just 7p at &pound;43.27&frac12;. The FTSE 100 fell 30.42 points, or 0.5pc, to 6,388.73 as investors reacted to news of the first Ebola case in New York. Nervousness ahead of the European bank stress test results on Sunday also weighed on the index.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travel shares were hurt by the renewed Ebola worries. InterContinental Hotels slid 43p to &pound;22.17 and cruise operator Carnival declined as much as 36p before closing down 3p at to &pound;23.49.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BT Group lost 6.6p to 370p after Morgan Stanley analysts stoked concern that its broadband rivals are gaining ground. There is also the risk BT could agree to pay &pound;1bn a year for the television rights to the Premier League at the next auction, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TalkTalk, which was lifted by market bid speculation a day earlier, was knocked back down again by Nomura analysts, who told clients they were &quot;increasingly concerned&quot; the broadband provider &quot;would not be able to maintain the earnings momentum required to justify its valuation premium&quot;. The shares closed 5.1p lower at 286.4p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearson slumped 30p to &pound;11.39 on news its finance chief was stepping down after a decade at the education publisher. A trading update also unsettled investors, with Liberum saying the wording of the statement suggested Pearson was &quot;preparing the market&quot; for a downgrade to 2015 estimates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has criticized her treatment under a mandatory 21-day quarantine policy implemented in three US states on Friday, in an article written in a New Jersey hospital where she remained in isolation on Saturday despite testing negative for Ebola in a preliminary test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaci Hickox was placed in isolation under a policy announced on Friday by New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, which requires anyone flying into the states after having contact with Ebola sufferers in west Africa to be subject to a mandatory 21-day quarantine, thought to be the disease's maximum incubation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Saturday, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Cuomo had not informed city officials before announcing the new quarantine rules. De Blasio declined to criticize or commend the new rules, which also affect New Jersey, but told reporters the city would co-operate with them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governors of New York and New Jersey acted after a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who worked with Ebola patients in Guinea, tested positive for the disease. He remained in stable condition at Bellevue hospital in New York on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois department of public health has imposed similar restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,&quot; Illinois governor Pat Quinn said in a statement. &quot;We must take every step necessary to ensure the people of Illinois are protected from potential exposure to the Ebola virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Saturday, Barack Obama used his presidential address to urge Americans to base their response to domestic Ebola cases on &quot;facts, not fear&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox, meanwhile, in a first-person account published by the Dallas Morning News, wrote: &quot;I have been quarantined in New Jersey. This is not a situation I would wish on anyone, and I am scared for those who will follow me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox, a volunteer nurse with Doctors Without Borders, was stopped at Newark airport in New Jersey. Upon arriving at the airport, she told an immigration official she had travelled from Sierra Leone. She endured several hours of questioning from officials wearing protective coveralls, gloves, masks and face shields. Her temperature was taken, and recorded at 98F. Then, she said, her temperature was taken a second time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four hours after I landed at the airport, an official approached me with a forehead scanner. My cheeks were flushed, I was upset at being held with no explanation. The scanner recorded my temperature as 101.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hickox said she was left alone in a room for another three hours before being taken to the hospital, where her temperature was again recorded. This time it was 98.6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sat alone in the isolation tent and thought of many colleagues who will return home to America and face the same ordeal,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Jersey department of health said Hickox will remain in isolation for the time being. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil liberties activists, meanwhile, raised concerns about the constitutionality of the new rules, warning they could discourage health workers from volunteering to fight Ebola in Africa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid groups have also expressed concern that the mandatory quarantine could dissuade healthcare workers from going to the region, which desperately needs more doctors and nurses to fight the virus, which the World Health Organisation said on Saturday has now infected more than 10,000 people. Almost 5,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, have died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were signs that top health officials in New York City were also taken by surprise by the tough new rules, which go beyond recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventon (CDC), the agency managing the federal response to Ebola in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC said in a statement that it &quot;sets the baseline recommended standards, but state and local officials have the prerogative to tighten the regimen as they see fit&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday night Mary Bassett, New York City's health commissioner, sounded a cautious note. &quot;People who go and volunteer, we have to look at how the new quarantine policy would impact them,&quot; she said on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an earlier press conference, she praised Spencer's actions in volunteering to help Ebola victims in west Africa and said he had followed protocols on his return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's this young guy who went over there, really doing the right thing, the courageous thing, and he handled himself really well,&quot; Bassett said. &quot;I don't want anyone portraying him as reckless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor of New York, Bill De Blasio, told a press conference earlier on Friday that American medical professionals helping to tackle the outbreak in west Africa &quot;are the people who will end this crisis&quot;. He said: &quot;We have to make sure that that flow of medical personnel can continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked only a few hours before the state quarantine was announced whether such a policy was necessary, De Blasio said: &quot;I think at this point the pieces we have put in play are the right ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), has warned against a mandatory quarantine on medics returning from Ebola-stricken countries, saying it would be an &quot;excessive measure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Civil Liberties Union also expressed concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand the importance of protecting the public from an Ebola outbreak,&quot; the ACLU said in a statement reported by the New York Times, adding that the mandatory orders for isolation &quot;raise serious constitutional concerns about the state abusing its police powers by detaining people who are exhibiting no Ebola symptoms&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration is understood to be considering the effectiveness of imposing a nationwide policy of quarantining health workers returning from west Africa. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined to rule it out during a briefing on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told Reuters: &quot;There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are returning to the United States from affected countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer finished his work in Guinea on 12 October and left the country on 14 October, flying home to John F Kennedy airport in New York via Europe. He arrived in New York on 17 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Guidelines set out by MSF state that returning medics should stay within four hours of a hospital with isolation facilities, but do not require that they avoid crowds, so long as they do not display symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as a returned staff member does not experience any symptoms, normal life can proceed,&quot; the organisation says. &quot;Family, friends, and neighbors can be assured that a returned staff person who does not present symptoms is not contagious and does not put them at risk. Self-quarantine is neither warranted nor recommended when a person is not displaying Ebola-like symptoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Obama urged calm. &quot;We have to be guided by the science - we have to be guided by the facts, not fear,&quot; the president said in his weekly address to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, New Yorkers showed us the way. They did what they do every day - jumping on buses, riding the subway, crowding into elevators, heading into work, gathering in parks. That spirit - that determination to carry on - is part of what makes New York one of the great cities in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that's the spirit all of us can draw upon, as Americans, as we meet this challenge together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second week in a row Obama has used his address to urge a calm response to domestic Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conspicuous attempt to allay public fear, on Friday Obama was photographed hugging Nina Pham, the first of two Texas nurses to recover from the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died in Dallas earlier this month. Pham returned home shortly before midnight on Friday, accompanied by her mother and sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer worked in Guinea for MSF before coming down with a fever about a week after he arrived in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press spoke to two healthcare workers at the MSF treatment center where Spencer worked in Gueckedou, in southeastern Guinea. They said they were frightened to learn their colleague had contracted the disease and told the AP, under the condition of anonymity, that hospital staff was taking extra care to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the discovery of the latest Ebola case in New York, the CDC had tightened its monitoring requirements for travellers arriving in the US from the three west African countries hardest hit by the outbreak. The new monitoring system goes into effect on Monday in six states - New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia - and will eventually be expanded across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new guidelines will require anyone who flies from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea &shy;- regardless of whether they are exhibiting symptoms &shy;- to check in daily with state and local health officials to report their temperatures and the presence of Ebola-like symptoms, if any, such as severe headaches, fatigue and diarrhoea. Travellers will also be required to coordinate with health officials if they need, or want, to travel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a traveller doesn't check in, the CDC said health officials would take immediate action to track the person down and ensure the proper monitoring is carried out. Concern has been raised over the feasibility of such proposed action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama urged Americans to base their response to domestic Ebola cases on &quot;facts, not fear&quot; on Saturday, as signs of a rift emerged between city and state officials over the handling of the diagnosis of the virus in a doctor from New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Jersey, a health worker returning from west Africa, stopped at Newark airport under a new policy hurriedly put in place by that state and New York, remained in hospital quarantine on Saturday despite testing negative in a preliminary test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil liberties activists, meanwhile, raised concerns about the constitutionality of the new rules, warning they could discourage health workers from volunteering to fight Ebola in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The introduction of tougher quarantine rules came as officials scrambled to calm public fears in response to news that a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who worked with Ebola patients in Guinea, had tested positive for the disease. He remained in a stable condition at Bellevue hospital in New York on Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman stopped at Newark airport showed no symptoms of the virus when she arrived on Friday but later developed a fever. She will remain in isolation at University Hospital in Newark for the time being, the New Jersey department of health said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unnamed woman was placed in isolation under a policy, announced on Friday by New Jersey governor Chris Christie and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, which requires anyone flying into the states after having contact with Ebola sufferers in west Africa to be subject to a mandatory 21-day quarantine, thought to be the disease's maximum incubation period. Officials said the woman had contact with Ebola patients in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid groups have expressed concern that the mandatory quarantine could dissuade healthcare workers from going to the region, which desperately needs more doctors and nurses to fight the virus, which the World Health Organisation said on Saturday has now infected more than 10,000 people. Almost 5,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were signs that top health officials in New York City were taken by surprise by the tough new rules, which go beyond recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventon (CDC), the agency managing the federal response to Ebola in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois department of public health has imposed similar restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,&quot; Illinois governor Pat Quinn said in a statement. &quot;We must take every step necessary to ensure the people of Illinois are protected from potential exposure to the Ebola virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois has not had a confirmed case of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC said in a statement that it &quot;sets the baseline recommended standards, but state and local officials have the prerogative to tighten the regimen as they see fit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Bassett, New York City's health commissioner, sounded a cautious note on Friday night. &quot;People who go and volunteer, we have to look at how the new quarantine policy would impact them,&quot; she said on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an earlier press conference, she praised Spencer's actions in volunteering to help Ebola victims in west Africa and said he had followed protocols on his return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's this young guy who went over there, really doing the right thing, the courageous thing, and he handled himself really well,&quot; Bassett said. &quot;I don't want anyone portraying him as reckless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor of New York, Bill De Blasio, told a press conference earlier on Friday that American medical professionals helping to tackle the outbreak in west Africa &quot;are the people who will end this crisis&quot;. He said: &quot;We have to make sure that that flow of medical personnel can continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked only a few hours before the state quarantine was announced whether such a policy was necessary, De Blasio said: &quot;I think at this point the pieces we have put in play are the right ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), has warned against a mandatory quarantine on medics returning from Ebola-stricken countries, saying it would be an &quot;excessive measure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Civil Liberties Union also expressed concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand the importance of protecting the public from an Ebola outbreak,&quot; it said in a statement reported by the New York Times, adding that the mandatory orders for isolation &quot;raise serious constitutional concerns about the state abusing its police powers by detaining people who are exhibiting no Ebola symptoms&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration is understood to be considering the effectiveness of imposing a nationwide policy of quarantining health workers returning from west Africa. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined to rule it out during a briefing on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told Reuters: &quot;There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are returning to the United States from affected countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer finished his work in Guinea on 12 October and left the country on 14 October, flying home to John F Kennedy airport in New York via Europe. He arrived in New York on 17 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Guidelines set out by MSF state that returning medics should stay within four hours of a hospital with isolation facilities, but do not require that they avoid crowds, so long as they do not display symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as a returned staff member does not experience any symptoms, normal life can proceed,&quot; the organisation says. &quot;Family, friends, and neighbors can be assured that a returned staff person who does not present symptoms is not contagious and does not put them at risk. Self-quarantine is neither warranted nor recommended when a person is not displaying Ebola-like symptoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Obama urged calm. &quot;We have to be guided by the science - we have to be guided by the facts, not fear,&quot; the president said in his weekly address to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yesterday, New Yorkers showed us the way. They did what they do every day - jumping on buses, riding the subway, crowding into elevators, heading into work, gathering in parks. That spirit - that determination to carry on - is part of what makes New York one of the great cities in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And that's the spirit all of us can draw upon, as Americans, as we meet this challenge together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second week in a row Obama has used his address to urge a calm response to domestic Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conspicuous attempt to allay public fear, on Friday Obama was photographed hugging Nina Pham, the first of two Texas nurses to recover from the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and died in Dallas earlier this month. Pham returned home shortly before midnight on Friday, accompanied by her mother and sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer worked in Guinea for MSF before coming down with a fever about a week after he arrived in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press spoke to two healthcare workers at the MSF treatment center where Spencer worked in Gueckedou, in southeastern Guinea. They said they were frightened to learn their colleague had contracted the disease and told the AP, under the condition of anonymity, that hospital staff was taking extra care to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the discovery of the latest Ebola case in New York, the CDC had tightened its monitoring requirements for travellers arriving in the US from the three west African countries hardest hit by the outbreak. The new monitoring system goes into effect on Monday in six states - New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia - and will eventually be expanded across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new guidelines will require anyone who flies from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea &shy;- regardless of whether they are exhibiting symptoms &shy;- to check in daily with state and local health officials to report their temperatures and the presence of Ebola-like symptoms, if any, such as severe headaches, fatigue and diarrhoea. Travellers will also be required to coordinate with health officials if they need, or want, to travel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a traveller doesn't check in, the CDC said health officials would take immediate action to track the person down and ensure the proper monitoring is carried out. Concern has been raised over the feasibility of such proposed action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, who has not been identified, will remain in isolation at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, the state department of health said.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who have Ebola are not contagious until they develop symptoms. The disease, which has now killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is transmitted to other people through bodily fluids. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone flying into New York and New Jersey after having contact with Ebola sufferers in west Africa will be subjected to a mandatory 21-day quarantine, the governors of the two states announced on Friday, adding that one returning medic had already been detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey unveiled the joint policy, which goes beyond federal rules set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as officials indicated the Obama administration was considering a similar rule throughout the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governors acted after the hospitalisation in New York of Craig Spencer, a 33-year-old doctor who was infected with the virus while treating patients in Guinea, one of the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid charities had previously warned that a quarantine rule would deter American doctors from travelling to Africa to help tackle the Ebola crisis. Yet the governors told a press conference in New York on Friday afternoon that they were unsatisfied with a self-monitoring system that had allowed Spencer to travel around crowded parts of the city such as the subway system, a restaurant and a bowling alley, after being infected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, said: &quot;We're just not comfortable with the concept of voluntary quarantine as an effective public health security measure.&quot; He stressed that the CDC had made clear states were entitled to set tougher rules of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, said he was prepared to take &quot;whatever steps were necessary to ensure the public health&quot; amid the ongoing risk of Ebola. &quot;New Jersey and New York are going to determine the standards of quarantine, since CDC's guidance is continually changing,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to set a standard for our two states.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quarantine rule is expected to apply to anyone, including healthcare workers, who came into contact with people infected with Ebola in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone. All travellers entering the two states through Newark and JFK international airports after being in the countries suffering from Ebola outbreaks will have their health monitored by state authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie said that a woman not showing any symptoms of an Ebola infection was quarantined at Newark airport earlier on Friday. Christie said that the woman was a healthcare worker who had been treating patients with Ebola and had travelled to the US from Sierra Leone. She was said to have been heading for New York via the New Jersey airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether authorities held concerns about the woman's health, Christie said: &quot;None that I'm currently aware of.&quot; Asked where exactly inside the airport the woman was being held, the governor told reporters that he did not know, adding: &quot;Not in the United lounge&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement by Cuomo and Christie appeared to take senior New York City officials, who have been overseeing the treatment of Spencer, by surprise. The mayor of New York, Bill De Blasio, told a press conference earlier on Friday that American medical professionals helping to tackle the outbreak in west Africa &quot;are the people who will end this crisis&quot;. He said: &quot;We have to make sure that that flow of medical personnel can continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked only a few hours before the state quarantine was announced whether such a policy was necessary, De Blasio said: &quot;I think at this point the pieces we have put in play are the right ones&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, which Spencer had been working for in Guinea, said earlier on Friday that a quarantine on medics returning from Ebola-stricken countries would be an &quot;excessive measure&quot;. A spokesman for the organisation, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), did not immediately return a request for comment on the New York-New Jersey policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid calls for tougher action from Obama, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, declined during a briefing on Friday to rule out a nationwide quarantine program for returning healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told Reuters that a nationwide quarantine was indeed one option being discussed by administration officials. &quot;There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are returning to the United States from affected countries,&quot; Skinner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer had finished his work in Guinea on 12 October and left the country on 14 October, flying home to John F Kennedy airport in New York via Europe. He arrived in New York on 17 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Guidelines set out by MSF state that returning medics should stay within four hours of a hospital with isolation facilities, but do not require that they avoid crowds, so long as they do not display symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as a returned staff member does not experience any symptoms, normal life can proceed,&quot; the organisation says. &quot;Family, friends, and neighbors can be assured that a returned staff person who does not present symptoms is not contagious and does not put them at risk. Self-quarantine is neither warranted nor recommended when a person is not displaying Ebola-like symptoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials offered more details about Spencer's recent movements in New York. On Tuesday, he visited the High Line park where he stopped at the Blue Bottle coffee stand, and ate at the Greenwich Avenue branch of the Meatball Shop restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, he took a three-mile jog on Riverside Drive, near his home, rode the subway to the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn and took an Uber cab home, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders immediately, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for Ebola patients, under strictly controlled conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials said that Spencer declared a fever of 100.3F (38C), not the 103F originally reported. The mistake in the announcemnet was made because of a transcription error, they said, stressing that the lower-grade fever made it even less likely that New Yorkers would have been at risk from Spencer in the previous few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Bassett, the city health commissioner, said that Spencer was in a stable condition in an isolation unit at Bellevue, where he was taken in an ambulance my fully protected medical teams on Thursday. Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, and two of their friends, are in a 21-day quarantine. They are not permitted to leave the undisclosed location where they are staying and will have their health monitored twice daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bassett said Spencer was in a stable condition at Bellevue, where doctors were considering whether to offer any of the experimental treatments that have been tried on other Ebola patients in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a privately contracted crew of environmental and hazardous material cleaners arrived at the apartment that Spencer shared with his fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio urged New Yorkers not to be concerned. &quot;There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way,&quot; he said, stressing that Ebola is very difficult to contract. &quot;It cannot be transmitted through casual contact, it cannot be transmitted through an airborne fashion,&quot; De Blasio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Spencer's apartment in Harlem, the area's city councilman Mark Levine was on the scene to try to reassure neighbours that they were safe. &quot;There's a lot of misconception out there, and people are scared understandably,&quot; he said. &quot;But they have to understand that you don't catch this by walking by someone or sitting next to them on the subway or jogging by them in the park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were unconvinced. &quot;This entire neighbourhood is worried,&quot; said Stan Malone, who said he lived across West 147th Street from Spencer. &quot;People want to know why they haven't quarantined his entire building yet. Ebola is here in the city and you can bet this won't be the last case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID CAMERON last night rounded on the leaders of 18 European nations that have each donated less to the fight against Ebola than Ikea, the Swedish furniture chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to shame European leaders into action, the Prime Minister used a dinner at the European Council last night to announce he was increasing Britain's aid to west Africa by &pound;80million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid mounting anger in Downing Street at Europe's refusal to take the crisis seriously, the Prime Minister warned his counterparts that their economies are imperilled by their refusal to respond to the emergency at source before the disease spreads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that Britain's contribution to the crisis so far - &pound;125million - is more than the combined total of 19 of Europe's 28 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasing that total to &pound;205million means Britain is shouldering the lion's share of the European fund to fight the virus. Mr Cameron has set a target of &pound;800 million for all of Europe, of which &pound;670 million has so far been pledged. If the target is hit, Britain could be prepared to increase its contribution further, government sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Prime Minister indicated his frustration over the response to Ebola as he fights an attempt by the European Parliament to hike the EU's budget by &pound;5.4billion, in defiance of his call for cuts. Brussels must be &quot;ruthless&quot; with taxpayers' money and &quot;prioritise&quot; at a time when families are cutting back, he believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extra British money for Ebola will fund 200 field hospitals to treat Ebola in remote areas of Sierra Leone. Some &pound;10million will be spent on the safe burial of bodies, as traditional funerals are a significant factor in the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikea has given &pound;3.9million to Ebola aid funds during the crisis. Mr Cameron told the leaders over dinner that is more than the sums pledged by countries including Austria, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is apparent that some countries &quot;obviously don't feel massive ties&quot; to Africa, a Government source said. Sierra Leone is a former British colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Cameron told his counterparts to be &quot;really clear about the risks&quot; that Ebola posed as the &quot;biggest public health emergency we face&quot;. He warned that the &quot;crisis&quot; of Ebola must urgently be tackled &quot;at source&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Cameron was also last night expected to issue an especially withering rebuke to Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, whose country saw the first transmission of Ebola in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's interesting to see a case like Spain, that has seen the stark realities of dealing with Ebola, yet we are contributing 50 times more than Spain. It's for countries to reflect on what they can be spending,&quot; said a source. Meanwhile, a British-American cameramancured of Ebola has been released from hospital but said he has &quot;a heavy feeling&quot; knowing thousands of other sufferers are languishing without care in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ashoka Mukpo, 33, said it was painful to know he received state-of-the-art treatment in Nebraska while people in Liberia were dying. &quot;It's a heavy feeling,&quot; he told NBC News. &quot;I don't know if guilt is the right word. But just feels like something isn't right about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Mupko spoke for the first time as US scientists warn today that the epidemic is likely to explode by the middle of December in west Africa. As many as 171,000 fatalities are possible in Liberia alone by Dec 15, the Yale University-led team warned, representing 12 per cent of the country's population. Mali last night said it had detected its first case of Ebola, making it the sixth West African country to be touched by the deadly haemorrhagic fever. A two-year-old girl who had recently arrived from neighbouring Guinea, where the outbreak began, tested positive. An American doctor who was treating Ebola patients in Africa has been rushed to a hospital in New York City after reportedly developing symptoms consistent with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Craig Spencer, 33, who returned to the US 10 days ago from Guinea, is being tested at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the unexpected lessons from the Ebola cases in Dallas may well be how thoroughly Texas protects hospitals - and their insurance companies - from answering for critical lapses in care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Thomas Eric Duncan entered the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital's emergency room on September 25 with a fever and complaining of stomach pain, there's a chance that proper treatment might have saved him from the Ebola virus that would kill him 13 days later. Instead, the Liberian man was sent home with only painkillers and antibiotics. Duncan's family and his fianc&eacute;e are haunted by the question of whether Duncan might have survived had he been properly diagnosed. Executives at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital have admitted to mistakes and apologized to Duncan's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But should Duncan's family members seek more than an apology, and ask the courts to hold the hospital accountable for its missteps, they won't find much recourse under Texas law. Neither will the nurses who contracted Ebola while treating Duncan, apparently for a time without sufficient safety gear, nor will anyone who might have contracted the virus from them later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to a number of Texas court decisions and laws - including a sweeping 2003 Republican-led tort reform effort - lawyers say it's unlikely that Presbyterian faces serious legal risk from the Ebola cases or others like them. Even if the hospital were found liable in court, the damages would be limited. Without the threat of expensive litigation, critics of tort reform argue, hospitals face little consequence for turning away sick, uninsured patients, even ones with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dallas Morning News has reported that Duncan's family members are considering a lawsuit against the hospital. The first challenge they would face is probably the greatest: proving that Duncan ever had a better-than-even chance of survival once he'd contracted the virus. With Ebola's global mortality rate estimated recently at 70%, doctors and hospitals are probably safe from ever answering for even the most blatant malpractice against an Ebola patient. That's not necessarily true in states where courts have adopted what's known as a &quot;loss of chance&quot; doctrine allowing lawsuits even when the chance of survival is under 50%. But Texas' courts have consistently shut the door to that possibility, ruling that if a patient was likely to die, then the hospital can't be held liable for malpractice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there were a way past that barrier, Duncan's family would face the same obstacles any other patient has since Texas' 2003 tort reform law took effect. The law requires emergency room patients to prove not just negligence on the part of hospital staff but &quot;willful and wanton&quot; negligence. That &quot;emergency room standard&quot; is one of a few changes introduced in the tort reform law that raised the standard for lawsuits against hospitals. Another section of the law, related to hospitals' responsibility for credentialing dangerous doctors, has protected another Dallas-area hospital from litigation over a dangerous Dallas neurosurgeon who killed two patients and paralyzed four others in a series of botched surgeries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paula Sweeney, a Dallas attorney with the law firm Slack and Davis and a former president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, says Duncan's family will have a difficult time proving wanton negligence. Though Presbyterian sent Duncan home after his first trip to the emergency room, the hospital staff did perform a CT scan and offer some treatment for his fever. &quot;Yes, they screwed up; yes, they turned away a guy with a fever with antibiotics,&quot; Sweeney says. &quot;But they did do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That minimum level of treatment is all that Texas courts would require, she says, and Duncan couldn't have paid for much more treatment, anyway. In that sense at least, his case is hardly unique. &quot;I think the treatment was more in line with somebody that doesn't have insurance,&quot; Sweeney says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweeney says plaintiffs may have a better chance proving the hospital was willfully negligent after Duncan returned to the emergency room. By then, hospitals everywhere would have been more alert to the possibility of patients arriving with Ebola, but according to some nurses' complaints, the hospital was still slow to treat him. At that point, though, it would be even harder to prove that the hospital's slow reaction time caused Duncan's death, because he was already so ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Duncan's family somehow overcomes all those barriers, Texas law ensures the hospital won't pay much. The 2003 tort reform law capped pain and suffering damages for hospitals, in a case like Duncan's, at $500,000 - a quarter-million each for the doctor and the hospital. Because Duncan's income was fairly low - he was recently unemployed, and worked for a shipping firm in Liberia before that - his lost wages wouldn't add much to any pain and suffering award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been plenty of media speculation that the two nurses who contracted Ebola while caring for Duncan might take the hospital to court over alleged poor working conditions. Texas Presbyterian nurse Briana Aguirre complained recently that nurses were never given the proper gear to treat an Ebola patient safely. Duncan's medical records suggest the safety lapses went on for days. It seems that any competent trial attorney could argue that Presbyterian was a dangerous place to work. The nurses union, National Nurses United, has alleged that Duncan wasn't isolated immediately and was left in the emergency room for hours, that nurses didn't have proper protective suits and that the hospital had no protocol for handling an Ebola patient. Hospital executives and other nurses have defended Texas Presbyterian. They contend that, as the first U.S. hospital to deal with a walk-in Ebola patient, there were bound to be some problems-isolated mistakes in a hospital that generally provides good care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That issue will likely never reach a jury. Texas law likely prevents the nurses from pursuing litigation, attorneys say. Because Presbyterian's employees are covered by workers' compensation insurance, they can file claims for their health care and lost workdays but can't sue the hospital. Sweeney notes that, thanks to a 2012 Texas supreme court decision, even a nurse who isn't covered by workers' compensation would face the same challenges as any patient trying to sue. In Texas West Oaks Hospital, LP v Williams, the state supreme court determined that a &quot;health care liability claim&quot; isn't limited to patients suing over health care, but also covers nurses suing over an unsafe workplace, or even a hospital visitor who slips and falls. Any of those cases would have to meet the same tough liability standards that apply to patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what if someone outside Texas Presbyterian caught Ebola from one of those nurses? They wouldn't be covered by the hospital's workers' compensation insurance, so they'd be free to sue. But a late-1990s Texas supreme court decision, Praesel v Johnson, established that in Texas, doctors aren't responsible if a patient harms someone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweeney says the Ebola case in Dallas is &quot;the ultimate example&quot; of what tort reform has meant to Texas. &quot;Look at the catastrophic risk to people involved, to the health care providers, to the community, and there's no risk to the insurance company,&quot; she says. To Sweeney, tort reform's most insidious effect has been that hospitals are less scared of screwing up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You always hear about, 'Doctors are practicing defensive medicine because they're afraid of lawsuits,&quot; Sweeney says. &quot;The whole point of this Ebola case is they did not practice defensive medicine. We as a society expect them to practice defensive medicine. And the worst thing that can happen is a half-a-million dollar judgment. Big deal!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tort reform supporters in Texas say those concerns are overblown. &quot;The trial lawyers always say no one can file a lawsuit under the ER standard or collect, that's the complaint that I hear,&quot; said Mike Hull, an attorney for the Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a coalition of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. &quot;[Our] data is that there've been a little over 2,600 ER lawsuits under the new standard, and a little over $120 million in payouts. So the notion that no one files suit under the new standard or collects under it is false.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hull said he wasn't sure how that compared to the years before tort reform, but a study by University of Texas law professor Charles Silver showed that in the first four years under Texas' 2003 tort reform law, the number of malpractice claims decreased 60% and payouts dropped by a third. Silver's work has also shown that hospitals could institute tighter safety and quality controls, but aren't incentivized to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an old argument in Texas by now, one that's often left Silver and Hull in disagreement. But they do agree that Duncan's family would have a tough case, if only because Ebola is so deadly and because pure self-interest would incentivize doctors to keep it under control. &quot;The ridiculously high standard that Texas adopted with respect to ER doctors could affect the level of care that they use,&quot; Silver says, &quot;but I don't think that Ebola fits within the ordinary boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Silver says there isn't much chance the courts will change Texas' standards because of anything that's happened in the past few weeks. &quot;The Texas Supreme Court is notoriously anti-plaintiff and pro-health care provider. It seems extremely unlikely that they would expand the law in this particular area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an op-ed published in The Dallas Morning News last week, Duncan's nephew Josephus Weeks left little doubt that he places the blame squarely on the hospital. &quot;Their error set the wheels in motion for my uncle's death and additional Ebola cases,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and their ignorance, incompetence or indecency has created a national security threat for our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given the state of Texas law, a strongly worded letter may be all the recourse Duncan's family has.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A physician who recently returned to New York from Ebola-ravaged west Africa has tested positive for the disease, officials announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who lives in the Harlem neighbourhood of the city, was taken to hospital in New York on Thursday after displaying symptoms consistent with those caused by Ebola, including a fever of 100.3F (38C) - lower than the 103F (39.5C) that was initial reported by health officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preliminary test on Thursday confirmed that Spencer, who arrived back in New York from Guinea on 17 October, has the virus. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has sent a team to New York City to assist city and state officials in the response, will carry out a further test to confirm the result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told a press conference at Bellevue hospital on Thursday that they were monitoring four people with whom Spencer had contact. His fianc&eacute;e, Morgan Dixon, and two friends had been quarantined, while the fourth person, a taxi driver, was not considered to be at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer took several trips on the New York subway in the past week, visited the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn on Wednesday night and took an Uber cab, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders, the organisation with which he had been working in Africa, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for Ebola patients, under strictly controlled conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the word Ebola right now can spread fear just by the sound of the word,&quot; said New York state governor Andrew Cuomo at a press conference. &quot;Ebola is not an airborne illness, it is contracted when a person is extremely ill and symptomatic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials urged residents of New York not to panic, and drew a comparison with the response to an outbreak in Dallas, Texas, where the city's principal hospital bungled its initial contacts with an Ebola patient who later died, Thomas Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it's a frightening situation, I know when you watched it on the news and it was about Dallas it was frightening; that it's here in New York is more frightening,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;New York is a dense place, a lot of people are on top of each other. But the more facts you know, the less frightening the situation is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's apartment in Harlem was cordoned off on Thursday night, and health officials were on the scene, giving out information to residents. His fianc&eacute;e was being monitored in a separate quarantine ward at Bellevue hospital. A team of epidemiologists - referred to by mayor Bill de Blasio at the press conference as &quot;medical detectives&quot; - were questioning Spencer's contacts and using information from his Metrocard, which would give details of his subway travel, and credit cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, said Spencer had acted in accordance with its guidelines for returning field workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A person in New York City, who recently worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the Ebola-affected countries in west Africa, notified our office this morning to report having developed a fever,&quot; it said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber confirmed that one of its drivers had transported Spencer on Wednesday evening. The CDC and the New York department of health assured the company that its driver was unlikely to catch the disease. &quot;We have communicated this to the driver, and the [New York department of health] medical team met with the driver in person, assuring him that he is not at risk. Our thoughts are with the patient and his loved ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's public Facebook page, which has since been taken down, showed a photo of him dated 18 September wearing protective gear announcing he was heading to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders. It showed him checking into a location in Brussels on 16 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His LinkedIn profile identified him as a fellow of international emergency medicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Presbyterian hospital released a statement in which it did not identify Spencer by name but called the patient &quot;a dedicated humanitarian on the staff of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University medical center who went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said he has not returned to work at the hospital or seen any patients since returning from west Africa, where more than more than 4,500 people have died since the current outbreak began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have attempted to reassure New Yorkers that the city and state are safe. City health officials repeated that Ebola is difficult to contract, since people must come into direct contact with body fluids of an infected and symptomatic person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fears about the disease have swirled around New York's status as a transport hub. Airports in the metropolitan area process most of the of the passengers arriving in the US from west Africa every day. John F Kennedy international airport and Newark, New Jersey's airport are among only five in the US permitted to accept passengers from the worst-affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting on Monday, passengers from these countries will be monitored for 21 days after arriving in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the New York governor's Ebola preparedness plan, two ambulances are regularly stationed at JFK and Newark airports, the city's transit authority was provided with protective gear and training, and unannounced drills are being conducted at airports, college campuses and in subways. The governor designated eight hospitals in the state to handle Ebola patients, including Bellevue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ease healthcare workers' fears about the disease, New York City held an Ebola educational session on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama had spoken by telephone with both Cuomo and De Blasio about the positive test, the White House said, and discussed the deployment of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some CDC officials were already in New York and an additional response team would be there by late Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Craig Spencer's apartment in Harlem, kids on bicycles pull wheelies, showing off for the ranks of TV news cameras. There must be 40-odd journalists here, eight or nine TV vans, maybe fifteen or even 20 cameras pointed at the closed door of the building where New York's Ebola Patient Zero lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd has gathered to watch the cameras, which are trained on the door. Spencer is not here, of course - he's at Bellevue hospital - but there are rumours among the camera crews that specialist team will be arriving soon to sweep the apartment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are people selling street food. Say one thing for this city: when the apocalypse comes, there will be churros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Dunkin' Donuts a block away, patrons mock the earnestness of the TV reporters. Cashier Lynn Butts wonders if Spencer ever bought coffee here. &quot;I was thinking his face was familiar,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says she's scared - a little - by the thought of Ebola arriving in her neighbourhood, but not scared enough to stay home. &quot;New York can deal with it,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 9/11, one of the identifying cliches New Yorkers carry around with them, alongside &quot;the city that never sleeps,&quot; is the idea of resilience. This is a city that doesn't cower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, New York's fight-or-fight response has not been triggered. After the world watched Texas fumble its response when Thomas Duncan came down with the disease last month, New York isn't taking any chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is not to say that everyone is unafraid. Stan Malone, who says he lives across West 147th Street from Spencer, claims the whole neighbourhood is worried. &quot;People want to know why they haven't quarantined his entire building yet. Ebola is here in the city, and you can bet this won't be the last case,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malone says he had an aunt, an uncle and two cousins who lived two floors away from Spencer in the same building. They moved to a hotel on Thursday, he says, and want to be tested for the virus today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he seems to be the exception. Maybe it's a consequence of the confidence radiated by the authorities that the situation is completely under control, or maybe not, but there is no real sense of present danger on the streets. The subways are still full, the streets still busy. People are not panicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Vasquez also lives across the street from Spencer's apartment. When asked if he's worried, he cocks his head to one side and says &quot;Ah,&quot; then grins. &quot;Fifty percent,&quot; he says, smiling and wiggling his flattened palm to symbolize 'so-so'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to worry a little. It is dangerous,&quot; he says. &quot;People with lots of money, they can get medical care. People with less money ...&quot; He says he's not frightened, though. &quot;Nah. Not too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most New Yorkers, it seems that the city's first case of Ebola barely even registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There isn't much fear on the subway, unless you count the odd person neurotically rubbing their hands with Purell - which you can't, really, because this city hums with neuroses like that pretty much all of the time. It's a baseline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can spot someone wearing a mask in line at the deli, perhaps, but then again that's not unheard of. There may have been one or two more face masks than usual on the subway this morning - or, then again, there may not; the train conductor on the northbound 1 train isn't sure. He thinks for a while, and says he has seen one mask, maybe, and that's about normal. &quot;Ebola,&quot; he says with authority, &quot;isn't airborne, anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has he seen people showing signs of worry? He shrugs. &quot;Newspapers,&quot; he says, cryptically and perhaps slightly accusingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annie Hang, an administrative assistant living in Brooklyn, stands on the platform of the A-C-E line at West 4th street, waiting for the northbound train. She is listening to her iPod - like many New Yorkers, hermetically sealed in mind, if not in body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is she worried about taking the train? &quot;More about holding the poles,&quot; she laughs. She always uses hand sanitizer, she says. &quot;I am always mindful of what I am touching now.&quot; She's not really that worried. &quot;There's nothing I can do about it. So ...&quot; She shrugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Nicholas lives a few blocks from the bowling alley visited by Spencer on Wednesday night. Asked if he was worried about Ebola now that it had come to New York, Nicholas says no, &quot;but my mom is.&quot; He is waiting at the Bedford Avenue L station in Williamsburg for a train into Manhattan on Friday morning. &quot;I don't really care,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is New York,&quot; says Roy Bell, a singer with an a capella group busking on the R train which follows Broadway north as far as Times Square. &quot;It's gotta spread a lot before we start to panic.&quot; Strangers on the train nod in agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the northbound 3 train, two tourists chat with a young American guy in a backpack. At 72nd street, the two stand up to leave the train, gathering their luggage and shopping bags. &quot;This is our stop. Nice chatting with you!&quot; one of them says, and then, by way of a sardonic farewell, adds: &quot;Don't get Ebola!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kid grins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Erin McCann and Jana Kasperkevic contributed reporting.                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Teacher workloads. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has established a &quot;workload challenge&quot; to free teachers from bureaucracy. Teachers are invited to discuss ways to ease pressure on the Times Education Supplement website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Early years. Extra power is being given to schools to enrol two-year-olds under new legislation currently going through parliament that removes bureaucratic hurdles. The law is designed to improve early education standards.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bad week for</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Healthy teeth. A public health survey found that in some parts of the country half of five-year-olds have tooth decay or fillings. It also found that 12% of young children in England suffered from tooth decay. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has called for nurseries and primary schools to step in when it comes to oral hygiene. Share your views on the issue here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Headteachers with big pay packets. The education secretary Nicky Morgan has said that school leaders should think very carefully about levels of pay and make sure as much public money as possible is spent on &quot;frontline education&quot;.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">What you're saying</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week we asked you which film character you would most like to be in school. We had a range of responses from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Harry Potters' Dumbledore to King Julian from Madagascar. Other suggestions included Katniss Everdeen and the shark from Jaws. A very mixed bag! Keep sharing your characters with us via @GuardianTeach using #filminschools.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Photograph of the week</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity ActionAid sent out resources on the Ebola virus to thousands of schools to give students a better grasp of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new study has found that teachers are not trained to deal with bereavement. According to a study by Ellie Stokes, a University College of Birmingham final year student who researched the subject as part of her dissertation, seven out of 10 schools are likely to have a bereaved child on the roll at any one time, but staff are not always equipped to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers should be paid 25% more to work in some of the country's most deprived areas, according to a new report. The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission called for high-performing teachers to be brought into to the most challenging schools.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Dates to remember</SPAN><BR></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tona, my youngest son, turned two today. I couldn't be with him on his special day, I couldn't hold him, play with him or do any of the things dads are supposed to do the day their babies turn two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, I spent the day thousands of miles away in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia, surrounded by several children who had recently been in direct contact with an Ebola patient.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two children at the centre showed symptoms of Ebola the morning of my visit. I was asked to keep a distance from them to reduce the risks of infection. As a communicator I never imagined how difficult and frustrating this no-touch policy would be in practice. Forget handshaking. No hug. No group photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola hits these children twice. First, it takes their parents away, then it subjects them to stigma, rejection and even abuse. They do not have the comfort, care and attention a child needs in times of grief. Sometimes their own relatives are too scared to take them back. Fear of contagion is becoming stronger than family ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In west Africa where I have been living for years, children often run to greet visitors and hold their hands. Here, for the first time in my life, I had to refrain from establishing any physical contact and showing the most natural sign of human compassion. It's an awful and awkward feeling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you are two metres away from the person you are talking to, establishing a connection is challenging. But I try. We start by talking about football, our favorite food and games. Shirley, an 11-year-old who arrived seven days ago with her two brothers, aged five and nine, smiles and opens up. &quot;My mother and father died. All this because of Ebola,&quot; she says. &quot;Here we play, eat, take showers and sleep. I want to go home. I don't know if people still want me where I lived before. I know I have to stay here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, in the course of the conversation, one of the boys, Daniel, feels more confident and gets closer to me. Too close. He must be two or three. I stop talking and subtly take a step back but he notices. My eyes betray the fear I feel: neither the armed rebels in the Central African Republic nor the aftershocks of the earthquake in Haiti scared me as much as this toddler touching me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes me a few seconds to compose myself. I work for Unicef, an organisation set up to care for children, and yet I am petrified by a vulnerable child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immunity to Ebola thought to have been developed by survivors makes them ideal candidates to work with children like Daniel. But they need to be vetted and trained. Plans are now under way to open more interim care centres in the worst affected counties, and 50 survivors in total will be involved in running to these centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, with their parents and guardians at Ebola treatment centres, these children couldn't be reunited with their families and had nowhere to go. It made me sad that I couldn't hug Daniel, or hold his hand. Fortunately for these children, survivors are able to provide that human connection - a hug, a pat on the back, a reassuring touch that reminds them they are not alone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 is currently 17.90 points lower at 6401.25, with a weak Chinese property market, disappointing results from Amazon overnight and a confirmed case of Ebola in New York all helping to take the shine off shares. UK GDP has little effect so far, meeting expectations of a 0.7% rise. Mike McCudden at Interactive Investor said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite some positive corporate and economic news the latest Ebola scare in the US has given nervous investors cause to retreat. With the risk of the virus spreading being very low this may appear to be an opportunity to invest. However, with on-going global economic concerns and upcoming data from the euro zone investors may be well advised to sit on the sidelines. On the stock front, Amazon has not helped the outlook for the US open today after reporting a huge third quarter loss. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Shire is down 19p at &pound;38.76 ahead of third quarter figures due later. US predator AbbVie recently called of its proposed bid for the company due to changes in tax inversion rules, so the results will be examined to see where Shire intends to go from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Hikma Pharmaceutical has dropped 105p to &pound;17.95 after US regulator the Food and Drink Administration raised issues regarding its plant in Portugal. The warning letter follows an inspection by the FDA in March. Analyst Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stock is not priced for downgrades. Just as well the warning letter by FDA regarding the Portuguese manufacturing facility seems to be relatively low grade and is unlikely to affect manufacturing. The warning letter relates to the Portuguese manufacturing facility, a site that is involved in the manufacture of mainly injectable products. The warning letter relates to investigations and environmental monitoring at the facility, which a low grade warning and should not necessarily impact production short-term. Worryingly, though, Portugal also set the blueprint for the management of sites in the US (e.g. Cherry Hill) so although on the face of it, this letter is not a particular worry, it will remind investors that pharmaceutical manufacturing is not without risk and in fact Hikma itself has benefited in recent years from manufacturing constraints of competitor Hospira. The stock had risen significantly in recent weeks in anticipation of an involvement in the transformative acquisition of CorePharma LLC, a portfolio company of PE house RoundTable Healthcare, which has now been sold for $700m to Impax Laboratories. Hikma is unlikely to enter a competitive bid situation. The transaction - had it happened - was expected to add around $250-350m revenues and $90-105m EBITDA sort of range. To us, the deal would have made strategic sense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the telecoms groups, BT is down 8.8p at 367.8p after Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation from equal weight to underweight. The bank pointed to increased broadband competition and growing pension liabilities, and suggested it may pay up to &pound;1bn a year for future Premier League rights for its sports channel, compared to around &pound;246m now. The bank said: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next Premier League auction is set for early 2015. BT currently broadcasts matches at Saturday 12:45pm. Our AlphaWise survey shows that this slot is the least popular over the weekend. Hence, BT could bid aggressively for the more popular Sunday 4pm viewing. BT currently pays &pound;246m per annum on Premier League content. If BT were to spend &pound;1bn per annum for rights to the 2017/18 season, this would represent a 25% downgrade on 2017 estimated free cash flow and lower the free cash flow yield from 7.9% to only 5.5%. Of course, BT could charge more for BT Sport and target new customer wins, but there are clearly greater risks to the BT equity story, as it faces the transition to pay-TV. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the pension, Morgan Stanley estimated a pre-tax pension deficit of &pound;5.5bn as of June 30, 2014 from the last triennial valuation of &pound;3.9bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TalkTalk Telecom has slipped 5.5p to 286p as Nomura cut from buy to neutral with its target price lowered from 330p to 300p. Dealers had heard talk earlier in the week that Vodafone, up 2.2p at 199.05p, or BSkyB, 9.5p better at 869p, might be interested in the business. Nomura said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have been increasingly concerned that TalkTalk would not be able to maintain the earnings momentum required to justify its valuation premium. First, it was the UK's VAT ruling on early payment schemes, second, it was Ofcom's final decision on [BT's superfast broadband] charges, which were less than favourable for resellers. And now consensus figures suggest a mountain for TalkTalk to climb in the second half in order to meet the market's full-year estimates. Even if last year's seasonality in marketing spend is observed and there is a large price hike to affect the fourth quarter, we expect that an 80% second half over first increase in EBITDA may prove challenging and earnings momentum is set to stall at best. In addition, the unexpected departure of the chief financial officer does not fill us with confidence that his replacement may not take a natural opportunity to revise targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Morgan Stanley's note indicated it preferred Vodafone over BT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back among the fallers, Pearson has fallen 27p to &pound;11.42 after the publishing and education group reported flat underlying nine month revenues and said chief financial officer Robin Freestone would step down by the end of next year. Numis said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in another in line statement is a small positive, the loss of the CFO negative. No change to forecasts. We remain comfortable with our Hold, we see better safer value elsewhere in the sector. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pharmaceutical and telecoms shares are in the spotlight as leading shares slip back after three days of gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 is currently 17.90 points lower at 6401.25, with a weak Chinese property market, disappointing results from Amazon overnight and a confirmed case of Ebola in New York all helping to take the shine off shares. UK GDP has little effect so far, meeting expectations of a 0.7% rise. Mike McCudden at Interactive Investor said:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite some positive corporate and economic news the latest Ebola scare in the US has given nervous investors cause to retreat. With the risk of the virus spreading being very low this may appear to be an opportunity to invest. However, with on-going global economic concerns and upcoming data from the euro zone investors may be well advised to sit on the sidelines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To kick off this week's particularly sophisticated viral video rundown, we have a short film called The Runners. Directed by Matan Rochlitz and Ivo Gormley, the film features interviews with people running in east London's Victoria Park. Runners open up about all manner of things - from sex with their husbands to running a marathon for their sick fathers. Writing about his reasons for making the film in the Guardian, Ivo Gormley said:&quot;We were trying to understand what goes on in the minds of runners as they charge through the streets. What does it do to them and what can we find out about ourselves by interrupting them at this moment of vulnerability and clarity?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rare sober moment from Fox News next. In an extended piece to camera, news anchor Shep Smith urges viewers not to listen to the &quot;hysterical voices on the television&quot; talking about Ebola. &quot;The people who say and write hysterical things are being very irresponsible,&quot; he says. &quot;There is no Ebola spreading in America. Should that change, our reporting will change. But there is nothing to indicate that it will.&quot; It's not clear whether the clip has done so well because it provides reassurance to Americans panicked about the infectious disease spreading through west Africa, or because of the irony of the message coming from Fox News.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin America has really gone all out on their latest marketing campaign. BLAH airlines is a fictional mediocre airline, with a website (&quot;Free cup with every decaffeinated coffee order&quot;) and a twitter handle ( @BLAHAirlines, &quot;We are passionate about clear aisles.&quot;) A five hour 46 minute long video, starring plastic dummies, simulates exactly what it would be like to fly with BLAH airlines from Newark to San Francisco. The intended implication seems to be that Virgin America would be better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere on the internet, Ian McKellen visits Chew Valley School in Bristol to talk about gay issues and the work the school are doing to eradicate bullying. &quot;If you don't do your revision properly, do you know what will happen?&quot;, he asks a group of excited children. &quot;You shall not pass!,&quot; he bellows, channeling Gandalf, one of his most famous characters. The children are understandably thrilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian actress Alia Bhatt is driving home late one night when her car breaks down on a deserted road. A group of men pull up next to her and peer in through her car window. What does she do next? This is a fictional utopia where women don't have reason to be afraid of strange men, so she gets out of the car and asks them for help, obviously. The film was made for Vogue India to promote women's rights in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now for a meticulously choreographed half-time show from the Ohio state marching band. During the break at a football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and Rutgers, the band performs a classic rock themed act, where they arrange themselves into rock and roll themed shapes while playing their instruments. It's multitasking at its best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also this week, we have a &quot; breakdance conversation &quot; between Jimmy Fallon and Brad Pitt, a backflop in slow motion (from the Slow Mo Guys ) and a racial profiling experiment from YouTubers True Story ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to round off a viral video chart that has been totally free of cats and unfortunate accidents, we have a British Film Institute trailer for Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which will be re-released in cinemas on 28 November. The 2 minute video reminds us exactly why the film is a classic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Spencer was halfway through the recommended 21-day self-monitoring period for those at risk from the Ebola virus when he went bowling in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 33-year-old physician had been working with Doctors Without Borders on the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, one of the three west African countries worst affected by the virus. He finished his work there on 12 October and left the country on 14 October, flying home to John F Kennedy airport in New York via Europe. He arrived in New York on 17 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days since returning to his apartment in Harlem, he was careful to check his temperature twice a day as part of his monitoring process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at some point between returning home from Guinea and experiencing symptoms, officials said, Spencer took a three-mile jog, despite being on a self-imposed limited-contact regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, it seems likely that he thought he was in the clear by Wednesday evening, when he decided to go with friends to Gutter, a bowling alley in Williamsburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did, authorities confirmed at a press conference on Thursday, bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the day on Wednesday, he may have walked on the High Line - a wildly popular tourist attraction on the west side of Manhattan built on a former elevated railway - and may have also eaten at a restaurant near there, according to officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is known for sure that he travelled on three subway lines - the 1-train, the A-train and the L-train - as well as an Uber taxi. Epidemiologists were using information gathered from Spencer's New York Metrocard - which records the entry points to subway journeys - and his credit cards, to determine his movements around the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber confirmed that Spencer had been given a ride Wednesday evening, and told the Guardian that it had contacted the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York department of health, who had told it that neither the driver nor any of his subsequent passengers were at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer had no fever when he left his apartment on Wednesday, and continued to check his temperature. He told health authorities that began to experience fatigue on Wednesday night, but was otherwise feeling well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high fever on Thursday morning was the first time Spencer displayed symptoms which indicated Ebola, authorities said, and emphasised that it was unlikely he would have been infectious before that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was between 10am and 11am on Thursday, when he developed both a 103-degree fever and gastro-enterital symptoms, that he contacted Doctors Without Borders, who in turn contacted the New York health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An emergency medical crew arrived in full protective gear and took him to Bellevue in an ambulance surrounded by police squad cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This triggered a series of responses that had been exhaustively rehearsed over the weeks that had passed since America's first Ebola patient, Thomas Duncan, was diagnosed with the virus at a hospital in Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer was brought to New York's Bellevue Hospital, one of five hospitals in the state which have been designated to handle patients with the disease, by a team of specially-trained paramedics in full hazmat suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;meticulous&quot; individual, he was careful to make sure his apartment was locked behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer is currently in an isolation ward unit at Bellevue hospital that was built during the Aids epidemic in the 1990s, when it was designed to deal with immuno-compromised patients suffering from tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since returning from Guinea, it is confirmed that he had been in contact with his fiancee - who is currently under supervision and in isolation also at Bellevue hospital, where she is currently showing no symptoms that would indicate Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other friends have been given the option of home quarantine. All three are said to currently be healthy, but will be monitored until they clear the 21-day incubation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the press conference, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, compared New York's preparedness favourably with the response in Dallas, saying it was the &quot;exact opposite&quot; of what happened there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dallas unfortunately was caught before they could prepare, before they what they knew what they were dealing with, and we had the advantage of learning from the Dallas experience,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Duncan, the Dallas patient, was at first sent home from Texas Health Presbyterian hospital and was later left in open waiting rooms, according to reports by the nurses' union, which also alleged that healthcare personnel were forced to seal gaps in their protective equipment with surgical tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two nurses in Dallas contracted the disease from Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuomo said that New York had been &quot;fortunate ... that the affected was a doctor&quot; who &quot;was familiar with the possibility and the symptoms, and handled himself accordingly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is New York, people fly in and out every day,&quot; said Cuomo. &quot;We can't say that this is an unexpected circumstance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the diagnosis was suspected, a team from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was dispatched to New York to assist with Spencer's treatment and the public health response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of what officials called &quot;an abundance of caution&quot;, the bowling alley Spencer attended will be closed on Friday for a full inspection by health authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A physician who recently returned to New York from Ebola-ravaged west Africa has tested positive for the disease, officials announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who lives in the Harlem neighbourhood of the city, was taken to hospital in New York on Thursday after displaying symptoms consistent with those caused by Ebola, including a fever of 103F (39.5C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preliminary test on Thursday confirmed that Spencer, who arrived back in New York from Guinea on 17 October, has the virus. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has sent a team to New York City to assist city and state officials in the response, will carry out a further test to confirm the result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told a press conference at Bellevue hospital on Thursday that they were monitoring four people with whom Spencer had contact. His fianc&eacute;e, Morgan Dixon, and two friends had been quarantined, while the fourth person, a taxi driver, was not considered to be at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer took several trips on the New York subway in the past week, visited the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn on Wednesday night and took an Uber cab, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders, the organisation with which he had been working in Africa, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for Ebola patients, under strictly controlled conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the word Ebola right now can spread fear just by the sound of the word,&quot; said New York state governor Andrew Cuomo at a press conference. &quot;Ebola is not an airborne illness, it is contracted when a person is extremely ill and symptomatic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials urged residents of New York not to panic, and drew a comparison with the response to an outbreak in Dallas, Texas, where the city's principal hospital bungled its initial contacts with an Ebola patient who later died, Thomas Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it's a frightening situation, I know when you watched it on the news and it was about Dallas it was frightening; that it's here in New York is more frightening,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;New York is a dense place, a lot of people are on top of each other. But the more facts you know, the less frightening the situation is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's apartment in Harlem was cordoned off on Thursday night, and health officials were on the scene, giving out information to residents. His fianc&eacute;e was being monitored in a separate quarantine ward at Bellevue hospital. A team of epidemiologists - referred to by mayor Bill de Blasio at the press conference as &quot;medical detectives&quot; - were questioning Spencer's contacts and using information from his Metrocard, which would give details of his subway travel, and credit cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, said Spencer had acted in accordance with its guidelines for returning field workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A person in New York City, who recently worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the Ebola-affected countries in west Africa, notified our office this morning to report having developed a fever,&quot; it said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber confirmed that one of its drivers had transported Spencer on Wednesday evening. The CDC and the New York department of health assured the company that its driver was unlikely to catch the disease. &quot;We have communicated this to the driver, and the [New York department of health] medical team met with the driver in person, assuring him that he is not at risk. Our thoughts are with the patient and his loved ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's public Facebook page, which has since been taken down, showed a photo of him dated 18 September wearing protective gear announcing he was heading to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders. It showed him checking into a location in Brussels on 16 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His LinkedIn profile identified him as a fellow of international emergency medicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Presbyterian hospital released a statement in which it did not identify Spencer by name but called the patient &quot;a dedicated humanitarian on the staff of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University medical center who went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said he has not returned to work at the hospital or seen any patients since returning from west Africa, where more than more than 4,500 people have died since the current outbreak began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have attempted to reassure New Yorkers that the city and state are safe. City health officials repeated that Ebola is difficult to contract, since people must come into direct contact with body fluids of an infected and symptomatic person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fears about the disease have swirled around New York's status as a transport hub. Airports in the metropolitan area process most of the of the passengers arriving in the US from west Africa every day. John F Kennedy international airport and Newark, New Jersey's airport are among only five in the US permitted to accept passengers from the worst-affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting on Monday, passengers from these countries will be monitored for 21 days after arriving in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the New York governor's Ebola preparedness plan, two ambulances are regularly stationed at JFK and Newark airports, the city's transit authority was provided with protective gear and training, and unannounced drills are being conducted at airports, college campuses and in subways. The governor designated eight hospitals in the state to handle Ebola patients, including Bellevue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ease healthcare workers' fears about the disease, New York City held an Ebola educational session on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama had spoken by telephone with both Cuomo and De Blasio about the positive test, the White House said, and discussed the deployment of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some CDC officials were already in New York and an additional response team would be there by late Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To kick off this week's particularly sophisticated viral video rundown, we have a short film called The Runners. Directed by Matan Rochlitz and Ivo Gormley, the film features interviews with people running in east London's Victoria Park. Runners open up about all manner of things - from sex with their husbands to running a marathon for their sick fathers. Writing about his reasons for making the film in the Guardian, Ivo Gormley said:&quot;We were trying to understand what goes on in the minds of runners as they charge through the streets. What does it do to them and what can we find out about ourselves by interrupting them at this moment of vulnerability and clarity?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rare sober moment from Fox News next. In an extended piece to camera, news anchor Shep Smith urges viewers not to listen to the &quot;hysterical voices on the television&quot; talking about Ebola. &quot;The people who say and write hysterical things are being very irresponsible,&quot; he says. &quot;There is no Ebola spreading in America. Should that change, our reporting will change. But there is nothing to indicate that it will.&quot; It's not clear whether the clip has done so well because it provides reassurance to Americans panicked about the infectious disease spreading through west Africa, or because of the irony of the message coming from Fox News.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin America has really gone all out on their latest marketing campaign. BLAH airlines is a fictional mediocre airline, with a website (&quot;Free cup with every decaffeinated coffee order&quot;) and a twitter handle ( @BLAHAirlines, &quot;We are passionate about clear aisles.&quot;) A five hour 46 minute long video, starring plastic dummies, simulates exactly what it would be like to fly with BLAH airlines from Newark to San Francisco. The intended implication seems to be that Virgin America would be better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere on the internet, Ian McKellen visits Chew Valley School in Bristol to talk about gay issues and the work the school are doing to eradicate bullying. &quot;If you don't do your revision properly, do you know what will happen?&quot;, he asks a group of excited children. &quot;You shall not pass!,&quot; he bellows, channeling Gandalf, one of his most famous characters. The children are understandably thrilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian actress Alia Bhatt is driving home late one night when her car breaks down on a deserted road. A group of men pull up next to her and peer in through her car window. What does she do next? This is a fictional utopia where women don't have reason to be afraid of strange men, so she gets out of the car and asks them for help, obviously. The film was made for Vogue India to promote women's rights in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now for a meticulously choreographed half-time show from the Ohio state marching band. During the break at a football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and Rutgers, the band performs a classic rock themed act, where they arrange themselves into rock and roll themed shapes while playing their instruments. It's multitasking at its best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also this week, we have a &quot; breakdance conversation &quot; between Jimmy Fallon and Brad Pitt, a backflop in slow motion (from the Slow Mo Guys ) and a racial profiling experiment from YouTubers True Story ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to round off a viral video chart that has been totally free of cats and unfortunate accidents, we have a British Film Institute trailer for Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which will be re-released in cinemas on 28 November. The 2 minute video reminds us exactly why the film is a classic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A physician who recently returned to New York from Ebola-ravaged west Africa has tested positive for the disease, officials announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who lives in the Harlem neighbourhood of the city, was taken to hospital in New York on Thursday after displaying symptoms consistent with those caused by Ebola, including a fever of 103F (39.5C).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preliminary test on Thursday confirmed that Spencer, who arrived back in New York from Guinea on 17 October, has the virus. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has sent a team to New York City to assist city and state officials in the response, will carry out a further test to confirm the result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials told a press conference at Bellevue hospital on Thursday that they were monitoring four people with whom Spencer had contact. His fianc&eacute;e, Morgan Dixon, and two friends had been quarantined, while the fourth person, a taxi driver, was not considered to be at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer took several trips on the New York subway in the past week, visited the Gutter bowling alley in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn on Wednesday night and took an Uber cab, all before he began to display symptoms, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began to feel feverish on Thursday between 10am and 11am. He contacted Doctors Without Borders, the organisation with which he had been working in Africa, which in turn contacted the New York department of health. Officials organised for him to be transported to Bellevue hospital in the city, a designated site for Ebola patients, under strictly controlled conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the word Ebola right now can spread fear just by the sound of the word,&quot; said New York state governor Andrew Cuomo at a press conference. &quot;Ebola is not an airborne illness, it is contracted when a person is extremely ill and symptomatic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials urged residents of New York not to panic, and drew a comparison with the response to an outbreak in Dallas, Texas, where the city's principal hospital bungled its initial contacts with an Ebola patient who later died, Thomas Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it's a frightening situation, I know when you watched it on the news and it was about Dallas it was frightening; that it's here in New York is more frightening,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;New York is a dense place, a lot of people are on top of each other. But the more facts you know, the less frightening the situation is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's apartment in Harlem was cordoned off on Thursday night, and health officials were on the scene, giving out information to residents. His fianc&eacute;e was being monitored in a separate quarantine ward at Bellevue hospital. A team of epidemiologists - referred to by mayor Bill de Blasio at the press conference as &quot;medical detectives&quot; - were questioning Spencer's contacts and using information from his Metrocard, which would give details of his subway travel, and credit cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, said Spencer had acted in accordance with its guidelines for returning field workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A person in New York City, who recently worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the Ebola-affected countries in west Africa, notified our office this morning to report having developed a fever,&quot; it said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber confirmed that one of its drivers had transported Spencer on Wednesday evening. The CDC and the New York department of health assured the company that its driver was unlikely to catch the disease. &quot;We have communicated this to the driver, and the [New York department of health] medical team met with the driver in person, assuring him that he is not at risk. Our thoughts are with the patient and his loved ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's public Facebook page, which has since been taken down, showed a photo of him dated 18 September wearing protective gear announcing he was heading to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders. It showed him checking into a location in Brussels on 16 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His LinkedIn profile identified him as a fellow of international emergency medicine at Columbia University-New York Presbyterian hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Presbyterian hospital released a statement in which it did not identify Spencer by name but called the patient &quot;a dedicated humanitarian on the staff of NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University medical center who went to an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said he has not returned to work at the hospital or seen any patients since returning from west Africa, where more than more than 4,500 people have died since the current outbreak began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have attempted to reassure New Yorkers that the city and state are safe. City health officials repeated that Ebola is difficult to contract, since people must come into direct contact with body fluids of an infected and symptomatic person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fears about the disease have swirled around New York's status as a transport hub. Airports in the metropolitan area process most of the of the passengers arriving in the US from west Africa every day. John F Kennedy international airport and Newark, New Jersey's airport are among only five in the US permitted to accept passengers from the worst-affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting on Monday, passengers from these countries will be monitored for 21 days after arriving in the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the New York governor's Ebola preparedness plan, two ambulances are regularly stationed at JFK and Newark airports, the city's transit authority was provided with protective gear and training, and unannounced drills are being conducted at airports, college campuses and in subways. The governor designated eight hospitals in the state to handle Ebola patients, including Bellevue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ease healthcare workers' fears about the disease, New York City held an Ebola educational session on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama had spoken by telephone with both Cuomo and De Blasio about the positive test, the White House said, and discussed the deployment of officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some CDC officials were already in New York and an additional response team would be there by late Thursday night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Spencer, 33, a doctor who lives in the Harlem neighbourhood of Manhattan, was taken to hospital in New York City on Thursday after displaying symptoms consistent with those caused by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preliminary test confirmed that Spencer has the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials had already said they were tracing the doctor's contacts, which the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, said were not numerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our understanding very few people were in direct contact with him,&quot; de Blasio told a news conference before the diagnosis was confirmed. &quot;Every protocol has been followed. We're hoping for a good outcome for this individual,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City health officials said Spencer worked in one of the three west African countries affected by Ebola, which has killed more than 4,500 people since the current outbreak began. They said he returned to the US within the last 21 days, which is the maximum incubation period for the virus. It is believed he had been working in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physician was transported by a team wearing protective gear to Bellevue hospital with a fever and &quot;gastrointestinal symptoms&quot; on Thursday. Though the city's statement did not specify, severe diarrhoea is a common Ebola symptom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A person in New York City, who recently worked with Doctors Without Borders in one of the Ebola-affected countries in west Africa, notified our office this morning to report having developed a fever,&quot; Doctors Without Borders said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aid organisation, known internationally as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, said Spencer reported his fever immediately to the agency, in accordance with its guidelines for returning field workers. It was unclear whether the doctor had been quarantining himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer's public Facebook page, which has since been taken down, showed a photo of him dated 18 September wearing protective gear announcing he was heading to Guinea with Doctors without Borders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international response to the Ebola epidemic in west Africa is too slow and providing too few beds for the sick to stop the soaring number of cases and deaths, scientists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     A paper in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal models the response in Montserrado, Liberia, against the spread of the virus and warns that current efforts will not bring the outbreak under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our predictions highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak, and averting a catastrophic toll of new Ebola cases and deaths in the coming months,&quot; warns Alison Galvani, senior author and professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their paper, she and colleagues say: &quot;Although we might still be within the midst of what will ultimately be viewed as the early phase of the current Ebola virus disease outbreak, the window of opportunity for aversion of calamitous repercussions from an initially delayed and insufficient response is diminishing rapidly. Our predictions suggest that current commitments are grossly inadequate to provide beds for all affected individuals, even only considering near-term growth of the epidemic in Montserrado.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Yale scientists find that if nothing more is done, there will be more than 170,000 Ebola cases - including those that are unreported - and more than 90,000 deaths by 15 December in Montserrado, a densely populated county containing the capital, Monrovia, and which has one of the highest case rates in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a rapid growth in provision by 31 October, including 4,800 beds and a five-fold increase in the speed of case detection, and if protective kits are allocated to families forced to nurse patients at home for want of a bed, nearly 98,000 of those cases could be prevented, they say. But if the response is delayed to 15 November, only about 54,000, would be prevented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 4,800 beds is more than are currently planned. The US, which is leading the response in Liberia, has promised 17 new treatment centres with beds for 1,700 patients in Montserrado. As of 15 October, Liberia, according to the World Health Organisation, had 620 Ebola beds, 21% of the planned total of 2,930 for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Findings of our analysis suggest that the capacity of Ebola virus disease treatment centres needed to reduce the severity of the current outbreak greatly exceeds current international commitments,&quot; the authors write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other scientists questioned whether it was possible to model the progression of a fast-moving epidemic in the way the Yale authors have and Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said the number of new cases had already plateaued in the area. &quot;It's too early to say whether the ongoing and intense control efforts in Monrovia have yet achieved control or merely slowed the epidemic, but what is being seen on the ground is clearly incompatible with the results in this paper,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others said the predictions were valid and useful. &quot;There are so many unknowns in this current outbreak, especially the true number of infected individuals, but despite the uncertainties, this work generates a roadmap highlighting the most effective methods of containment and the impacts of past and future delays on our ability to stop this outbreak,&quot; said Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a meeting of the WHO's emergency committee has urged countries unaffected by Ebola not to introduce travel bans to and from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, which may lead to more people attempting to leave the epidemic countries. &quot;A general travel ban is likely to cause economic hardship, and could consequently increase the uncontrolled migration of people from affected countries, raising the risk of international spread of Ebola,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urged the normalisation of air and sea traffic, to reduce the economic damage the region is suffering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHNSON &amp; Johnson is to start testing its Ebola vaccine candidate in January after the World Health Organisation (WHO) and world leaders asked the US drug giant and other companies to accelerate their research programmes. GlaxoSmithKline, which is at a more advanced stage of vaccine development, separately said it would have the first doses of its serum available by the end of the year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> J&amp;J said healthy volunteers in America, Africa and Europe would start receiving the vaccine, which has already shown &quot;promise&quot; in animal testing, early in the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has pledged $200m (&pound;124m) to accelerate the research programme and plans to manufacture 1m doses over the course of next year. It said 250,000 of these will be released for &quot;broad application&quot; in clinical trials by May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Paul Stoffels, J&amp;J's chief medical officer, stressed that the WHO's priority is still to bring the epidemic under control by medical measures such as isolating and treating infected people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sign of the urgency with which the epidemic is being treated by the pharmaceuticals industry, Dr Stoffels said he had spoken with Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, &quot;several times&quot; on the potential for collaboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GSK is one of two other drug makers developing a vaccine and is already running trials on healthy volunteers in the US, UK and Mali. Sir Andrew said the company was &quot;leaving no stone unturned&quot; in the project. Canadian biotech NewLink is also working on an experimental vaccine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHNSON &amp; Johnson is to start testing its Ebola vaccine candidate in January after the World Health Organisation (WHO) and world leaders asked the US drug giant and other companies to accelerate their research programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GlaxoSmithKline, which is at a more advanced stage of vaccine development, separately said it would have the first doses of its serum available by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> J&amp;J said healthy volunteers in America, Africa and Europe would start receiving the vaccine, which has already shown &quot;promise&quot; in animal testing, early in the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has pledged $200m (&pound;124m) to accelerate the research programme and plans to manufacture 1m doses over the course of next year. It said 250,000 of these will be released for &quot;broad application&quot; in clinical trials by May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Paul Stoffels, J&amp;J's chief medical officer, stressed that the WHO's priority is still to bring the epidemic under control by medical measures such as isolating and treating infected people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sign of the urgency with which the epidemic is being treated by the pharmaceuticals industry, Dr Stoffels said he had spoken with Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, &quot;several times&quot; on the potential for collaboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GSK is one of two other drug makers developing a vaccine and is already running trials on healthy volunteers in the US, UK and Mali. Sir Andrew said the company was &quot;leaving no stone unturned&quot; in the project. Canadian biotech NewLink is also working on an experimental vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Stoffels said the British company and other vaccine makers were ready to help produce more of the J&amp;J vaccine should it prove the most effective. Likewise, he said J&amp;J could help manufacture a rival's vaccine should it prove more powerful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UK Independence Party has accused the Red Cross of &quot;playing politics with people's lives&quot; after the charity refused to accept a donation raised through the sales of its comic &quot;Ukip Calypso&quot; song.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mike Read, a former BBC Radio 1 presenter, offered to give all the funds raised from the song to the charity to help victims of Ebola after it was described as racist by critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Red Cross has said that it will not accept the donation because the song, which Read wrote and performed in a cod-Jamaican accent, was party political and contains an attack on refugees and asylum seekers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The song praises Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage, and says the Labour Party &quot;committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, the song had reached No 21 in the midweek singles chart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Read apologised for &quot;unintentionally causing offence&quot; with the tune and asked his record company to withdraw it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steven Crowther, Ukip's chairman, said that the party was &quot;staggered&quot; by the charity's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;We regret that the British Red Cross think it's their place to put politics over saving people's lives. We will seek to donate all the money to another charity working to help tackle the tragic Ebola crisis in West Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the charity said: &quot;We will not be able to accept any money from the proceeds of this single.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a neutral organisation, we cannot benefit from something which overtly supports one political party. In addition, the Red Cross has a proud history of helping refugees and asylum seekers who are negatively referred to in the lyrics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ukip had previously accused critics of creating &quot;synthetic&quot; outrage over the song.</SPAN></P>

It's worth mentioning that the Red Cross responded by saying it cannot accept donations from party political sources, and that its job is to help precisely those that Mike Read and Ukip &quot;negatively refer to&quot;. Oh, and it doesn't have an Ebola outreach programme. And before the single was withdrawn, it was made clear that all proceeds from sales were for Ukip party funds. Dan AdlerFarnham, Surrey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Jonathan Watts reports from Rio de Janeiro that 402 square&nbsp;kilometres - &quot;more than six times the area of the island of Manhattan&quot; - of the Brazilian Amazon was cleared in September ( Report, 20 October). Being English and reading my English newspaper in England this is of limited value. How many Isles of Wight is that? Chas MooreWickford, Essex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; I read with interest the funeral directors' comments about people taking out their own penny insurance policies to pay for their funeral ( Return of the pauper's funeral, G2, 21 October). My mother had told us we would not have to bear the expense of her funeral as she had two life insurance policies, which included one taken out by her mother in 1924. She died 10 years ago aged 93, and her funeral cost us around &pound;3,500; the insurance policies paid out &pound;80 and &pound;120 respectively. So much for prudent planning. Mabel TaylorKnutsford, Cheshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; I told my stepmother, a dressmaker, and a very good one, who was very fussy about her appearance, that I belonged to a profession that&nbsp;didn't judge people by the way they&nbsp;dress ( Why do academics dress so&nbsp;badly, 21 October). &quot;Well, they ought to,&quot; she snapped back.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guatemala, Pakistan, Indonesia, Haiti. Four different nations that share a common experience: in the past decade, they were all struck by natural disasters which overwhelmed their under-staffed and under-funded public health systems. Into the rubble, flooding, and chaos of these distinct cultures and contexts, Cuba dispatched a specialised disaster and epidemic control team to support local health providers. It was a story of unprecedented medical solidarity by a developing country which few media outlets picked up - until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Henry Reeve Brigade, as it's known, was established in 2005 by more than 1,500 Cuban health professionals trained in disaster medicine and infectious disease containment; built on 40 years of medical aid experience, the volunteer team was outfitted with essential medicines and equipment and prepared to deploy to US regions ravaged by Hurricane Katrina ( the offer was rejected by the Bush administration ). Today, Cuba's Henry Reeve Brigade is the largest medical team on the ground in west Africa battling Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The small island nation has pledged 461 doctors and nurses to provide care in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, the largest single-country offer of healthcare workers to date. While United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon decried the pallid aid commitment from around the globe calling for &quot;a 20-fold resource mobilisation and at least a 20-fold surge in assistance&quot; Cuba already had 165 of these specially-trained healthcare workers on the ground in Sierra Leone. Each of these volunteers, chosen from a pool of 15,000 candidates who stepped forward to serve in west Africa, has extensive disaster response experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, preparation for this mission required additional, rigorous training at Havana's Pedro Kour&iacute; Institute of Tropical Medicine with biosecurity experts from the United States and the Pan American Health Organisation. This rapid mobilisation of sorely-needed health professionals begs the question: how can a poor developing country spare qualified, experienced doctors and nurses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By pursuing a robust medical education strategy, coupled with a preventive, community-based approach, Cuba, a country of just 11.2 million inhabitants, has achieved a health picture on par with the world's most developed nations. This didn't happen overnight. Rather, Cuba's admirable health report card results from decades of honing a strategy designed specifically for a resource-scarce setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By locating primary care doctors in neighbourhoods and emphasising disease prevention, the health system - which is universal and free at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels - makes care accessible and keeps people as healthy as possible, as long as possible, saving resources for more expensive treatments and interventions in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prevention and health promotion by community-based healthcare workers are only part of the story. Cuba's policies and practices, both at home and abroad (currently more than 50,000 Cuban health professionals are serving in 66 countries) are built on several principles proven effective in resource-scarce settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, coordinating health policies at the local, regional, and national levels is essential; this is particularly important where infectious diseases are concerned since uniform protocols are integral to containment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, health initiatives must be cross-sectoral and based on integrated messages and actions. A fragmented, uncoordinated response by and among different agencies can prove dangerous and even deadly. This was tragically illustrated by the death of Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas and the US Centers for Disease Control allowing a nurse who has Ebola to travel on a commercial flight. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, infectious disease outbreaks must be addressed quickly - easier said than done in poor settings, where public health systems are already strained or collapsing already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak snaps the need for Cuba's approach into sharp relief: only a coordinated response, provided by well-trained and - equipped primary healthcare professionals will contain this - and future - epidemics. Indeed, policymakers such as World Health Organisation's Margaret Chan and US secretary of state John Kerry have lauded the Cuban response, underscoring the importance of collaboration as the only solution to this global health crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forging this solution, however, requires harnessing the political will across borders and agencies to marshal resources and know-how. Havana took up the challenge by hosting a special Summit on Ebola with its regional partners and global health authorities on 20 October. Noticeably absent were US health representatives; if we're to construct a comprehensive, integrated, and effective global response, all resources and experiences must be coordinated and brought to bear, regardless of political differences. Anything less and Ebola wins.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European commission, has rejected out of hand any attempt by David Cameron to &quot;destroy&quot; the fundamental rules of the EU on free movement of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an echo of the remarks by the outgoing president Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, who warned that the prime minister is making a &quot;historic mistake&quot; on the EU, Juncker said on Wednesday that he would not compromise in an &quot;irresponsible way&quot; on rights that date back to foundation of the EEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention by Juncker, at the European parliament in Strasbourg, as MEPs approved the appointment of his new commission team, came as a new poll showed growing support among UK voters for continuing membership of the EU.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ipsos Mori poll, commissioned by the London Evening Standard, found that 56% of voters would support UK membership while 36% would vote to leave if a referendum were held now. The poll shows support for the EU has risen since the issue returned to centre stage with the rise of Ukip after the PM suggested in the summer of 2012 that he would support a referendum on EU membership. In November 2012, five months after Cameron floated the idea of a referendum and two months before he formally committed himself to one, Ipsos Mori found 48% of voters would like to leave the EU while 44% would support membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest poll is a mixed blessing for pro-Europeans. It shows that 43% of voters either broadly support Britain's EU membership terms (29%) or support the idea of the UK joining with other member states for closer integration (14%). But the poll also found that 51% of voters want Britain to be a member of an economic community with no political links (34%) or would like to leave the EU altogether (17%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juncker said he would like to help secure a &quot;fair deal&quot; with Cameron if he were to put a package of reforms to EU leaders after a general election win. But the incoming commission president brushed aside recent suggestions from government sources that restrictions should be imposed on migrants from current EU states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference at the European parliament, Juncker said: &quot;As far as the freedom of movement is concerned... I do think this is a basic principle of the EU since the very beginning and I am not prepared to change this because if we are destroying the freedom of movement other freedoms will fall in a later cause. So I am not ready to compromise in an irresponsible way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Juncker said that any EU leader was free to table proposals to the European Council - the body that comprises the leaders of the 28 EU member states. He added: &quot;We want a fair deal with Britain and it has to be seen how far reaching the compromises can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not in a situation to tell you exactly what the British government will propose and so I am not in a position to tell you what the European commission will deliver as an answer to a British request. But this is not as dramatic a question as it seems. Believe me, it is not as dramatic as it seems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron is expecting to face questions about his reform plans on the margins on an EU summit in Brussels today and on Friday which will formally discuss climate change, economic growth, the Ebola crisis and Ukraine. Herman Van Rompuy, the outgoing European Council president, has said that he would like EU leaders to agree to cut the EU's carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron is planning to shame fellow EU leaders over their dinner on Thursday night into stepping up their response to the Ebola crisis by ensuring that the combined contribution of all 28 EU member states amounts to (EURO)1bn and that 2,000 workers are sent to west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has contributed &pound;125m ((EURO)156m) to its former colony Sierra Leone. The prime minister will say that Britain is contributing (EURO)40m ahead of the EU's largest economy, Germany, four times more than France and 50 times more than Spain, which &quot;with the cases they have had in Madrid have got a real experience of the challenges presented by Ebola&quot;. The total amount pledged by EU states so far amounts to (EURO)750m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alisdair McIntosh, director of Business for New Europe, said of the new poll: &quot;Many of the public recognise the important economic benefits of staying within the EU. Politicians are mistaken if they think people just want to hear ever-louder Eurosceptic rhetoric, especially at a time of economic and political uncertainty. This only increases cynicism about the major political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians need to lead from the front, not shout from the back. They need to set the agenda, and reflect the importance of EU membership to business and the economy. The way to promote prosperity in Britain is to secure realistic reforms of the EU. The government should fight for the reforms that matter most - those that will create growth and jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; This article was amended on 23 October 2014. An earlier version said incorrectly that the Ipsos Mori poll published this week was commissioned by the pro-EU Business for New Europe group.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abbott: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 Canadians are believed to be fighting with the ISIL death cult and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and more have been infected with godless fanaticism. So, Madam Speaker, today, more than ever, Australians and Canadians are family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We feel Canada's shock, pain and anger. I have been in their parliament, I have been at their War Memorial - so many of us have.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says, in essence, the government is not prepared to deploy teams into the region until he's certain there are contingency plans in place to get them out should circumstances require that.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's deputy leader Tanya Plibersekis on to the Coalition's lack of prompt response to requests from Washington and London regarding the deployment of health teams to fight ebola at the source of the outbreak. Plibersekhas just been interviewed on ABC24. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Does it surprise you that we've had confirmation that we have had these official requests from the United Kingdom, United States amongst others, but this agreement as far as the evacuation of Australian personnel hasn't been sorted out? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plibersek: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's very significant that we've had the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the president of the United States make formal requests of our government for extra Australian commitment to fight ebola in West Africa and those requests haven't been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are two of our most important allies. They are bearing a huge share of the responsibility of fighting ebola in West Africa. We've now got a situation where the president of the United States is ringing the prime minister of Australia. The prime minister of the UK has spoken to our foreign minister and still the Australian government is not making arrangements to support Australian personnel who are trained, who are willing, who are able to fight ebola in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A bit of context and joining dots. Thus far the government has indicated it does not want, in a formal sense, to deploy health workers to West Africa. Australian volunteers are already in the region. The leaks about Morrisonbeing overly expansive over the past 24 hours relate to the government's management of the ebola issue. A poll this week suggested Australians weren't overly enamoured with the idea of the government sending health teams into West Africa.) </SPAN></P>

We continue to assess all available information to determine what action, if any, may be required in Australia. We also continue to work closely with state and federal police to monitor activity at, and in the vicinity of defence locations. This is not the time for alarm but we should not be complacent about our personal safety.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: You have just said 'heightened threat level'. Have we actually established what the threat level is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: The heightened national threat level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: Can I confirm that the Parliament House threat level has not changed since 2010? Is that correct? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: That is correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: So there has been no heightened threat assessment for Parliament House? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: And what is that threat level, please-or however we describe it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: Senator, I do not think we should-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It was asked previously by the President when he was a senator and answered. You might want to reconsider your position on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: We will check that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: If that is the case, we certainly will answer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: As the President would know, I do not ask questions that go to impinge on security matters in the sense of in any way having a negative impact on the safety and security of people who work in this building-or anywhere else, for that matter. But this has been answered before. We have a situation more broadly in the community, as you know, where the threat level has been raised. But, if it is an issue now, someone might care to explain why-which is fair enough, but please explain it, because it is something that has been in the public arena previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: As I said, if I can confirm that I will certainly answer it, but I guess our general approach to security matters relating to the building is not, in a public forum, to speak about the detail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It is. There is a DPS circular that I have in front of me resulting from Mr President, before he was Mr President, in the 2009-10 additional estimates asking a question about threat level. A circular was issued by DPS-I am afraid I only have the first page-and it has at paragraph 2 under 'Background': 'Parliament House has been assessed by the National Threat Assessment Centre within ASIO as being at medium threat level.' It was a public document. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: I can confirm that we continue to receive advice from ASIO and that at this point in time the threat level has not changed from that advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: Take my question in relation to the threat level on notice, if you would not mind, and I will totally accept, Mr President, if there is a security implication of actually using the nomenclature, then best explain that to the committee. I am sure all committee members would accept it. Why is it though-this is something I do not understand-that the national threat level has been increased from medium to high in recent times-I think we are all aware of that-and there has been no change to the threat level at Parliament House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: That would be a question for ASIO, I would suggest. We do not have the information available to us that the intelligence agencies do have upon which they base their assessments. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretty odd old place right now, the national security committee of Cabinet. Odd when the defence minister doesn't attend meetings when the government is in the process of settling legal authority for a special forces deployment in Iraq - and explains his absence with an overly frank reflection that his presence wouldn't add much. Refreshing, I find Johnstonquite refreshing with his regular truth bombs actually - but.. odd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Daniel Hurst writes this morning that Australia's defence minister, David Johnston, did not attend cabinet's national security committee (NSC) on Wednesday because he &quot;wasn't going to add too much&quot; to the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnston, whose position as defence minister is often said to be under threat, instead continued with a scheduled appearance before a Senate estimates hearing. By contrast, the defence force chief, Mark Binskin, and the secretary of the defence department, Dennis Richardson, delayed their attendance at the Senate hearing so they could participate in NSC deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 8.19am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to addressing questions about the Ottawa shooting this morning, the foreign minister was asked about a story we referenced briefly yesterday on Politics Live - colleagues have been a bit surly about what's being characterised as a power grab by the immigration minister Scott Morrison- surly enough to leak to journalists. The word is Morrisonwants to grab quarantine powers for his border security empire. It's pretty clear that the agriculture minister Barnaby Joycewould like Captain Cronulla to stick to asylum boats. The fight is playing out around the policy responses to the ebola outbreak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishopwas asked about the scrap, and played a very dead bat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've had a number of discussions in our National Security Committee about Australia's response to the ebola outbreak in West Africa. We have been discussing this on a regular basis for some time. We are still in negotiations with other countries about how Australian health workers could be evacuated or treated should they be working in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're providing funding to the United Nations, to front line services , in fact the United Nations has praised Australia's quick and immediate response to provide funding. So there's a very detailed process that we're going through across government and we'll continue to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morrisonhimself is on the radio now. He suggests colleagues bitching about him is a media beat up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are hyperventilating a bit about this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: One of your colleagues says you're using ebola as a Trojan Horse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's just conspiracy nonsense.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning everyone and welcome to the last sitting day of the parliamentary week. The prime minister as you can see from our opening picture on Politics Live this morning has been up and about early conforming with public health guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning news cycle is dominated thus far by events in Canada: if you are just connecting to the outside world, a soldier has been shot, and a gunman has opened fire on the Canadian parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I came into the office this morning I passed the foreign minister Julie Bishopin the corridor, doing the rounds of breakfast television. The justice minister Michael Keenanhas been on the ABC, and was asked about security in the Australian parliament given the incident in Ottawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary officials gave evidence before a senate estimates hearing earlier this week that the threat level at parliament house had not been adjusted since 2010, despite the very obvious deployment in recent weeks of heavily armed federal police around the forecourt and the ministerial entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keenan: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've taken all necessary measures to make sure this building is secure. People coming to work here, or coming to visit here, should feel very confident about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Have there been any recent threats to parliament house? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, there's nothing specific that we are aware of that would give us specific cause for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Have any extra precautions been taken this morning? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be an enhanced AFP presence around the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishophas a similar message for the TV networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no specific threat against parliament house here. We have had increased security arrange minutes for some time, but in relation to the incident in Canada, obviously security arrangements there will be increased substantially as a result of this dreadful incident that has occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots more issues to get across, of course. The Politics Live comments threat is open and ready for your input. If you'd prefer to have a conversation elsewhere, I'm  @murpharoo and the man with the camera is  @mpbowers</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers in Liberia are too frightened to work together in their fields, fertilisers and seeds are stuck on the other side of closed borders, markets are almost empty, people have less money because jobs that involve physical contact with others are disappearing, and prices for everything from cassava to palm oil are rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a devastating chain reaction sparked by an unprecedented outbreak of disease in one of the world's poorest countries. Beyond the high mortality rate and human suffering, aid agencies fear the fabric of a society that endured a brutal civil conflict may be ruined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten months after the Ebola outbreak started in Guinea, evidence is mounting that the crisis may be reversing more than a decade of fitful progress in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon O'Connell, regional director for aid group Mercy Corps, says that despite several years of 6%-8% growth and significant development gains, Liberia's gross domestic product per capita is still only about $450, below prewar levels in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's taken that entire period, from the war ending in 2003, to just about get back to those prewar levels,&quot; he said. &quot;Then we see the price spikes, this disruption in access to markets, and also the breaking down of social fabrics, the trust between communities, between different demographics and between communities and governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ... trying to ensure that this outbreak doesn't undermine development gains and, of course, there is a risk of that the longer the crisis plays out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before this crisis, Liberia was rebuilding after 14 years of civil wars, between 1989-2003. More than 250,000 people were killed in the conflict. Reconstruction was slow: before the Ebola outbreak, the country had only about 50 doctors for a population of more than 4 million. Now, even that progress has been threatened because of a disease that has killed more than 2,400 Liberians (pdf).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercy Corps, which has been in Liberia since 2002, has carried out an assessment of households and markets in Liberia's remote Lofa and Nimba counties, and around the capital, Monrovia. It found that 55% of households have seen a reduction in incomes, 60% have higher expenses, and nearly half are eating fewer meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fewer trucks on the road - either because they are unable to travel during the 11pm-6am curfew or because drivers do not want to venture into remote areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mercy Corps found rice prices had risen by about 20% while commodities such as palm oil had risen by up to 50% in Monrovia. These findings are echoed by other agencies: the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation says cassava prices have risen by about 150%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shenggen Fan, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, says smaller harvests are expected for both staple and cash crops because of quarantined zones and restrictions on movement in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These disruptions in production, labour markets and trade/transportation have serious implications for food security and nutrition of poor and vulnerable groups,&quot; Fan said. &quot;Poor people spend a large proportion - about 50%-70% - of their income on food, so rapid increases in the prices of staple foods harm them by reducing their ... access to food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The health impacts of Ebola are devastating. But without prompt action by national governments and the international community, Ebola can trigger a food crisis that may persist beyond the disease's lifecycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has changed the way people farm in Liberia. &quot;One of the major changes is that the kuus agricultural labour system is not functioning as it was previously. This is a pooling of labour and it used to [involve] between 30 and 50 people. It is now being reduced to smaller groups, between five and 10 people. This has led to a significant reduction in agricultural production,&quot; said O'Connell. &quot;It's a sort of spiralling effect overall, which is compounding the situation.&quot; The famine early warning systems network, Fewsnet, has said about 1.3 million people could need emergency food aid from January (pdf) in the three countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears are rising that the disease, and the attendant social upheaval, could lead to unrest in countries where a large proportion of the population is young and unemployed. In a September briefing note, the International Crisis Group said the health crisis risked becoming a political crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adding social breakdown to the epidemic would create disaster perhaps impossible to manage,&quot; it said. &quot;The Ebola epidemic has exposed citizens' lack of trust in their governments and the grave potential for deep unrest in these already fragile societies. In all three countries, past civil conflicts fuelled by local and regional antagonisms could resurface.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US officials are also worried about food insecurity. &quot;We have Fewsnet tracking key indicators like market prices, the price of staples and the ability to get to market. These are all factors that are contributing to rising food insecurity and for that reason, not only are we responding to controlling the outbreak but also looking - through the World Food Programme [WFP] and others - at how to address food security,&quot; said Nancy Lindborg, USAid's assistant administrator for the bureau for democracy, conflict and humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While food shortages are an issue, people's inability to afford food because of declining purchasing power is also a problem, said Alexis Masciarelli, WFP's regional spokesman. &quot;What's important is not so much the prices. It's more the purchasing power [of households] ... Plantations have closed, mines are closed, schools have closed and there is no investment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberia remains one of poorest countries in the world, with tremendous needs ... this is a humanitarian crisis on an unprecedented scale,&quot; said O'Connell. &quot;Much more mobilisation is needed in a much more multilateral way, much quicker so we can respond at speed and at scale.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybercriminals are using the current Ebola outbreak as a topical hook for spam emails that can install malware giving them remote access to computers, including logging key presses, capturing video from webcams and stealing passwords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online Security firm Trustwave's SpiderLabs team of ethical hackers published details of the scam yesterday, noting that emails pretend to be from the World Health Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The information and prevention listed in the attached file will help you and those around you stay safe,&quot; claims one email published on SpiderLabs' blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an outbreak of Ebola and other diseases around that you know nothing about. Download the World Health Organization file for more information on how to stay safe from Ebola and other preventable diseases. We care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, the creators of the email care about installing something called the &quot;DarkComet Remote Access Trojan&quot; which can run on computers &quot;undetected by antivirus software&quot; according to SpiderLabs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here comes the caveat: there's no evidence yet that this particular spam campaign is a serious threat. &quot;We've only seen one sample from this campaign so far. At this time we don't have reason to believe it is a widespread campaign,&quot; notes SpiderLabs' blog post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The address it was sent to was an old honeypot address, so it's not exactly targeted either. These facts taken together suggest a low volume campaign (sent to whatever address list the spammer is using) in an attempt to infect random users in the hope of gaining some data that can be used or sold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more important point, though, is that any topical news event is fuel for cybercriminals, so any unexpected email in your inbox about Ebola should be treated with caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SpiderLabs points to another campaign is pretending to offer advice from the Mexican government about Ebola prevention, for example.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> here's a scary story bouncing around Facebook, accruing hundreds of thousands of likes: the small town of Purdon, Texas, has been quarantined after a family of five was diagnosed with Ebola. The story is a total hoax, put out by a deeply cynical site called the National Report. But to the 340,000 people who saw it pop up in their news feed, it looked real enough to share. &quot;We've seen stories on satire sites - fake news sites - getting tremendous traction because they feed on people's fears,&quot; says Craig Silverman, the founder of Emergent.Info. &quot;It's really becoming an epidemic now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's satire, and then there's plain crap. Emergent, though, is neither - it's truly useful.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Bank of America refunds duplicate Apple Pay charges &gt;&gt; Cult of Mac</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [Samuel] Burke [at CNN] reports that he eventually got the charges refunded once Bank of America noticed&nbsp;they were obviously duplicate charges of the same amount. Other customers haven't had as easy time getting a refund, but Bank of America says they're aware of the issue and working on a fix. Bank of America representative Tara Burke told Cult of Mac, &quot;We apologize for this inconvenience. We're correcting this issue immediately.&quot; She also reassured us that &quot;all duplicates will be refunded&quot; to Apple Pay customers. Apple Pay launched on Monday with the release of iOS 8.1, allowing iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users to pay for items at brick and mortar stores by tapping their device to an NFC terminal. The launch wasn't without its glitches, as some of the Apple Pay supporting apps had problems processing payments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problem apparently limited to Bank of America - but it's the sort of problem that can kill a system if it isn't figured out quickly.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Trim Enabler and Yosemite &gt;&gt; Cindori</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trim Enabler was a useful app to enable third-party SSDs on Macs using older versions of Mac OS X. But:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), Apple has introduced a new security requirement called kext signing. (A kext is a kernel extension, or a driver, in Mac OS X) Kext signing basically works by checking if all the drivers in the system are unaltered by a third party, or approved by Apple. If they have been modified, Yosemite will no longer load the driver. This is a means of enforcing security, but also a way for Apple to control what hardware that third party developers can release OS X support for. Since Trim Enabler works by unlocking the Trim driver for 3rd party SSD's, this security setting prevents Trim Enabler to enable Trim on Yosemite. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not good news if you've got a third-party SSD drive - which has for years been one of the best ways to &quot;refresh&quot; an older machine. Beware.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sony looking to cut smartphone sales target again &gt;&gt; WSJ</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Takashi Mochizuki:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sony is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday, as the business struggles to perform as expected in the face of fierce competition especially in emerging markets. The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43m for the 12 months to the end of March 2015. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50m, which many analysts said was too optimistic... The planned move stems from Sony's plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem then becomes whether it can maintain sufficient scale at a high enough selling price to make the business worth continuing with. The writedown in September was of the mobile unit's estimated profit over its lifetime. Cutting sales forecasts is a lot more urgent.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">We're moving your data! &gt;&gt; Hugo Barra of Xiaomi</SPAN><BR></P>

As a global Internet company, we really care about speed and we're also fully committed to storing our users' data securely at all times. In early 2014, we kicked off a massive internal effort to expand our server infrastructure globally in order to better serve Mi fans everywhere. Our primary goal in moving to a multi-site server architecture was to improve the performance of our services for Mi fans around the world, cut down latency and reduce failure rates. At the same time, it also better equips us to maintain high privacy standards and comply with local data protection regulations. This is a very high priority for Xiaomi as we expand into new markets over the next few years. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ex-NFL player and longtime videogame player Chris Kluwe:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So many people are playing games now that they are popular culture. They are not going away. All sorts of cool things, that I like, are now things that a whole bunch of other people like! There's enough space now for people to make games that are strange and disturbing and maybe highlight a different perspective of the world, because gaming is no longer a niche activity, it's something that everybody does. There is room for art in video games. That's awesome! </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third party media (music and videos) storage and playback&nbsp;used to be the main job that storage was hired to do but as cameras got better, user-generated content suddenly bellied up to the bar. That is now the story for phones, which are gobbling up all the storage and bandwidth we can throw at them. But what about the larger form factors? Are iPads (and laptops) growing in their demands? Paradoxically, it would seem that the smaller devices are hungrier than their larger cousins. The answer lies&nbsp;with the jobs to be done. If highly portable devices are more usable, they will be used more. Large devices are left behind, literally, because their jobs are not as pervasive in place and time. For a large screen like the iPad to increase its&nbsp;attractiveness, it has to be the stage for a set of jobs that only it can perform. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Apple Pay: seamless in stores, but quirky online &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com</SPAN><BR></P>

The same can't be said for using Apple Pay to shop via apps on my phone or tablet. That system has lots of room for improvement. It's limited, still buggy and seemed to result in multiple charges for some purchases - at least on day 1. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Does it surprise you that we've had confirmation that we have had these official requests from the United Kingdom, United States amongst others, but this agreement as far as the evacuation of Australian personnel hasn't been sorted out? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plibersek: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's very significant that we've had the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the president of the United States make formal requests of our government for extra Australian commitment to fight ebola in West Africa and those requests haven't been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are two of our most important allies. They are bearing a huge share of the responsibility of fighting ebola in West Africa. We've now got a situation where the president of the United States is ringing the prime minister of Australia. The prime minister of the UK has spoken to our foreign minister and still the Australian government is not making arrangements to support Australian personnel who are trained, who are willing, who are able to fight ebola in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A bit of context and joining dots. Thus far the government has indicated it does not want, in a formal sense, to deploy health workers to West Africa. Australian volunteers are already in the region. The leaks about Morrisonbeing overly expansive over the past 24 hours relate to the government's management of the ebola issue. A poll this week suggested Australians weren't overly enamoured with the idea of the government sending health teams into West Africa.) </SPAN></P>

Please be assured that defence and other Australian security agencies are actively monitoring developments in Canada and more broadly around the world. We continue to assess all available information to determine what action, if any, may be required in Australia. We also continue to work closely with state and federal police to monitor activity at, and in the vicinity of defence locations. This is not the time for alarm but we should not be complacent about our personal safety. As I have said before, think about where you're going, be aware of your surroundings, and exercise commonsense and judgement when considering where and when to wear your uniform in public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the events of today - worth reposting estimates evidence from Monday about the threat level at parliament house. The Ms Millsin this transcript is Carol Mills, head of DPS, and the Mr Skillis a DPS colleague. The folks asking the questions are Labor senators Penny Wongand John Faulkner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Carol Mills at senate estimates in Parliament House, Monday 20th October 2014 Photograph: Mike Bowers/Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: You have just said 'heightened threat level'. Have we actually established what the threat level is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: The heightened national threat level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: Can I confirm that the Parliament House threat level has not changed since 2010? Is that correct? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: That is correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: So there has been no heightened threat assessment for Parliament House? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: And what is that threat level, please-or however we describe it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: Senator, I do not think we should-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It was asked previously by the President when he was a senator and answered. You might want to reconsider your position on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: We will check that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: If that is the case, we certainly will answer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: As the President would know, I do not ask questions that go to impinge on security matters in the sense of in any way having a negative impact on the safety and security of people who work in this building-or anywhere else, for that matter. But this has been answered before. We have a situation more broadly in the community, as you know, where the threat level has been raised. But, if it is an issue now, someone might care to explain why-which is fair enough, but please explain it, because it is something that has been in the public arena previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: As I said, if I can confirm that I will certainly answer it, but I guess our general approach to security matters relating to the building is not, in a public forum, to speak about the detail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It is. There is a DPS circular that I have in front of me resulting from Mr President, before he was Mr President, in the 2009-10 additional estimates asking a question about threat level. A circular was issued by DPS-I am afraid I only have the first page-and it has at paragraph 2 under 'Background': 'Parliament House has been assessed by the National Threat Assessment Centre within ASIO as being at medium threat level.' It was a public document. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: I can confirm that we continue to receive advice from ASIO and that at this point in time the threat level has not changed from that advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: Take my question in relation to the threat level on notice, if you would not mind, and I will totally accept, Mr President, if there is a security implication of actually using the nomenclature, then best explain that to the committee. I am sure all committee members would accept it. Why is it though-this is something I do not understand-that the national threat level has been increased from medium to high in recent times-I think we are all aware of that-and there has been no change to the threat level at Parliament House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: That would be a question for ASIO, I would suggest. We do not have the information available to us that the intelligence agencies do have upon which they base their assessments. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are in Gough country, I enjoyed a column this morning in The Australian from former journalist and political staffer Nikki Savva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone who encountered him has favourite anecdotes. There is another from that day at old Parliament House. Afterwards in Kings Hall, I asked Gough if I could have my photo taken with him. Of course. Media had been full of allegations of sexual harassment against a NSW Liberal minister, which I assumed prompted Gough to ask if he could put his arm around my shoulder. There was I thinking how endearingly old-fashioned, gentlemanly, he was to seek my permission. Yes, I said. Then just as photographer Mike Bowers was about to click, Gough whispered, sotto voce: &quot;Hold on a moment while I adjust my left testicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should be clearer with the attribution on the Morrisonfracas. The news report I referenced yesterday on Politics Live was from Phil Cooreyof The Australian Financial Review. The story that has prompted the various responses this morning is from the ABC's Andrew Greene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration minister Scott Morrison is pushing for his Operation Sovereign Borders team to take control of Australia's ebola response with new powers to force visitors from West Africa to be isolated in quarantine. The ABC can reveal the ambitious plan as the nation's state and federal chief medical officers meet today to discuss the response to the deadly virus. Mr Morrison let his colleagues know he believed he and his department could take on a larger role in responding to the ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 8.31am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks in the building tell me the police have made a call to the office of the House Speaker, Bronwyn Bishop. I'll make a call when time permits to see what, if anything, is being said about that. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretty odd old place right now, the national security committee of Cabinet. Odd when the defence minister doesn't attend meetings when the government is in the process of settling legal authority for a special forces deployment in Iraq - and explains his absence with an overly frank reflection that his presence wouldn't add much. Refreshing, I find Johnstonquite refreshing with his regular truth bombs actually - but.. odd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Daniel Hurst writes this morning that Australia's defence minister, David Johnston, did not attend cabinet's national security committee (NSC) on Wednesday because he &quot;wasn't going to add too much&quot; to the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnston, whose position as defence minister is often said to be under threat, instead continued with a scheduled appearance before a Senate estimates hearing. By contrast, the defence force chief, Mark Binskin, and the secretary of the defence department, Dennis Richardson, delayed their attendance at the Senate hearing so they could participate in NSC deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 8.19am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to addressing questions about the Ottawa shooting this morning, the foreign minister was asked about a story we referenced briefly yesterday on Politics Live - colleagues have been a bit surly about what's being characterised as a power grab by the immigration minister Scott Morrison- surly enough to leak to journalists. The word is Morrisonwants to grab quarantine powers for his border security empire. It's pretty clear that the agriculture minister Barnaby Joycewould like Captain Cronulla to stick to asylum boats. The fight is playing out around the policy responses to the ebola outbreak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishopwas asked about the scrap, and played a very dead bat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've had a number of discussions in our National Security Committee about Australia's response to the ebola outbreak in West Africa. We have been discussing this on a regular basis for some time. We are still in negotiations with other countries about how Australian health workers could be evacuated or treated should they be working in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're providing funding to the United Nations, to front line services , in fact the United Nations has praised Australia's quick and immediate response to provide funding. So there's a very detailed process that we're going through across government and we'll continue to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morrisonhimself is on the radio now. He suggests colleagues bitching about him is a media beat up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning news cycle is dominated thus far by events in Canada: if you are just connecting to the outside world, a soldier has been shot, and a gunman has opened fire on the Canadian parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I came into the office this morning I passed the foreign minister Julie Bishopin the corridor, doing the rounds of breakfast television. The justice minister Michael Keenanhas been on the ABC, and was asked about security in the Australian parliament given the incident in Ottawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary officials gave evidence before a senate estimates hearing earlier this week that the threat level at parliament house had not been adjusted since 2010, despite the very obvious deployment in recent weeks of heavily armed federal police around the forecourt and the ministerial entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keenan: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've taken all necessary measures to make sure this building is secure. People coming to work here, or coming to visit here, should feel very confident about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Have there been any recent threats to parliament house? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, there's nothing specific that we are aware of that would give us specific cause for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Have any extra precautions been taken this morning? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be an enhanced AFP presence around the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishophas a similar message for the TV networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no specific threat against parliament house here. We have had increased security arrange minutes for some time, but in relation to the incident in Canada, obviously security arrangements there will be increased substantially as a result of this dreadful incident that has occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots more issues to get across, of course. The Politics Live comments threat is open and ready for your input. If you'd prefer to have a conversation elsewhere, I'm  @murpharoo and the man with the camera is  @mpbowers</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's deputy leader Tanya Plibersekis on to the Coalition's lack of prompt response to requests from Washington and London concerning health teams to fight ebola at the source of the outbreak. Plibersekhas just been interviewed on ABC24. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Does it surprise you that we've had confirmation that we have had these official requests from the United Kingdom, United States amongst others, but this agreement as far as the evacuation of Australian personnel hasn't been sorted out? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plibersek: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's very significant that we've had the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the president of the United States make formal requests of our government for extra Australian commitment to fight ebola in West Africa and those requests haven't been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are two of our most important allies. They are bearing a huge share of the responsibility of fighting ebola in West Africa. We've now got a situation where the president of the United States is ringing the prime minister of Australia. The prime minister of the UK has spoken to our foreign minister and still the Australian government is not making arrangements to support Australian personnel who are trained, who are willing, who are able to fight ebola in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A bit of context and joining dots. Thus far the government has indicated it does not want, in a formal sense, to deploy health workers to West Africa. Australian volunteers are already in the region. The leaks about Morrisonbeing overly expansive over the past 24 hours relate to the government's management of the ebola issue. A poll this week suggested Australians weren't overly enamoured with the idea of the government sending health teams into West Africa.) </SPAN></P>

Please be assured that defence and other Australian security agencies are actively monitoring developments in Canada and more broadly around the world. We continue to assess all available information to determine what action, if any, may be required in Australia. We also continue to work closely with state and federal police to monitor activity at, and in the vicinity of defence locations. This is not the time for alarm but we should not be complacent about our personal safety. As I have said before, think about where you're going, be aware of your surroundings, and exercise commonsense and judgement when considering where and when to wear your uniform in public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Carol Mills at senate estimates in Parliament House, Monday 20th October 2014 Photograph: Mike Bowers/Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: You have just said 'heightened threat level'. Have we actually established what the threat level is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: The heightened national threat level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: Can I confirm that the Parliament House threat level has not changed since 2010? Is that correct? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: That is correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: So there has been no heightened threat assessment for Parliament House? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: And what is that threat level, please-or however we describe it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: Senator, I do not think we should-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It was asked previously by the President when he was a senator and answered. You might want to reconsider your position on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: We will check that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: If that is the case, we certainly will answer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: As the President would know, I do not ask questions that go to impinge on security matters in the sense of in any way having a negative impact on the safety and security of people who work in this building-or anywhere else, for that matter. But this has been answered before. We have a situation more broadly in the community, as you know, where the threat level has been raised. But, if it is an issue now, someone might care to explain why-which is fair enough, but please explain it, because it is something that has been in the public arena previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: As I said, if I can confirm that I will certainly answer it, but I guess our general approach to security matters relating to the building is not, in a public forum, to speak about the detail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It is. There is a DPS circular that I have in front of me resulting from Mr President, before he was Mr President, in the 2009-10 additional estimates asking a question about threat level. A circular was issued by DPS-I am afraid I only have the first page-and it has at paragraph 2 under 'Background': 'Parliament House has been assessed by the National Threat Assessment Centre within ASIO as being at medium threat level.' It was a public document. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: I can confirm that we continue to receive advice from ASIO and that at this point in time the threat level has not changed from that advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: Take my question in relation to the threat level on notice, if you would not mind, and I will totally accept, Mr President, if there is a security implication of actually using the nomenclature, then best explain that to the committee. I am sure all committee members would accept it. Why is it though-this is something I do not understand-that the national threat level has been increased from medium to high in recent times-I think we are all aware of that-and there has been no change to the threat level at Parliament House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: That would be a question for ASIO, I would suggest. We do not have the information available to us that the intelligence agencies do have upon which they base their assessments. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are in Gough country, I enjoyed a column this morning in The Australian from former journalist and political staffer Nikki Savva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone who encountered him has favourite anecdotes. There is another from that day at old Parliament House. Afterwards in Kings Hall, I asked Gough if I could have my photo taken with him. Of course. Media had been full of allegations of sexual harassment against a NSW Liberal minister, which I assumed prompted Gough to ask if he could put his arm around my shoulder. There was I thinking how endearingly old-fashioned, gentlemanly, he was to seek my permission. Yes, I said. Then just as photographer Mike Bowers was about to click, Gough whispered, sotto voce: &quot;Hold on a moment while I adjust my left testicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should be clearer with the attribution on the Morrisonfracas. The news report I referenced yesterday on Politics Live was from Phil Cooreyof The Australian Financial Review. The story that has prompted the various responses this morning is from the ABC's Andrew Greene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration minister Scott Morrison is pushing for his Operation Sovereign Borders team to take control of Australia's ebola response with new powers to force visitors from West Africa to be isolated in quarantine. The ABC can reveal the ambitious plan as the nation's state and federal chief medical officers meet today to discuss the response to the deadly virus. Mr Morrison let his colleagues know he believed he and his department could take on a larger role in responding to the ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretty odd old place right now, the national security committee of Cabinet. Odd when the defence minister doesn't attend meetings when the government is in the process of settling legal authority for a special forces deployment in Iraq - and explains his absence with an overly frank reflection that his presence wouldn't add much. Refreshing, I find Johnstonquite refreshing with his regular truth bombs actually - but.. odd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Daniel Hurst writes this morning that Australia's defence minister, David Johnston, did not attend cabinet's national security committee (NSC) on Wednesday because he &quot;wasn't going to add too much&quot; to the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnston, whose position as defence minister is often said to be under threat, instead continued with a scheduled appearance before a Senate estimates hearing. By contrast, the defence force chief, Mark Binskin, and the secretary of the defence department, Dennis Richardson, delayed their attendance at the Senate hearing so they could participate in NSC deliberations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to addressing questions about the Ottawa shooting this morning, the foreign minister was asked about a story we referenced briefly yesterday on Politics Live - colleagues have been a bit surly about what's being characterised as a power grab by the immigration minister Scott Morrison- surly enough to leak to journalists. The word is Morrisonwants to grab quarantine powers for his border security empire. It's pretty clear that the agriculture minister Barnaby Joycewould like Captain Cronulla to stick to asylum boats. The fight is playing out around the policy responses to the ebola outbreak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishopwas asked about the scrap, and played a very dead bat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've had a number of discussions in our National Security Committee about Australia's response to the ebola outbreak in West Africa. We have been discussing this on a regular basis for some time. We are still in negotiations with other countries about how Australian health workers could be evacuated or treated should they be working in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're providing funding to the United Nations, to front line services , in fact the United Nations has praised Australia's quick and immediate response to provide funding. So there's a very detailed process that we're going through across government and we'll continue to do that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning news cycle is dominated thus far by events in Canada: if you are just connecting to the outside world, a soldier has been shot, and a gunman has opened fire on the Canadian parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I came into the office this morning I passed the foreign minister Julie Bishopin the corridor, doing the rounds of breakfast television. The justice minister Michael Keenanhas been on the ABC, and was asked about security in the Australian parliament given the incident in Ottawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary officials gave evidence before a senate estimates hearing earlier this week that the threat level at parliament house had not been adjusted since 2010, despite the very obvious deployment in recent weeks of heavily armed federal police around the forecourt and the ministerial entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keenan: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've taken all necessary measures to make sure this building is secure. People coming to work here, or coming to visit here, should feel very confident about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Have there been any recent threats to parliament house? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, there's nothing specific that we are aware of that would give us specific cause for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Have any extra precautions been taken this morning? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be an enhanced AFP presence around the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishophas a similar message for the TV networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no specific threat against parliament house here. We have had increased security arrange minutes for some time, but in relation to the incident in Canada, obviously security arrangements there will be increased substantially as a result of this dreadful incident that has occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots more issues to get across, of course. The Politics Live comments threat is open and ready for your input. If you'd prefer to have a conversation elsewhere, I'm  @murpharoo and the man with the camera is  @mpbowers</SPAN></P>

I understand their deaths have caused some anxiety for our own defence members and their families. Please be assured that defence and other Australian security agencies are actively monitoring developments in Canada and more broadly around the world. We continue to assess all available information to determine what action, if any, may be required in Australia. We also continue to work closely with state and federal police to monitor activity at, and in the vicinity of defence locations. This is not the time for alarm but we should not be complacent about our personal safety. As I have said before, think about where you're going, be aware of your surroundings, and exercise commonsense and judgement when considering where and when to wear your uniform in public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the events of today - worth reposting estimates evidence from Monday about the threat level at parliament house. The Ms Millsin this transcript is Carol Mills, head of DPS, and the Mr Skillis a DPS colleague. The folks asking the questions are Labor senators Penny Wongand John Faulkner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Carol Mills at senate estimates in Parliament House, Monday 20th October 2014 Photograph: Mike Bowers/Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: You have just said 'heightened threat level'. Have we actually established what the threat level is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: The heightened national threat level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: Can I confirm that the Parliament House threat level has not changed since 2010? Is that correct? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: That is correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: So there has been no heightened threat assessment for Parliament House? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: And what is that threat level, please-or however we describe it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: Senator, I do not think we should-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It was asked previously by the President when he was a senator and answered. You might want to reconsider your position on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: We will check that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: If that is the case, we certainly will answer it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: As the President would know, I do not ask questions that go to impinge on security matters in the sense of in any way having a negative impact on the safety and security of people who work in this building-or anywhere else, for that matter. But this has been answered before. We have a situation more broadly in the community, as you know, where the threat level has been raised. But, if it is an issue now, someone might care to explain why-which is fair enough, but please explain it, because it is something that has been in the public arena previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: As I said, if I can confirm that I will certainly answer it, but I guess our general approach to security matters relating to the building is not, in a public forum, to speak about the detail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator WONG: It is. There is a DPS circular that I have in front of me resulting from Mr President, before he was Mr President, in the 2009-10 additional estimates asking a question about threat level. A circular was issued by DPS-I am afraid I only have the first page-and it has at paragraph 2 under 'Background': 'Parliament House has been assessed by the National Threat Assessment Centre within ASIO as being at medium threat level.' It was a public document. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mills: I can confirm that we continue to receive advice from ASIO and that at this point in time the threat level has not changed from that advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator FAULKNER: Take my question in relation to the threat level on notice, if you would not mind, and I will totally accept, Mr President, if there is a security implication of actually using the nomenclature, then best explain that to the committee. I am sure all committee members would accept it. Why is it though-this is something I do not understand-that the national threat level has been increased from medium to high in recent times-I think we are all aware of that-and there has been no change to the threat level at Parliament House?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Skill: That would be a question for ASIO, I would suggest. We do not have the information available to us that the intelligence agencies do have upon which they base their assessments. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are constantly reviewing the security of this and other public buildings. We are constantly reviewing the security of our military bases and our military personnel.

The particular account this morning alleges a push by Morrisonto take control of the government's response to the ebola outbreak. Morrisonsays the claims are untrue. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former press gallery colleague Ben Packham has just shared a link on Twitter to the Post Courier in Papua New Guinea noting that MPs &quot;stood in silence for one-minute in respect for a great Australian leader and prime minister Gough Whitlam who granted PNG independence in 1975.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are in Gough country, I enjoyed a column this morning in The Australian from former journalist and political staffer Nikki Savva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone who encountered him has favourite anecdotes. There is another from that day at old Parliament House. Afterwards in Kings Hall, I asked Gough if I could have my photo taken with him. Of course. Media had been full of allegations of sexual harassment against a NSW Liberal minister, which I assumed prompted Gough to ask if he could put his arm around my shoulder. There was I thinking how endearingly old-fashioned, gentlemanly, he was to seek my permission. Yes, I said. Then just as photographer Mike Bowers was about to click, Gough whispered, sotto voce: &quot;Hold on a moment while I adjust my left testicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should be clearer with the attribution on the Morrisonfracas. The news report I referenced yesterday on Politics Live was from Phil Cooreyof The Australian Financial Review. The story that has prompted the various responses this morning is from the ABC's Andrew Greene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration minister Scott Morrison is pushing for his Operation Sovereign Borders team to take control of Australia's ebola response with new powers to force visitors from West Africa to be isolated in quarantine. The ABC can reveal the ambitious plan as the nation's state and federal chief medical officers meet today to discuss the response to the deadly virus. Mr Morrison let his colleagues know he believed he and his department could take on a larger role in responding to the ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 8.31am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Folks in the building tell me the police have made a call to the office of the House Speaker, Bronwyn Bishop. I'll make a call when time permits to see what, if anything, is being said about that. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretty odd old place right now, the national security committee of Cabinet. Odd when the defence minister doesn't attend meetings when the government is in the process of settling legal authority for a special forces deployment in Iraq - and explains his absence with an overly frank reflection that his presence wouldn't add much. Refreshing, I find Johnstonquite refreshing with his regular truth bombs actually - but.. odd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Daniel Hurst writes this morning that Australia's defence minister, David Johnston, did not attend cabinet's national security committee (NSC) on Wednesday because he &quot;wasn't going to add too much&quot; to the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnston, whose position as defence minister is often said to be under threat, instead continued with a scheduled appearance before a Senate estimates hearing. By contrast, the defence force chief, Mark Binskin, and the secretary of the defence department, Dennis Richardson, delayed their attendance at the Senate hearing so they could participate in NSC deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 8.19am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to addressing questions about the Ottawa shooting this morning, the foreign minister was asked about a story we referenced briefly yesterday on Politics Live - colleagues have been a bit surly about what's being characterised as a power grab by the immigration minister Scott Morrison- surly enough to leak to journalists. The word is Morrisonwants to grab quarantine powers for his border security empire. It's pretty clear that the agriculture minister Barnaby Joycewould like Captain Cronulla to stick to asylum boats. The fight is playing out around the policy responses to the ebola outbreak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishopwas asked about the scrap, and played a very dead bat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've had a number of discussions in our National Security Committee about Australia's response to the ebola outbreak in West Africa. We have been discussing this on a regular basis for some time. We are still in negotiations with other countries about how Australian health workers could be evacuated or treated should they be working in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're providing funding to the United Nations, to front line services , in fact the United Nations has praised Australia's quick and immediate response to provide funding. So there's a very detailed process that we're going through across government and we'll continue to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morrisonhimself is on the radio now. He suggests colleagues bitching about him is a media beat up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are hyperventilating a bit about this issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary officials gave evidence before a senate estimates hearing earlier this week that the threat level at parliament house had not been adjusted since 2010, despite the very obvious deployment in recent weeks of heavily armed federal police around the forecourt and the ministerial entrance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European commission, has rejected out of hand any attempt by David Cameron to &quot;destroy&quot; the fundamental rules of the EU on free movement of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an echo of the remarks by the outgoing president Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, who warned that the prime minister is making a &quot;historic mistake&quot; on the EU, Juncker said on Wednesday that he would not compromise in an &quot;irresponsible way&quot; on rights that date back to foundation of the EEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention by Juncker, at the European parliament in Strasbourg, as MEPs approved the appointment of his new commission team, came as a new poll showed growing support among UK voters for continuing membership of the EU.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ipsos Mori poll, commissioned by the pro-EU Business for New Europe group, found that 56% of voters would support UK membership while 36% would vote to leave if a referendum were held now. The poll shows support for the EU has risen since the issue returned to centre stage with the rise of Ukip after the PM suggested in the summer of 2012 that he would support a referendum on EU membership. In November 2012, five months after Cameron floated the idea of a referendum and two months before he formally committed himself to one, Ipsos Mori found 48% of voters would like to leave the EU while 44% would support membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest poll is a mixed blessing for pro-Europeans. It shows that 43% of voters either broadly support Britain's EU membership terms (29%) or support the idea of the UK joining with other member states for closer integration (14%). But the poll also found that 51% of voters want Britain to be a member of an economic community with no political links (34%) or would like to leave the EU altogether (17%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juncker said he would like to help secure a &quot;fair deal&quot; with Cameron if he were to put a package of reforms to EU leaders after a general election win. But the incoming commission president brushed aside recent suggestions from government sources that restrictions should be imposed on migrants from current EU states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference at the European parliament, Juncker said: &quot;As far as the freedom of movement is concerned... I do think this is a basic principle of the EU since the very beginning and I am not prepared to change this because if we are destroying the freedom of movement other freedoms will fall in a later cause. So I am not ready to compromise in an irresponsible way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Juncker said that any EU leader was free to table proposals to the European Council - the body that comprises the leaders of the 28 EU member states. He added: &quot;We want a fair deal with Britain and it has to be seen how far reaching the compromises can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not in a situation to tell you exactly what the British government will propose and so I am not in a position to tell you what the European commission will deliver as an answer to a British request. But this is not as dramatic a question as it seems. Believe me, it is not as dramatic as it seems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron is expecting to face questions about his reform plans on the margins on an EU summit in Brussels today and on Friday which will formally discuss climate change, economic growth, the Ebola crisis and Ukraine. Herman Van Rompuy, the outgoing European Council president, has said that he would like EU leaders to agree to cut the EU's carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron is planning to shame fellow EU leaders over their dinner on Thursday night into stepping up their response to the Ebola crisis by ensuring that the combined contribution of all 28 EU member states amounts to (EURO)1bn and that 2,000 workers are sent to west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has contributed &pound;125m ((EURO)156m) to its former colony Sierra Leone. The prime minister will say that Britain is contributing (EURO)40m ahead of the EU's largest economy, Germany, four times more than France and 50 times more than Spain, which &quot;with the cases they have had in Madrid have got a real experience of the challenges presented by Ebola&quot;. The total amount pledged by EU states so far amounts to (EURO)750m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alisdair McIntosh, director of Business for New Europe, said of the new poll: &quot;Many of the public recognise the important economic benefits of staying within the EU. Politicians are mistaken if they think people just want to hear ever-louder Eurosceptic rhetoric, especially at a time of economic and political uncertainty. This only increases cynicism about the major political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Politicians need to lead from the front, not shout from the back. They need to set the agenda, and reflect the importance of EU membership to business and the economy. The way to promote prosperity in Britain is to secure realistic reforms of the EU. The government should fight for the reforms that matter most - those that will create growth and jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the deadly Ebola virus continues to ravage the country, two sisterly charitable organizations, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. have dedicated a 96 bedroom Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) constructed at the Unity Conference Center, in Virginia, outside Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation during the dedicatory ceremony yesterday, T. Nelson Williams said further that during this Ebola crisis, the growing demand for more space to accommodate Ebola patients inspired members of their Alpha organizations to launch Phase IV by constructing a 96 bed Ebola Treatment Unit with the help of local and international partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that the two sisterly charitable organizations earlier made several SOS calls to International Organizations based in the United States requesting medical supplies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for distribution to medical facilities in Ebola affected areas in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Williams said this effort is a reality with the support of local and international partners who have made it possible for the completion of the 96 bedroom ETU based on a result of the request made by medical facilities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a 40-foot container with assorted medical supplies, valued at US$600,000 is expected to arrive in Monrovia early November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must continue to fight this war against Ebola until Liberia is declared Ebola free! Until then, we remain steadfast in our efforts to restore our country to normality, the charity organization,&quot; Alphas president noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization also appreciated three Alpha doctors in the fight against the Ebola virus and they included Dr. Lawoubah Gbozee and Keith Gray from JFK Medical Center and Dr. Ayun Cassell, from the JFK Ebola Treatment Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf described members of the Alpha Kappa Sorority, Inc. and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. as patriotic achievers. President Sirleaf made the disclosure on Wednesday, October 22, when both organizations turned over a 96 bed Ebola Treatment Center to the Government of Liberia. The Treatment Center is located in Virginia, Montserrado County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are patriotic achievers, because they saw the need for their country. They first trained people as it relates to having knowledge on Ebola prevention, engaged in other activities and now an Ebola Treatment Center being turned over&quot;, President Sirleaf described ated. The President used the occasion to pay homage to the many doctors, nurses and health workers who have continued to be on the front line in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf who is a member of the organization noted that she visited four hospitals and 17 clinics in Lofa and noticed the health care workers were at work despite many challenges facing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking was Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai who acknowledged the donors of the project said &quot;Something good is coming out of Liberia despite this unfortunate situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President Pro-tempore of the Liberian Senate, Gbehzohngar Findley, is urging national governments in the three regional States ravaged by the Ebola outbreak to forge a united strategy to fight the Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his regular press briefing yesterday, Pro-temp Findley said the borders of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are the epicenters of the disease therefore governments in those countries must act in unison if the disease is to be curtailed from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted that the disease cannot be eradicated according to health experts but believes that it can be contained and its transmission can be put to a halt. The Grand Bassa County Senator said Ebola must be stabilized if Liberia is to regain its economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Findley said this can be a success if the international partners act appropriately and help countries face with this epidemic by providing every needed health materials, financial support and logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, as Grand Bassa County lawmaker, Pro-temp Findley said his embark on an Ebola competition involving several communities across the county by targeting chiefs and traditional leaders with a cash reward of LD 15, 000 against any report on no new cases of the virus within 42 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the objective of the competition is to ensure that residents take preventive initiatives into their own hands thereby stopping the spread of the virus in the various communities adding, &quot;We will and must fight to win this battle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments, Senator Findley has frowned on members of the House of Representatives bent on spreading falsehood in the media about how endorsement of resolutions are made by both the Liberian Senate and the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the remarks while responding to questions as to how the communication from the House of Representatives attached the word'recommendation' while the concurrence from the Liberian Senate had 'endorsed.' Pro-temp Findley said the National Legislature's works are done by consensus and at the end the final agreement is what is sent to the Executive for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Findley said it is impossible to say that the Liberian Senate and the House of Representatives will be thinking on the same line that is why the Liberian Constitution states that one drafts the resolution and the other concurs and if there is a disagreement, the document is sent to a joint committee to trash out the matter so that that document sails smoothly to the Executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He condemned those in the habit of saying things that will bring the Pro-temp's office into disrepute noting that the Liberian Senate is an independent body while the House of Representatives acts as another body citing Article 29 of the Liberian Constitution that states how Legislative powers can be combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-temp Findley vowed to communicate his dislike in the attitude of his colleagues to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alex Tyler and reminded that body that the best way to express dislike is to continuously communicate with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further condemned members of the county caucus who are using their legislative oversights to serve as bosses for the county leadership. Senator Findley said the Development Superintendent of Grand Bassa County has been very responsible all his three years of service in that County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Grand Bassa County lawmaker told his colleagues that as lawmakers, they may have oversight or play supervisory roles but those in the county seat are the ones steering the affairs of the county and must be given the chance to operate in that capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serum, a vaccine made from the blood of recovered Ebola patients could be available within weeks in Liberia, one of the countries' worst hit by the virus, says the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Geneva, Dr. Marie Paule Kieny, said work was also advancing quickly to get drugs and a vaccine ready for January 2015.The Ebola outbreak has already killed more people and most of the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the BBC, Dr. Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director General for Health System and innovation said, &quot;There are partnerships which are starting to be put in place to have capacity in the three countries to safely extract plasma and make preparation that can be used for the treatment of infective patients.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The partnership which is moving fast will be in Liberia where we hope that in the coming weeks there will be facilities set up to collect the blood, treat the blood and be able to process it for use,&quot; Dr. Keiny said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is still unclear how much will become available and whether it could meet demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Serum vaccine is believed that if a person has successfully fought off the infection, it means their body has learned how to combat the virus and they will have antibodies in their blood that can attack Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors can then take a sample of their blood and turn it into serum by removing the red blood cells but keeping the important antibodies which can be used to treat other patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccines will be tested first to see if they are safe for humans, and if they can protect people from the Ebola virus.Once these questions have been answered, the WHO hopes to extend the trials to a much wider group of people and start giving it to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These trials will all start in the coming two weeks and continue for six months to a year but to have initial results about safety and immunogenicity to have a choice of a dose level by the end of this year in December,&quot; WHO expert assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kieny said there were a number of drugs being tested and developed in different countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a partnership between Oxford University and the Wellcome Trust is now visiting sites in the three affected African countries to identify which treatment centers would be adequate and willing to start testing drugs soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the WHO's emergency committee is holding talks to discuss the Ebola epidemic. The meeting in Geneva will examine screening measures at borders and consider whether stricter travel regulations should be put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest news said new US rules requiring air passengers from the three West African countries worst hit by Ebola to travel via one of five airports are coming into effect and travellers from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea must now arrive at O'Hare in Chicago, JFK, Newark, Washington's Dulles or Atlanta, where they will undergo enhanced screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers from these countries will have their temperatures checked as part of screening programs, despite experts warning such moves are unlikely to have an impact. The new security measures come as public concern grows in the US, where three people have been infected and one person has died from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still on the Ebola issue, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma at the head of a 14-member delegation is expected to arrive in Liberia today for a one-day official visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit of the African Union Chairperson to Liberia is part of her tour of the three countries worst affected by the Ebola Virus Disease. The Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission of Africa (ECA) Dr. Carlos Lopes is accompanying her on a visit that will take the delegation to Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Foreign Ministry release, the AU Chairperson will meet with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and other senior officials of Government at the Foreign Ministry to be followed by a Press Stake- Out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AU Chairperson will also meet with UNMIL Chief Karin Landgren, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General on Ebola, Mr. Anthony Branbury and members of the National Ebola Task Force, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release said the visit by Dr. Zuma is to show solidarity and support for the efforts of the Government and People of Liberia in trying to contain the Ebola pandemic and to discuss the African Union's comprehensive efforts, currently ongoing, to combat the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Union has already deployed a 36-member team of medical personnel to assist with the fight against Ebola under the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak Operations in West Africa (ASEOWA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AU Chairperson will use her visit to assess the operations of the team and determine the possibility of scaling up the AU presence in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

The two leaders, Joseph Tamba, president and secretary general, George Williams were dismissed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare several months ago in the wake of strike action by health workers over better salaries and incentives. The two people have been accused of inciting workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the strike action which paralyzed health activities nationwide, the Liberian Senate, unsurprisingly, in keeping with its &quot;Oversight Responsibility', intervened to find an amicable solution to the crisis. At the end of the Senate's intervention, it was reported that the dismissed health workers leaders be reinstated. Whether this was a commitment made by the Minister, Dr. Walter Gwenigale, or not, it is widely believed that the Senate's intervention would see the two officials back to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, since then, the Ministry has not reinstated the two workers, until recently when the issues resurfaced when health workers, especially those associated with the fight against Ebola staged a &quot;go-slow' action in demand of better salaries and incentives. During the recent go-slow action, it was said that one of the demands of the health workers was the reinstatement of their two dismissed leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Minister who appeared on October 13 at the regular Ebola Press Conference at the Ministry of Information, maintained that if anyone is on strike because of the two dismissed health workers, leaders to be reinstated, might as well stay at home, as these dismissed leaders would NEVER be reinstated. In his words he unflinchingly said, &quot;Those dismissed health workers' leadership will never be reinstated. They will not come back to work thus if anyone is striking to have them reinstated, the striking health workers must just stay home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stance of the Minister has now caused a bad blood between him and the Liberian Senate, causing that body to cite him recently. During the hearing, Dr. Gwenigale reiterated his stance that those dismissed workers would not be reinstated, describing them as being very dangerous.He said he has acted and his boss (The President) has endorsed his action. However, some of the Senators saw his stance as an act of arrogance. The Minister was again scheduled to reappear before that body yesterday, but cited health reasons for his inability to face that august body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the hearing has now been rescheduled for next Tuesday at which time Minister Gwenigale is instructed to appear along with a health certificate from a recognized healthcare worker. At yesterday's plenary session, Senators had diverse views upon receiving of the Health Minister's letter requesting rescheduling of reappearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Mabutu Nyenpan proffered a motion that the body allows the Minister to appear next Tuesday to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for accusing that august body of inciting health workers to protest even though Minister Gwenigale had earlier told the Senate Committee on Health that the request of reinstating the dismissed health workers was dangerous to the health sector and had served as an incitement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other senators like Joseph Nagbe, Sumo Kupee and Geraldine Doe Sheriff made several amendments to modify or squash the motion among which was that Minister Gwenigale be left alone because to reschedule his appearance will be like a waste of time for that body since in his communication he said clearly that &quot;After my appearance before the Senate last Thursday, my blood pressure went up and is still up with mild headache. Appearing before you again tomorrow will further increase my pressure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senators said to continue to request the appearance of the Health Minister is a fruitless effort because his blood pressure will always be high but Bomi County Junior Senator, Sando Johnson argued that their argument will serve as a deterrent for the Health Minister to disrespect that body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this matter is pending before the Senate, I wish to join the public discussion on the matter. Initially, when the Minister used the word &quot;NEVER,&quot; I said it was too strong especially in the conflict situation, where negotiations are possible. In that article, entitled: &quot;I thought &quot;NEVER&quot; Belongs To God,' in which I pleaded with the Minister to see reasons based on the plethora of appeals for those dismissed leaders to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, since the Minister is still maintaining his stance against these dismissed leaders, as the Chief Administrator of the Ministry, something that is in his purview, especially so when the Minister said that his boss has endorsed his action, I rest my case on that aspect of the case.Howbeit, let me thank the Liberian Senate and other lawmakers for their interest in the matter. But fort some of us to insist that the dismissed workers be reinstated, would send a bad signal to the issue of the 'Separation of Powers,' and more importantly, by doing so, would be a bad precedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, I share the concern for them to go back to work, but since the man responsible is maintaining his stance, and more so that his action has been approved by his boss, let sleeping dog lie. As for the contempt hanging over him, I believe that it is not on the issue of urging him to reinstate the dismissed workers; perhaps, it's on different matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding, all is not lost. There is still remedy at law. If the dismissed leaders feel that the Minister or Ministry's action was illegal or unlawful, then, they have to proceed to the proper judicial forum. Since I am not their lawyer, it is not my duty to advise which one of the judicial forums is appropriate for this. If they are civil servants, there is a judicial forum, whether it is quasi or not; if they are above such status, there is still a forum for redress, which must be pursued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we have repeatedly said that this is a country of laws and not men, therefore, we must make use of the appropriate legal avenues. Laws are made, too, to protect us and also to ensure that people get justice, whenever they observe injustice. This is why the Constitution says that all of us are 'equal before the law.&quot; And so if anyone feels hurt or unjustly treated, the best option to look to is the judicial forum. Even during this state of emergency, there is still room for redress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should not be misconstrued as suggesting that the Ministry is right or wrong, but still insist on resorting to the proper forum.This is why this kind of forum is usually referred to as the &quot;last resort,&quot; meaning that if all other avenues fail, the judicial forum is the best alternative. Since the Minister is unwavering about not reinstating these two workers, the best way out is the judicial forum. I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American radio is a culture shock. It's been 15 years since I last listened to it day by day. I would need the pen of Jonathan Swift to do it justice now. On ordinary AM stations politicians urge the impeachment of President Obama for violating the constitution, so angry they barely articulate their reasons. Some make it sound as if he has invented Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola leads every news bulletin. Talk show hosts demand all flights from Africa be blocked. Government spokesmen offering reminders of the low risk to the general public, the safety precautions already in place, the single death in the USA so far, are roundly mocked. Fear is the ultimate satisfaction. Not on the commercials, of course. Here is a world where dreams, whether of a new bed or an insurance policy, come true. But only in America. The rest of the world, with the exception of Africa of Ebola infamy, does not seem to exist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I got back from Atlanta, New York and western Massachusetts I turned on the radio the minute I was through the door. Oh no! Brookfield, the fictional home of generations of imagined Archers, may be up for sale. David and Ruth Archer are thinking of selling, moving, farming in the north east. Good grief, don't they know about the weather there? Calm down, Gillian. This is probably the early stages of the customary Christmas plot rocker. Remember Brian's romance with Siobhan? Adam's civil wedding to Ian? They were both snaps in the annual Archers cracker. Hang on, though. What's really happening after that Lower Loxley Hall scandal, the two night stand of Elizabeth and Roy? Is that the gunpowder trail set to explode on Christmas Eve?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough speculation. Back to radio reality. Ah yes, here's Jarvis Cocker on Radio 4 on Mondays with Wireless Nights. This week he pretended to go to the moon. He said he'd always wanted to ever since he was 5 and saw the first man step out onto the lunar surface. So here he was, inside an aural collage created by him (and clever producer Laurence Grissell) where people spoke of floating in space, or being cut off by the tide, or being on life support in hospital and Jarvis perkily interrogated himself (&quot;All right, clever clogs&quot;) and the similarities of their states. Outer space, inner space, the &quot;fathomless impossibility&quot; of space flight. &quot;Oof,&quot; said Jarvis, sounding just like John Shuttleworth, his imaginary fellow Sheffield native, &quot;we've landed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Radio 3's In Tune last Friday joined the current national rush to explore Germany. Live at the British Museum Sean Rafferty guided a packed audience, a brilliant viol consort, two young tenors and their gifted accompanist, through a part of German history omitted from the astonishingly good daily Radio 4 series, Germany: Memories of a Nation. (You've got it. The music. Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Strauss and, stretching the boundary to Austria, Mozart.) On the stage with Rafferty was British Museum Director Neil MacGregor, presenter of the radio programmes, even livelier in Friday's ad-libs, funny, perceptive, generous. It was a very good show, on stage and on air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The premise of MacGregor's Radio 4 series is to make us look at the world from a different angle, to understand history through familiar things, cars to coins. Monday's episode was about Gutenberg, the invention of printing, why it happened where it did, how the printed book heralded a social revolution. Yesterday's was about Durer but each one (and you can hear them all via the BBC iPlayer for a whole year) breaks boundaries of preconception. Friends telephone to urge me to mention the one about sausages, the one about the flag, but it's hard to choose. Every one so far has been a joy. It is wonderful to step into a world where great scholars welcome you to new comprehension of history, geography and the transcendent power of art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The illusion is that this is personal. MacGregor and his expert guests seem to talk just to me. That's the magic of sound. I went to MacGregor's lecture to the Friends of the British Museum back in May when the forthcoming series and exhibition were first mentioned. Not an empty seat, not a single cough. At the September press launch of the series I heard a journalist wonder why it hadn't been done for TV? Cost is the easy answer. A good reason, however, for Germany: Memories of a Nation being only on BBC radio is that sound can make us concentrate more than we do for TV, reach out to ideas, embrace them. Thank heavens (and producer Paul Kobrak) it still does.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD NEWS</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is well prepared for an Ebola outbreak but the best way to ensure the threat to the UK does not escalate is to fight the disease in west Africa, Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies told MPs on the Commons health select committee that airport screening had been introduced mainly to alert people coming from Ebola-affected countries as to what to do should they develop symptoms. She conceded that the screening was not mandatory and said that one person so far had refused to comply with a request to have their temperature taken and answer a questionnaire covering any contact they had had with sick people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Public Health England followed [him]up. I believe he is well,&quot; she said. She did not know who the traveller was because of data protection rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies said her message to the international community was: &quot;We need to act now because if we leave it longer there will not only be more deaths and heartache, [and] it will cost vastly more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the British public, she wanted to say: &quot;The risks are very low, the planning is very good and we should see very few cases - and it is not airborne.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies was speaking as more details emerged about plans to bring experimental vaccines and treatments to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The World Health Organisation revealed that some patients could soon be given blood from survivors who have developed antibodies against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaccines were likely to be tried for health workers and burial teams in the new year, although only in the context of large-scale clinical trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general at the WHO, said: &quot;I'm not saying there will be mass population immunisation starting in January 2015. This is not the case. We're talking about tens of thousands of doses, not millions, in January.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the vaccines were given to people on the &quot;frontline&quot;, scientists could not say whether they would protect against the virus, however an unprecedented manufacturing effort had begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GlaxoSmithKline was reported to be producing 10,000 doses of its vaccine, while 800 vials of a Canadian vaccine had arrived in Geneva, ready for the treatment's first trials in humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company Johnson and Johnson said it would manufacture more than a million doses of its own treatment, 250,000 of which would be available for trials before May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO has released new figures showing that there have been 9,936 cases and 4,877 deaths from Ebola so far in the current outbreak. The numbers are doubling every three or four weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, MPs expressed concerns about how prepared GP practices in the UK might be for dealing safely with anyone walking into a waiting room with symptoms of Ebola. A&amp;E hospital staff had told committee members that they did not know where their storage areas were for personal protective equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies said: &quot;I think they should know where it is, how to put it on, and, more importantly, how to take it off - and have agreed about who will be the first to do it.&quot; Information and training was available to NHS staff; she hoped they would recognise it was in their interests to be ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk assessment modelling suggested there would be only a handful of cases in the UK at worst before Christmas, she said, so the threat to the UK was low, but that could change depending on how the epidemic developed in west Africa. &quot;We may have to revise it up, which would be sad, or down, which is more likely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said his staff, who were doing the entry screening, had legal powers to act if someone was ill. &quot;If somebody is unwell at a port of entry there are very clear powers where we can provide for somebody to be taken to an appropriate place of isolation and assessment,&quot; he said. But the traveller would have to be obviously sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies said that in the event of someone arriving from west Africa with a fever and entering a district general hospital or GP practice, the reaction might be &quot;say hello, [say] here's a glass of water and I'm shutting the door and will call the experts to work out what to do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;If you do think it is Ebola the ambulance service will be asked to move them to another place where they have more expertise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Free, she said, was the specialist centre but there were also beds in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield. More needed to be done, however, to ensure NHS staff knew what to do in the unlikely event of a case, said Davies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we are where we need to be, but the risk is low at the moment,&quot; she warned. &quot;This isn't infection control as they are used to it, where they need to protect the patient; this is more like pilots who, if they make a mistake, go down with the aircraft.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced it will monitor for 21 days anyone entering the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, west African nations that have been hard-hid by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning Monday, travellers from those nations will be expected to check in with health officials daily, and provide updates on their temperatures and any possible Ebola symptoms. The move was announced Wednesday, a day after the Obama administration announced new restrictions on travellers from the same three countries, routing them through the US airports with Ebola-screening procedures in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the American cameraman who contracted Ebola while covering the outbreak in Liberia as an NBC freelancer has been cleared of the virus and is due to leave the specialist unit in Omaha where he was nursed to health.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashoka Mukpo, 33, has been receiving treatment at a biocontainment unit at Nebraska medical centre in Omaha since arriving in the US on 6 October. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that Mukpo's blood test was negative, meaning the virus is no longer in his bloodstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recovering from Ebola is a truly humbling feeling,&quot; Mukpo said in a statement. &quot;Too many are not as fortunate and lucky as I've been. I'm very happy to be alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukpo is one of eight Ebola patients who have been treated in the US. He said on Twitter that he does not know how he contracted the virus, but he does not regret covering the outbreak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I don't regret going to Liberia to cover the crisis. That country was a second home to me and I had to help raise the alarm,&quot; he said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukpo is the second Ebola patient to walk out of the Nebraska hospital virus-free. Dr Rick Sacra, a family physician from Massachusetts who contracted the virus while caring for patients in Liberia, was released from the unit on 25 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our staff was confident it would be able to successfully care for another patient,&quot; Dr Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit, said in a statement. &quot;We've learned firsthand that caring for a patient with the Ebola virus presents challenges you don't face in the regular hospital environment. But our years of training on protocol in the unit and gaining familiarity with all the personal protective equipment was certainly an advantage for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukpo received a blood transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly, who also donated his blood to Sacra. Survivor's blood contains antibodies that are thought to help Ebola patients' immune systems fight the disease. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Dallas nurse who contracted the virus while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, America's Ebola patient zero, has been upgraded from &quot;fair&quot; to &quot;good&quot;, the hospital said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nina Pham's condition had dropped upon her arrival at the National Institutes for Health (NIH) specialist facility in Bethesda, Maryland, last week. Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at the time that the disease is fatiguing and Pham's journey from Texas to Maryland has exhausted her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second nurse, Amber Vinson, is being treated at a similar facility at Emory University hospital in Atlanta. On Twitter, Mukpo wished the nurses well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are only four biocontainment units in the US. They include Nebraska medical center in Omaha; the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland; Emory University hospital in Atlanta; and St Patrick hospital in Missoula, Montana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital statement said Mukpo would speak to reporters after his release. On Twitter, he said he would be happy to talk to the media, but only after he sees his family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more upbeat mood seen this week among investors continued, with European stock markets finishing the day in positive territory. Some reasonable US numbers from the likes of Yahoo and Boeing, plus weak US inflation figures which could convince the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer, combined to lift traders's spirits. But it was not all optimistic, with talk of a number of European lenders set to fail the forthcoming EU bank stress tests. Meanwhile the ECB seemed to be playing down talk it would buy corporate bonds as part of its attempts to boost the struggling eurozone economy. Wall Street moved higher by the time Europe's traders went home but then started to slip back. The final scores in Europe showed:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Angela Monaghan was listening to the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority's appearance earlier before the Treasury Select Committee hearing and writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey said that contrary to reports from the EBA that the vote was unanimous, he was against the proposals. Confirming his vote publicly for the first time, he told the committee:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't agree with the opinion. I did not vote for the opinion. [The idea that the vote was unanimous] was incorrectly transmitted by the EBA. I was made aware because our press office was contacted [by the media] to say that they had received communication from the EBA that it was a unanimous vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now this was obviously a problem because as you can imagine, it would be unlikely we would vote for that. So I spoke to the EBA and said frankly I am very surprised that you have informed journalists of the vote because I thought the rules of engagement were that we didn't do that, and moreover you appear to have informed them incorrectly. I've been in touch with [the EBA chairman] Andrea Enria. To be fair to him he said yes, that is a mistake. He told me he would correct it. We will have an EBA meeting shortly and it will be a subject for the meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juncker and his 28-strong team take office on 1 November. This morning he outlined his priorities to MEPs, promising a (EURO)300bn plan to boost jobs and growth, although much of this is to come from private investors, not governments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote is now largely a formality and the Parliament is expected to back Juncker's team with a big majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, we are getting some reports from Twitter that the ECR group, which includes the UK's Conservatives, plans to abstain from the vote. This would mean Tory MEPs failing to back the UK's choice for European commissioner, Lord Hill, the former lobbyist handpicked by David Cameron for the job.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank of England minutes: what the economists say  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this morning's BoE minutes showed a majority of MPC members are in favour of keeping rates on hold, analysts are not expecting change any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market watchers think rates could be stuck at their current historic low of 0.5% well into 2015, or even into 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alex Edwards at UK Forex thinks if the economy continues down its current path, the first rate hike may not happen until early 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of England monetary policy meeting minutes painted a fairly bleak picture this morning, suggesting that weaker growth and low in inflation in the eurozone has increased risks to the UK. Also, with average earnings still struggle to keep pace with the low level of inflation a rate hike wasn't justified. Although two members did vote for a rate hike, the bank is a lot more dovish now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeremy Cook at World First foreign exchange company, agrees that slowing momentum in the international and global economy means low rates will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressures on the UK economy from the Eurozone and China were the main concerns of the Bank of England, but alongside recent falls in inflation and wage growth, the market seems justified in shifting its expectations of when the Bank of England will look to start normalising monetary policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Momentum within and without the UK economy has slowed; we have seen slowing growth in China, the US, the Eurozone and likely the UK this Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, is forecasting a rate rise in mid 2015, after the general election. He suggests that some of the recent pessimism may be overdone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We expect only a mild UK slowdown, although a little sharper than the BoE is banking on. Manufacturing is suffering from stalled Eurozone growth, but there are no signs of the wider contagion to the UK that came in 2011/12. Moreover, the disastrous August German data were exaggerated by holiday timing. If the downside risks do not materialise and Eurozone growth resumes early next year, which is our base case, then the gloom now will give way to a rosier growth outlook next year. Indeed, that outlook would then be boosted by cheaper food and energy prices. We look for the BoE to begin hiking in June next year, after the uncertainty around the general election has passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, has downgraded his forecasts. He and his team expect rates to rise to 1% by late 2015 and to 2% by the end of 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have recently put back our expectation of the first interest rate hike from February to mid-2015. We suspect that the majority of MPC members will prefer to err on the side of caution in raising interest rates - given increased global growth concerns (particularly the weakness in the Eurozone) posing an increased downside risk to the UK growth outlook, earnings growth still weak and consumer price inflation down to 1.2% in September and likely to go lower still in the near term given the weakness of oil prices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How the Bank voted on interest rates  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of England minutes refer to the last MPC meeting held on 7 &amp; 8 October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority view </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most members of the rate-setting committee said there was not enough evidence of inflationary pressure to justify raising interest rates. They highlighted falling labour costs, weak pay growth and signs that economic growth is beginning to slow down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For these members, there remained few signs of inflationary pressure in the UK economy, even after looking through the effects of a stronger sterling exchange rate. In particular, unit labour costs had fallen over the past year. Pay growth, which was likely to remain subdued in the public sector, was lower than was consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Household inflation expectations had fallen a little, although they continued to be well anchored to the inflation target. While the economy had been growing sufficiently quickly to absorb some of the slack in the economy, there were some signs that the pace of growth was beginning to ease. The housing market appeared to be cooling with house price growth slowing to a more sustainable pace. Further downside news in the euro area had increased the risks to the durability of the UK expansion in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minority view </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two of the bank's external members wanted to raise rates to 0.75%, arguing that keeping rates too low for too long would unbalance the recovery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While growth in the euro-area economy had been disappointing, so far, in contrast to 2011, the United Kingdom had not been affected by damaging financial contagion. The continued fall in the unemployment rate was consistent with the rapid absorption of slack and, even if the rate at which unemployment was falling were to ease markedly, it would nonetheless reach its estimated medium-term equilibrium level by the middle of 2015. Survey evidence of tightening in the labour market, including from the Bank's Agents, suggested that wage growth might pick up quite sharply as slack was absorbed. Since monetary policy could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them. It was possible that the real rate of interest consistent with stable inflation over the medium term was now rising. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On today's agenda  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Interest rates will not rise before the election'. This has been the consensus among economists for several weeks, even before the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane said that he felt gloomier about the prospects for the UK economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month we found out that two members of the Bank's monetary policy committee voted to raise rates. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, both external members of the committee, called for rates to rise to 0.75% in response to lower unemployment and a tightening labour market, but were outvoted by the seven other members of the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then the prospects of a rate rise ahead of May's general election have diminished even further, as a result of falling inflation, rising oil prices and concern about the stagnant outlook for the eurozone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capital Economics expects a repeat of last month's 7:2 split.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rapid easing of present and pipeline price pressures will surely have convinced the seven members of the MPC who voted to keep rates on hold last month to maintain their votes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the figures were released after its meeting, the MPC would have known that CPI inflation fell to just 1.2% in September - well below its 1.7% forecast in August's Inflation Report. And the sharp fall in oil prices, from &pound;100pb at September's meeting to just $88pb at October's, has left CPI inflation on track to dip below 1% later this year - a rate that would force Mr. Carney to reach for his letter-writing pen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has announced it hopes to begin testing two experimental Ebola vaccines in west Africa by January and may have a blood serum treatment available for use in Liberia within two weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's health agency said it aimed to begin testing the two vaccines in the new year on more than 20,000 frontline health care workers and others in west Africa - a bigger rollout than previously envisioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, a senior Red Cross official said he was confident the epidemic could be contained within four to six months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday that the outbreak could be contained if there was &quot;good isolation, good treatment of the cases which are confirmed, good dignified and safe burials of deceased people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Marie Paule Kieny, an assistant director general at the WHO, said the first tens of thousands of Ebola vaccines could be distributed in the first months of the new year. Kieny acknowledged there were many &quot;ifs&quot; remaining and &quot;still a possibility that it [a vaccine] will fail&quot;. But she sketched out a much broader experiment than was imagined only six months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are quite large trials,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kieny said in remarks reported by the BBC that a serum was also being developed for use in Liberia based on antibodies extracted from the blood of Ebola survivors. &quot;There are partnerships which are starting to be put in place to have capacity in the three countries to safely extract plasma and make preparation that can be used for the treatment of infective patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The partnership which is moving the quickest will be in Liberia where we hope that in the coming weeks there will be facilities set up to collect the blood, treat the blood and be able to process it for use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WHO spokeswoman, Fadela Chaib, said the agency expected 20,000 vaccinations in January and similar numbers in the months afterwards using the trial products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An effective vaccine would still not in itself be enough to stop the outbreak but could protect the medical workers who are central to the effort. More than 200 of them have died of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real-world testing in west Africa will go forward only if the vaccines prove safe and trigger an adequate immune-system response in volunteers during clinical trials that are either under way or planned in Europe, Africa and the US. The preliminary safety data is expected to become available by December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the vaccines that Kieny mentioned, Okairos AG, is being developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline from a modified chimpanzee-cold virus and an Ebola protein. It is being made in Rome, according to GSK, with clinical trials under way in Britain and Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have other vaccine facilities around the world and we are seeing what we can do to ramp up production to commercial scale,&quot; said Mary Anne Rhyne, GSK's US director of external communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second frontrunner, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and known as VSV-EBOV, has been sent to the US Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on healthy volunteers. It would also be tested shortly among volunteers in Switzerland, Germany, Gabon and Kenya, Kieny said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals announced on Tuesday it had begun limited manufacturing of a therapeutic product targeting the Ebola-Guinea virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tekmira said on Tuesday that the new product, part of its TKM-Ebola programme, would be available by early December. But it did not specify how many doses it was making, or whether it was a drug or vaccine. Its TKM-Ebola programme is aimed at developing a treatment to stop the virus replicating in an infected person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Medicines Agency said on Monday it was ready to offer Ebola treatments and vaccines the benefits of &quot;orphan&quot; drug status - including extended market exclusivity - in a bid to encourage their development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orphan drug status is given to compel companies to develop treatments for rare conditions, which they might not otherwise make because of lower profit chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapp Biopharmaceutical - which gave its experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp to US medical workers Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who recovered after contracting Ebola in Liberia, and to at least one Spanish priest, who died - said it had begun manufacturing the drug using conventional methods that would produce greater quantities for more human testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak in west Africa has killed more than 4,500 people, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, since it began 10 months ago. Experts have said the world could see 10,000 new cases a week in two months if authorities did not take stronger steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone said on Tuesday the number of infected people in the country's western region was soaring, with more than 20 deaths a day. The region is on the opposite side of the country from where the first cases emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Tuesday, the WHO's Chaib promised a thorough public audit of the agency's early missteps in responding to the Ebola crisis but said for the moment &quot;our focus is on the response&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report                   </SPAN></P>

Whether or not this stand off can be resolved depends on how pragmatic the Abbott government is prepared to be. I can't really see what's in it for Labor to fold on this issue: this is a mess entirely of the government's making, and folding will give the Greens another stick with which to beat ALP members in contested seats - although, of course, stranger things have happened at sea. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've had a bit of time shifting going on today. Why leave time travel to politicians and Dr Who? I might do a little of it as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, as we've flagged, is red tape reduction day. By way of illustration, government figures today have raised one positive example of sweeping away pointless regulations - removing a requirement that all imported motorbikes be fitted with rear mud guards. This has saved big bucks and made life better, according to the official rationale. With that milestone in mind, let's roll back briefly to Monday, and transport estimates. Labor was having a small poke about the mud guard issue, wanting to know how $14m could be saved by whipping off a small piece of metal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mud guard revolution was clearly news to the committee chairman, Liberal Bill Heffernan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heffernan: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouldn't they have a standard, like you have with brakes? Have you ever ridden behind a motor bike without a rear mud guard? You get sprayed with crap and stones. Why would we agree to remove them? What brain dead person did that?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recommendations of the Liberal-Labor committee are not enough to save this from being a very bad bill that will trample on long-held civil liberties and democratic rights. The committee's recommendations are just tweaking around the edges - they do not fix the substantive problems of this bill. The Australian Greens are particularly concerned about the no-go zones, preventative detention orders and biometric data and we will be moving much more substantive amendments when the bill is debated next week. Trashing legal protections and freedoms will not make Australians safer. The Labor party needs to realise this and stop waving through draconian laws without proper scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More questions on the RET. Journalists at the club want to know whether Macfarlaneis actually serious when he says the starting point for the talks is the real 20% (given Labor has already said no and the renewables industry has said a cut of that magnitude will cripple the sector.) He says he is serious about that being the starting point. The industry minister says the Coalition did not sign up to a 27% RET (which it effectively is now, largely due to a fall in demand for energy) - it signed up to a 20% RET. He's also pressed on why he's keeping the household scheme. Macfarlanesays that's where the government sees the growth. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There haven't been submarines built in South Australia for almost 15 years, so there aren't jobs that are going to disappear as a result of a decision being made to buy a submarine overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, there will be new jobs in South Australia, highly paid jobs, because wherever those submarines are built, one thing is for sure that the highly skilled, highly sophisticated requirements in terms of weapons systems and defence systems and all the electronics that go into it have to be fitted in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those systems, if not all of them, will be sourced from America, and the only place they will be able to be fitted will be in SA - so there will be long-term new highly paid jobs, both in terms of maintenance, about you also in terms of fitout.</SPAN></P>

I'd be more effusive but we need to track back to the industry minister at the National Press Club, because Macfarlaneis outlining the government's standing start position in negotiating with the ALP to try and strike a compromise on the future of the renewable energy target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics Live readers probably know that negotiations are about to begin to try and mop up the mess the Abbott government created for itself when it asked a self-declared climate sceptic to review the RET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlaneis using his NPC outing to announce some of the terms of engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can say, but I have today, along with Greg Hunt, delivered a letter to the opposition outlining the basis to our negotiation which will start at 3.30 this afternoon, and that basis is that we will maintain RET at 20% real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, there will be no change to the household photovoltaic scheme. That is they will be able to continue as they can under the legislation, and that we will exempt from the target all energy intensive trade-exposed industries as currently defined in the act, and that that includes, of course, aluminium, but a number of other industries with I are under pressure and the jobs in those industries are under pressure, from costs overall and so maintaining pressure on those industries by maintaining them in the RET is illogical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will also be asking that as a result of these negotiations that the two-yearly reviews cease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Labor has already agreed to exempt aluminium. But it has been clear over the past few weeks that it will not cop a real 20%.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're always pleased if numbers are lower rather than higher but I live in the real world and I talk to real Australians. Real Australians are concerned that their cost of living is going up, not down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, the real statisticians at the Australian Bureau of Statistics today reported that the consumer price index rose 0.5% in the September quarter, following a rise of 0.5% in the June quarter. The year-on-year figure is 2.3%, down from 3% previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a breakdown from the ABS :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant price rises this quarter were for fruit (+14.7%), new dwelling purchase by owner-occupiers (+1.1%), property rates and charges (+6.3%) and other services in respect of motor vehicles (+5.8%). These rises were partially offset by falls in electricity (-5.1%) and automotive fuel (-2.5%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures price change for consumption goods and services acquired by Australian resident households. The Australian Government repealed carbon pricing with effect from 1 July 2014. It is not possible to quantify the impact of removing the carbon price on the price change measured by the CPI.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have today made a formal request to the prosecutor at the international criminal court in the Hague in the Netherlands asking her to investigate specific individuals and in particular that they might have contravened article 7 of the Rome statute, and committed crimes against humanity, by the way they have treated asylum seekers attempting to come to Australia over a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way the ICC works, I need to name specific individuals and I have named the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and all 19 members of his Cabinet, including the immigration minister, Scott Morrison. In my application to the prosecutor, I have specifically identified offences, crimes against humanity such as the forced relocation of people, obviously to the Republic of Nauru and to Papua New Guinea but also there have been repeated instances of forced relocation of people back to areas from which they claim to be fleeing persecution and in particular Sri Lanka. I've also identified the inhuman conditions within detention centres and other matters that I ask her to look into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the prosecutor does from here remains to be seen. The ball's very much in her court but I hope that she will respond to this request and will promptly investigate these matters and will ultimately make a recommendation that the names be given to the pretrial chamber and that the International Criminal Court commence proceedings against the prime minister and the 19 members of his Cabinet. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUP senator Jacqui Lambiewants to know what percentage of our SAS that we are &quot;risking&quot; in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 9.49am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First recorded incidence of blogue brain for today - a colleague has just very kindly pointed out I've been calling Ray Griggs 'Ray Briggs' for an hour or so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know why really, given I know he's not Briggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case it's corrected now. Apologies. Shocker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 9.44am AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-Admiral Griggs: Iraq will be a long campaign  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroyasks about the very first combat mission over Iraq, where no targets were engaged. Griggssays there is a senior Australian defence person embedded in the chain of command who ensures Australian contributions are in the national interest. It was decided in that particular instance that the risk of collateral damage was too great, and the Australian official invoked a red card. Of 56 missions - three thus far have involved engaging targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does this red card system work? Griggssays it's a process ensuring Australians remain within the rules of engagement and avoid collateral damage. Conroyasks whether Australia's attitude to collateral damage is reflected commonly across the coalition group or whether we have a higher threshold. Griggsdeclines to answer that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroywants particulars on the legal authority. Are we operating on a template legal arrangement or do we have our own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been invited to operate and we have clearance to operate. Broadly, it's the same (as other partners in the coalition).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggsdoes not want to address details. He says the legal authority is a sensitive issue with the Iraqis, so he'd prefer not to comment. He says the ADF is satisfied Australian personnel will have all the necessary immunities and protections before deployment. Conroy asks whether the legal protections will stand in Iraqi law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroythen asks how long this mission is expected to continue. Griggsflicks that to the minister, David Johnston. He says speculation about duration is unhelpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What will be defined as success in degrading and disrupting ISIS? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays this will be a long campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not something that will be quick and decisive. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Senator Stephen Conroy at the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in Parliament House this morning, Wednesday 22nd October 2014. Photograph: Mike Bowers/Guardian Australia   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice Admiral Griggssays broadly, Iraq is currently under the influence of three military organisations. The Peshmerga, the Iraqi security forces, and ISIS - active in the west and north west, through the Euphrates Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is ongoing heavy fighting in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays the air campaign is having a significant effecton how ISIS does its business. He says the air campaign has curtailed the freedom of movement of the militants. They are not making progress. They are now contracting into urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That complicates the targeting of the air campaign. It's a challenge if they contract into urban areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Is Baghdad in danger of falling? Or is that a media beat-up? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think for about five months now people have been saying Baghdad will fall next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's overblown. The disposition around Baghdad is relatively stable and has been for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays militants are in the west but not in the central area of Baghdad. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given we are participating in combat in the Middle East, I reckon it's prudent if I listen-in first today to defence estimates.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uhlmann also asks Shortenabout ebola, and the Abbott government's approach to the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shorten: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What leaves a lot of ordinary Australians scratching their heads is this. The government has been willing to lean forward on international matters on other occasions but it doesn't take a Rhodes scholarship to work out if you don't deal with this deadly disease at the pount of outbreak and if it is allowed to spread we will need more costly solutions down the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Ebola is no challenge for Australia and if it is we just wait until it reaches Papua New Guinea to deal with it, to me, is a very dangerous idea. To me, this is a clear case where you should help do what you can now to avoid it being a much bigger problem down the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: And do you believe that immigration should have a greater hand in the border protection of this? It seems to be a bit of a tussle going on in cabinet over the moment over who has responsibility? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I've read about a split emerging in the government about biosecurity. It seems to me that the insiders would say this was another Scott Morrison land grab at the expense of his colleagues. For me though, the real issue here is biosecurity, which helps protect our agricultural industries, for example, has a scientific role as well as a compliance role. I'm not sure that just moving everything into Customs would help our farming communities be secure from international diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Just for the record, the weekly Essential poll released yesterday afternoon found that 58% of voters believe the government is currently doing enough to help fight ebola. Only 21% think it's not doing enough.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the day still finding its feet, the Labor leader Bill Shorten has called by the ABC studios to reflect on Whitlam. Shorten'shost, Chris Uhlmann, would prefer to hear something more than generalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortenis asked about lessons from the Whitlamperiod. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did his homework. He spent years and years preparing his and Labor's ideas for government. I think that is one of the big lessons. He used his years in opposition. So my challenge, and the lesson for me, from Gough Whitlam the opposition leader, is let us use this time now between now and the next election to have a view of Australia not just at the next election but what sort of country we want to be in 2024.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Do you think that Tony Abbott would disagree with any of those things? Aren't all of those things really motherhood statements? How do you make those real? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well there's about three questions in that. First of all, whether or not Tony Abbott rhetorically agrees or disagrees you have to look at his actions. We are not moving the country forward when we're cutting access to healthcare. We are not moving the country forward when we're making it harder for kids to go to university. We're not moving the country forward when we're turning our back in terms of building modern infrastructure, the NBN, which allows this country to engage more with the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: When will you put meat on the bones of these statements? When will we see the policies that will take you into the next election? </SPAN></P>

The former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlamdied yesterday, at 98.

They seem to be now more than $2bn. The prime minister will make a statement to the House this morning on the enduring desirability of letting businesses develop things without having to deal with pesky governments. After that, eleven bills will be introduced to repeal other bills. Proper debate on this issue will occur next week. Apparently there is to be a spring repeal day, bring Zyrtec and a packed lunch.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The Australian also says the prime minister will delay imposing additional curbs on foreign investment in farmland until after the agreement is signed. Perhaps I'm very thick but I don't quite grasp that last point: free trade deals generally cover exhaustively all elements of foreign investment. I'm not sure how this gets addressed later on. But I'm sure all will be revealed in the fullness of time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I neglected to mention that Labor has said again this afternoon - after the meeting with government ministers - that the &quot;real 20%&quot; is just not a goer when it comes to the RET. Whether or not this stand off can be resolved depends on how pragmatic the Abbott government is prepared to be. I can't really see what's in it for Labor to fold on this issue: this is a mess entirely of the government's making, and folding will give the Greens another stick with which to beat ALP members in contested seats - although, of course, stranger things have happened at sea. </SPAN></P>

They discussed the situation in Iraq, the ebola epidemic and the upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane. The president thanked Australia for its efforts in Iraq and continued commitment to disrupting and degrading ISIL. They agreed that the international community needed to act swiftly to arrest the ebola epidemic and the president thanked the prime minister for Australia's contribution to date. The US and Australia will continue to coordinate closely on both these matters and other national security priorities. The prime minister said he looked forward to welcoming the president to Brisbane in November for the G20.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, as we've flagged, is red tape reduction day. By way of illustration, government figures today have raised one positive example of sweeping away pointless regulations - removing a requirement that all imported motorbikes be fitted with rear mud guards. This has saved big bucks and made life better, according to the official rationale. With that milestone in mind, let's roll back briefly to Monday, and transport estimates. Labor was having a small poke about the mud guard issue, wanting to know how $14m could be saved by whipping off a small piece of metal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mud guard revolution was clearly news to the committee chairman, Liberal Bill Heffernan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heffernan: </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recommendations of the Liberal-Labor committee are not enough to save this from being a very bad bill that will trample on long-held civil liberties and democratic rights. The committee's recommendations are just tweaking around the edges - they do not fix the substantive problems of this bill. The Australian Greens are particularly concerned about the no-go zones, preventative detention orders and biometric data and we will be moving much more substantive amendments when the bill is debated next week. Trashing legal protections and freedoms will not make Australians safer. The Labor party needs to realise this and stop waving through draconian laws without proper scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The propositions that are being put by members operates are simply false. They are simply false.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More questions on the RET. Journalists at the club want to know whether Macfarlaneis actually serious when he says the starting point for the talks is the real 20% (given Labor has already said no and the renewables industry has said a cut of that magnitude will cripple the sector.) He says he is serious about that being the starting point. The industry minister says the Coalition did not sign up to a 27% RET (which it effectively is now, largely due to a fall in demand for energy) - it signed up to a 20% RET. He's also pressed on why he's keeping the household scheme. Macfarlanesays that's where the government sees the growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.24pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlane is asked by a journalist from China's Xinhua news agency about what he wants out of the looming free trade agreement with Beijing. He says in portfolio terms, he wants more access for processed food, componentary and services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlane is also in reassurance mode about submarines. He's arguing that whatever decision ultimately gets made - there will be more jobs in South Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There haven't been submarines built in South Australia for almost 15 years, so there aren't jobs that are going to disappear as a result of a decision being made to buy a submarine overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, there will be new jobs in South Australia, highly paid jobs, because wherever those submarines are built, one thing is for sure that the highly skilled, highly sophisticated requirements in terms of weapons systems and defence systems and all the electronics that go into it have to be fitted in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those systems, if not all of them, will be sourced from America, and the only place they will be able to be fitted will be in SA - so there will be long-term new highly paid jobs, both in terms of maintenance, about you also in terms of fitout.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where would any of us be without Daniel Hurst? I'm in his debt. I'd be more effusive but we need to track back to the industry minister at the National Press Club, because Macfarlaneis outlining the government's standing start position in negotiating with the ALP to try and strike a compromise on the future of the renewable energy target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics Live readers probably know that negotiations are about to begin to try and mop up the mess the Abbott government created for itself when it asked a self-declared climate sceptic to review the RET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlaneis using his NPC outing to announce some of the terms of engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can say, but I have today, along with Greg Hunt, delivered a letter to the opposition outlining the basis to our negotiation which will start at 3.30 this afternoon, and that basis is that we will maintain RET at 20% real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, there will be no change to the household photovoltaic scheme. That is they will be able to continue as they can under the legislation, and that we will exempt from the target all energy intensive trade-exposed industries as currently defined in the act, and that that includes, of course, aluminium, but a number of other industries with I are under pressure and the jobs in those industries are under pressure, from costs overall and so maintaining pressure on those industries by maintaining them in the RET is illogical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will also be asking that as a result of these negotiations that the two-yearly reviews cease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Labor has already agreed to exempt aluminium. But it has been clear over the past few weeks that it will not cop a real 20%. In an interview with me recently, Shortensaid: &quot;A real 20% would be a massive cut.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortenanswers a question about today's inflation numbers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're always pleased if numbers are lower rather than higher but I live in the real world and I talk to real Australians. Real Australians are concerned that their cost of living is going up, not down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, the real statisticians at the Australian Bureau of Statistics today reported that the consumer price index rose 0.5% in the September quarter, following a rise of 0.5% in the June quarter. The year-on-year figure is 2.3%, down from 3% previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a breakdown from the ABS :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant price rises this quarter were for fruit (+14.7%), new dwelling purchase by owner-occupiers (+1.1%), property rates and charges (+6.3%) and other services in respect of motor vehicles (+5.8%). These rises were partially offset by falls in electricity (-5.1%) and automotive fuel (-2.5%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures price change for consumption goods and services acquired by Australian resident households. The Australian Government repealed carbon pricing with effect from 1 July 2014. It is not possible to quantify the impact of removing the carbon price on the price change measured by the CPI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cost of living is still a potent political issue, according to an Essential poll published yesterday. Two-thirds of respondents to that survey felt electricity costs had worsened in the past year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole review cost $283,000, but officials were at pains to point out that Spurr was one of about 15 subject experts appointed by the two curriculum reviewers Kevin Donnelly and Ken Wiltshire - not directly by the government.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's translate this episode a bit. Albo is bruised and upset because Whitlam has died. Many Labor people are deeply upset. I can absolutely understand this intervention this morning from the Labor perspective, this is cheeky from the Greens; and Albanesehere is just saying what he thinks, not running some cute tactic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the episode also gives us a neat little insight into just how hard the combat is in the inner city for progressive votes between Labor and the Greens. The Greens are taking no prisoners when it comes to courting disaffected Labor types. And the disaffected types are there for the taking, given Bill Shorten'sdetermination to project and pitch to the political centre on issues like national security and military engagement in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens political party put up, authorised by Lee Rhiannon on a website, an image of Gough Whitlam, &quot;Vale Gough Whitlam,&quot; next to the Greens party political logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that that is cheap, opportunistic and offensive, given that Gough Whitlam was a Labor man his entire life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gough Whitlam understood that you needed to seize power and be in Government to make a difference to this nation and he did just that between 1972 and 1975. He understood and said very explicitly on so many occasions that he didn't want to be just a party of protest, he wanted to be a party of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd say to Christine Milne and to the Greens, including Lee Rhiannon who authorised this, the Senator from NSW, and Adam Bandt, just do the right thing, pull it down and admit that it was an error of judgment. That the appropriate thing to do, that's the respectful thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What do you find so offensive, the fact they used it with their party logo? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clearly are trying to appropriate Gough Whitlam's legacy for the Greens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way the ICC works, I need to name specific individuals and I have named the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and all 19 members of his Cabinet, including the immigration minister, Scott Morrison. In my application to the prosecutor, I have specifically identified offences, crimes against humanity such as the forced relocation of people, obviously to the Republic of Nauru and to Papua New Guinea but also there have been repeated instances of forced relocation of people back to areas from which they claim to be fleeing persecution and in particular Sri Lanka. I've also identified the inhuman conditions within detention centres and other matters that I ask her to look into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the prosecutor does from here remains to be seen. The ball's very much in her court but I hope that she will respond to this request and will promptly investigate these matters and will ultimately make a recommendation that the names be given to the pretrial chamber and that the International Criminal Court commence proceedings against the prime minister and the 19 members of his Cabinet. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-Admiral Griggs: Iraq will be a long campaign  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroyasks about the very first combat mission over Iraq, where no targets were engaged. Griggssays there is a senior Australian defence person embedded in the chain of command who ensures Australian contributions are in the national interest. It was decided in that particular instance that the risk of collateral damage was too great, and the Australian official invoked a red card. Of 56 missions - three thus far have involved engaging targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does this red card system work? Griggssays it's a process ensuring Australians remain within the rules of engagement and avoid collateral damage. Conroyasks whether Australia's attitude to collateral damage is reflected commonly across the coalition group or whether we have a higher threshold. Griggsdeclines to answer that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroywants particulars on the legal authority. Are we operating on a template legal arrangement or do we have our own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been invited to operate and we have clearance to operate. Broadly, it's the same (as other partners in the coalition).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggsdoes not want to address details. He says the legal authority is a sensitive issue with the Iraqis, so he'd prefer not to comment. He says the ADF is satisfied Australian personnel will have all the necessary immunities and protections before deployment. Conroy asks whether the legal protections will stand in Iraqi law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroythen asks how long this mission is expected to continue. Griggsflicks that to the minister, David Johnston. He says speculation about duration is unhelpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What will be defined as success in degrading and disrupting ISIS? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays this will be a long campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice Admiral Griggssays broadly, Iraq is currently under the influence of three military organisations. The Peshmerga, the Iraqi security forces, and ISIS - active in the west and north west, through the Euphrates Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is ongoing heavy fighting in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays the air campaign is having a significant effecton how ISIS does its business. He says the air campaign has curtailed the freedom of movement of the militants. They are not making progress. They are now contracting into urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That complicates the targeting of the air campaign. It's a challenge if they contract into urban areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Is Baghdad in danger of falling? Or is that a media beat-up? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think for about five months now people have been saying Baghdad will fall next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's overblown. The disposition around Baghdad is relatively stable and has been for some time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uhlmann also asks Shortenabout ebola, and the Abbott government's approach to the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shorten: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What leaves a lot of ordinary Australians scratching their heads is this. The government has been willing to lean forward on international matters on other occasions but it doesn't take a Rhodes scholarship to work out if you don't deal with this deadly disease at the pount of outbreak and if it is allowed to spread we will need more costly solutions down the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Ebola is no challenge for Australia and if it is we just wait until it reaches Papua New Guinea to deal with it, to me, is a very dangerous idea. To me, this is a clear case where you should help do what you can now to avoid it being a much bigger problem down the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: And do you believe that immigration should have a greater hand in the border protection of this? It seems to be a bit of a tussle going on in cabinet over the moment over who has responsibility? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I've read about a split emerging in the government about biosecurity. It seems to me that the insiders would say this was another Scott Morrison land grab at the expense of his colleagues. For me though, the real issue here is biosecurity, which helps protect our agricultural industries, for example, has a scientific role as well as a compliance role. I'm not sure that just moving everything into Customs would help our farming communities be secure from international diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Just for the record, the weekly Essential poll released yesterday afternoon found that 58% of voters believe the government is currently doing enough to help fight ebola. Only 21% think it's not doing enough.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the day still finding its feet, the Labor leader Bill Shorten has called by the ABC studios to reflect on Whitlam. Shorten'shost, Chris Uhlmann, would prefer to hear something more than generalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortenis asked about lessons from the Whitlamperiod. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did his homework. He spent years and years preparing his and Labor's ideas for government. I think that is one of the big lessons. He used his years in opposition. So my challenge, and the lesson for me, from Gough Whitlam the opposition leader, is let us use this time now between now and the next election to have a view of Australia not just at the next election but what sort of country we want to be in 2024.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Do you think that Tony Abbott would disagree with any of those things? Aren't all of those things really motherhood statements? How do you make those real? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well there's about three questions in that. First of all, whether or not Tony Abbott rhetorically agrees or disagrees you have to look at his actions. We are not moving the country forward when we're cutting access to healthcare. We are not moving the country forward when we're making it harder for kids to go to university. We're not moving the country forward when we're turning our back in terms of building modern infrastructure, the NBN, which allows this country to engage more with the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>

They seem to be now more than $2bn. The prime minister will make a statement to the House this morning on the enduring desirability of letting businesses develop things without having to deal with pesky governments. After that, eleven bills will be introduced to repeal other bills. Proper debate on this issue will occur next week. Apparently there is to be a spring repeal day, bring Zyrtec and a packed lunch.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The Australian also says the prime minister will delay imposing additional curbs on foreign investment in farmland until after the agreement is signed. Perhaps I'm very thick but I don't quite grasp that last point: free trade deals generally cover exhaustively all elements of foreign investment. I'm not sure how this gets addressed later on.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation has announced it hopes to begin testing two experimental Ebola vaccines in west Africa by January and may have a blood serum available for use in Liberia within two weeks as it presses the search for medical treatments to stop the spread of the disease. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's health agency said it aimed to begin testing the two vaccines in the new year on more than 20,000 frontline health care workers and others in west Africa - a bigger rollout than previously envisioned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Marie Paule Kieny, an assistant director general at the WHO, acknowledged there were many &quot;ifs&quot; remaining and &quot;still a possibility that it [a vaccine] will fail&quot;. But she sketched out a much broader experiment than was imagined only six months ago, saying the WHO hoped to dispense tens of thousands of doses in the first months of the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are quite large trials,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kieny said in remarks reported by the BBC that a serum was also being developed for use in Liberia based on antibodies extracted from the blood of Ebola survivors. &quot;There are partnerships which are starting to be put in place to have capacity in the three countries to safely extract plasma and make preparation that can be used for the treatment of infective patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The partnership which is moving the quickest will be in Liberia where we hope that in the coming weeks there will be facilities set up to collect the blood, treat the blood and be able to process it for use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said the agency expected 20,000 vaccinations in January and similar numbers in the months afterwards using the trial products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An effective vaccine would still not in itself be enough to stop the outbreak but could protect the medical workers who are central to the effort. More than 200 of them have died of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real-world testing in west Africa will go forward only if the vaccines prove safe and trigger an adequate immune-system response in volunteers during clinical trials that are either under way or planned in Europe, Africa and the US. The preliminary safety data is expected to become available by December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the vaccines that Kieny mentioned, Okairos AG, is being developed by the US National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline from a modified chimpanzee cold virus and an Ebola protein. It is being made in Rome, according to GSK, with clinical trials under way in Britain and Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have other vaccine facilities around the world and we are seeing what we can do to ramp up production to commercial scale,&quot; said Mary Anne Rhyne, Glaxo's US director of external communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second frontrunner, developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and known as VSV-EBOV, has been sent to the US Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on healthy volunteers. It would also be tested shortly among volunteers in Switzerland, Germany, Gabon and Kenya, Kieny said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately the Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals announced on Tuesday that it had begun limited manufacturing of a therapeutic targeting the Ebola-Guinea virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tekmira said on Tuesday that the new product, part of its TKM-Ebola programme, would be available by early December. But it did not specify how many doses it was making, or whether it was a drug or vaccine. Its TKM-Ebola programme is aimed at developing a treatment to stop the virus replicating in an infected person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Medicines Agency said on Monday that it was ready to offer Ebola treatments and vaccines the benefits of &quot;orphan&quot; drug status - including extended market exclusivity - in a bid to encourage their development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapp Biopharmaceutical - which gave its experimental Ebola treatment ZMapp to American medical workers Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who recovered after contracting Ebola in Liberia, and to at least one Spanish priest, who died - said it had begun manufacturing the drug using conventional methods that would produce greater quantities for more human testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak in west Africa has killed more than 4,500 people, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, since it began 10 months ago. Experts have said the world could see 10,000 new cases a week in two months if authorities do not take stronger steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone said on Tuesday that the number of infected people in the country's western region was soaring, with more than 20 deaths a day. The region is on the opposite side of the country from where the first cases emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Tuesday, WHO's Chaib promised a thorough public audit of the agency's early missteps in responding to the Ebola crisis but said for the moment &quot;our focus is on the response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More questions on the RET. Journalists at the club want to know whether Macfarlaneis actually serious when he says the starting point for the talks is the real 20% (given Labor has already said no and the renewables industry has said a cut of that magnitude will cripple the sector.) He says he is serious about that being the starting point. The industry minister says the Coalition did not sign up to a 27% RET (which it effectively is now, largely due to a fall in demand for energy) - it signed up to a 20% RET. He's also pressed on why he's keeping the household scheme. Macfarlanesays that's where the government sees the growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.24pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlane is asked by a journalist from China's Xinhua news agency about what he wants out of the looming free trade agreement with Beijing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.21pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlane is also in reassurance mode about submarines. He's arguing that whatever decision ultimately gets made - there will be more jobs in South Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There haven't been submarines built in South Australia for almost 15 years, so there aren't jobs that are going to disappear as a result of a decision being made to buy a submarine overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, there will be new jobs in South Australia, highly paid jobs, because wherever those submarines are built, one thing is for sure that the highly skilled, highly sophisticated requirements in terms of weapons systems and defence systems and all the electronics that go into it have to be fitted in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of those systems, if not all of them, will be sourced from America, and the only place they will be able to be fitted will be in SA - so there will be long-term new highly paid jobs, both in terms of maintenance, about you also in terms of fitout.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government reveals its negotiating stance on the RET  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where would any of us be without Daniel Hurst? I'm in his debt. I'd be more effusive but we need to track back to the industry minister at the National Press Club, because Macfarlaneis outlining the government's standing start position in negotiating with the ALP to try and strike a compromise on the future of the renewable energy target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics Live readers probably know that negotiations are about to begin to try and mop up the mess the Abbott government created for itself when it asked a self-declared climate sceptic to review the RET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macfarlaneis using his NPC outing to announce some of the terms of engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can say, but I have today, along with Greg Hunt, delivered a letter to the opposition outlining the basis to our negotiation which will start at 3.30 this afternoon, and that basis is that we will maintain RET at 20% real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, there will be no change to the household photovoltaic scheme. That is they will be able to continue as they can under the legislation, and that we will exempt from the target all energy intensive trade-exposed industries as currently defined in the act, and that that includes, of course, aluminium, but a number of other industries with I are under pressure and the jobs in those industries are under pressure, from costs overall and so maintaining pressure on those industries by maintaining them in the RET is illogical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will also be asking that as a result of these negotiations that the two-yearly reviews cease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Labor has already agreed to exempt aluminium. But it has been clear over the past few weeks that it will not cop a real 20%. In an interview with me recently, Shortensaid: &quot;A real 20% would be a massive cut. The renewable energy industry has made it very clear that it wouldn't have a future under a real 20%.&quot; If you click through to that Shorteninterview, it will give you some context on the real 20% if you haven't been following this particular issue.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're always pleased if numbers are lower rather than higher but I live in the real world and I talk to real Australians. Real Australians are concerned that their cost of living is going up, not down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, the real statisticians at the Australian Bureau of Statistics today reported that the consumer price index rose 0.5% in the September quarter, following a rise of 0.5% in the June quarter. The year-on-year figure is 2.3%, down from 3% previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a breakdown from the ABS :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant price rises this quarter were for fruit (+14.7%), new dwelling purchase by owner-occupiers (+1.1%), property rates and charges (+6.3%) and other services in respect of motor vehicles (+5.8%). These rises were partially offset by falls in electricity (-5.1%) and automotive fuel (-2.5%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures price change for consumption goods and services acquired by Australian resident households. The Australian Government repealed carbon pricing with effect from 1 July 2014.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's translate this episode a bit. Albo is bruised and upset because Whitlam has died. Many Labor people are deeply upset. I can absolutely understand this intervention this morning from the Labor perspective, this is cheeky from the Greens; and Albanesehere is just saying what he thinks, not running some cute tactic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the episode also gives us a neat little insight into just how hard the combat is in the inner city for progressive votes between Labor and the Greens. The Greens are taking no prisoners when it comes to courting disaffected Labor types. And the disaffected types are there for the taking, given Bill Shorten'sdetermination to project and pitch to the political centre on issues like national security and military engagement in Iraq.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Greens political party put up, authorised by Lee Rhiannon on a website, an image of Gough Whitlam, &quot;Vale Gough Whitlam,&quot; next to the Greens party political logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that that is cheap, opportunistic and offensive, given that Gough Whitlam was a Labor man his entire life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gough Whitlam understood that you needed to seize power and be in Government to make a difference to this nation and he did just that between 1972 and 1975. He understood and said very explicitly on so many occasions that he didn't want to be just a party of protest, he wanted to be a party of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd say to Christine Milne and to the Greens, including Lee Rhiannon who authorised this, the Senator from NSW, and Adam Bandt, just do the right thing, pull it down and admit that it was an error of judgment. That the appropriate thing to do, that's the respectful thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What do you find so offensive, the fact they used it with their party logo? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clearly are trying to appropriate Gough Whitlam's legacy for the Greens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have today made a formal request to the prosecutor at the international criminal court in the Hague in the Netherlands asking her to investigate specific individuals and in particular that they might have contravened article 7 of the Rome statute, and committed crimes against humanity, by the way they have treated asylum seekers attempting to come to Australia over a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way the ICC works, I need to name specific individuals and I have named the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and all 19 members of his Cabinet, including the immigration minister, Scott Morrison. In my application to the prosecutor, I have specifically identified offences, crimes against humanity such as the forced relocation of people, obviously to the Republic of Nauru and to Papua New Guinea but also there have been repeated instances of forced relocation of people back to areas from which they claim to be fleeing persecution and in particular Sri Lanka. I've also identified the inhuman conditions within detention centres and other matters that I ask her to look into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the prosecutor does from here remains to be seen. The ball's very much in her court but I hope that she will respond to this request and will promptly investigate these matters and will ultimately make a recommendation that the names be given to the pretrial chamber and that the International Criminal Court commence proceedings against the prime minister and the 19 members of his Cabinet. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-Admiral Griggs: Iraq will be a long campaign  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroyasks about the very first combat mission over Iraq, where no targets were engaged. Griggssays there is a senior Australian defence person embedded in the chain of command who ensures Australian contributions are in the national interest. It was decided in that particular instance that the risk of collateral damage was too great, and the Australian official invoked a red card. Of 56 missions - three thus far have involved engaging targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does this red card system work? Griggssays it's a process ensuring Australians remain within the rules of engagement and avoid collateral damage. Conroyasks whether Australia's attitude to collateral damage is reflected commonly across the coalition group or whether we have a higher threshold. Griggsdeclines to answer that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroywants particulars on the legal authority. Are we operating on a template legal arrangement or do we have our own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been invited to operate and we have clearance to operate. Broadly, it's the same (as other partners in the coalition).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggsdoes not want to address details. He says the legal authority is a sensitive issue with the Iraqis, so he'd prefer not to comment. He says the ADF is satisfied Australian personnel will have all the necessary immunities and protections before deployment. Conroy asks whether the legal protections will stand in Iraqi law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conroythen asks how long this mission is expected to continue. Griggsflicks that to the minister, David Johnston. He says speculation about duration is unhelpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What will be defined as success in degrading and disrupting ISIS? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays this will be a long campaign.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice Admiral Griggssays broadly, Iraq is currently under the influence of three military organisations. The Peshmerga, the Iraqi security forces, and ISIS - active in the west and north west, through the Euphrates Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is ongoing heavy fighting in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggssays the air campaign is having a significant effecton how ISIS does its business. He says the air campaign has curtailed the freedom of movement of the militants. They are not making progress. They are now contracting into urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That complicates the targeting of the air campaign. It's a challenge if they contract into urban areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Is Baghdad in danger of falling? Or is that a media beat-up? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griggs: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think for about five months now people have been saying Baghdad will fall next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's overblown. The disposition around Baghdad is relatively stable and has been for some time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What leaves a lot of ordinary Australians scratching their heads is this. The government has been willing to lean forward on international matters on other occasions but it doesn't take a Rhodes scholarship to work out if you don't deal with this deadly disease at the pount of outbreak and if it is allowed to spread we will need more costly solutions down the track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that Ebola is no challenge for Australia and if it is we just wait until it reaches Papua New Guinea to deal with it, to me, is a very dangerous idea.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I've read about a split emerging in the government about biosecurity. It seems to me that the insiders would say this was another Scott Morrison land grab at the expense of his colleagues. For me though, the real issue here is biosecurity, which helps protect our agricultural industries, for example, has a scientific role as well as a compliance role. I'm not sure that just moving everything into Customs would help our farming communities be secure from international diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Just for the record, the weekly Essential poll released yesterday afternoon found that 58% of voters believe the government is currently doing enough to help fight ebola. Only 21% think it's not doing enough.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the day still finding its feet, the Labor leader Bill Shorten has called by the ABC studios to reflect on Whitlam. Shorten'shost, Chris Uhlmann, would prefer to hear something more than generalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortenis asked about lessons from the Whitlamperiod. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did his homework. He spent years and years preparing his and Labor's ideas for government. I think that is one of the big lessons. He used his years in opposition. So my challenge, and the lesson for me, from Gough Whitlam the opposition leader, is let us use this time now between now and the next election to have a view of Australia not just at the next election but what sort of country we want to be in 2024.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Do you think that Tony Abbott would disagree with any of those things? Aren't all of those things really motherhood statements? How do you make those real? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well there's about three questions in that. First of all, whether or not Tony Abbott rhetorically agrees or disagrees you have to look at his actions. We are not moving the country forward when we're cutting access to healthcare. We are not moving the country forward when we're making it harder for kids to go to university. We're not moving the country forward when we're turning our back in terms of building modern infrastructure, the NBN, which allows this country to engage more with the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: When will you put meat on the bones of these statements? When will we see the policies that will take you into the next election? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will reveal our policies well before the next election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning everyone, and welcome to Wednesday in the national capital. Wednesday is still gradually unwinding from Tuesday. The former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlamdied yesterday, at 98. The newspapers and news websites this morning are still dominated by tributes and analysis of a politician who divided national affairs in life, and united it in death. Lots of good pieces around examining both the very best and the very worst of EGW. </SPAN></P>

They seem to be now more than $2bn. The prime minister will make a statement to the House this morning on the enduring desirability of letting businesses develop things without having to deal with pesky governments. After that, eleven bills will be introduced to repeal other bills. Proper debate on this issue will occur next week. Apparently there is to be a spring repeal day, bring Zyrtec and a packed lunch.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The Australian also says the prime minister will delay imposing additional curbs on foreign investment in farmland until after the agreement is signed. Perhaps I'm very thick but I don't quite grasp that last point: free trade deals generally cover exhaustively all elements of foreign investment. I'm not sure how this gets addressed later on.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola was on Tuesday given the all clear when health authorities said she no longer has any traces of the virus in her blood after more than two weeks in hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several successive tests for Teresa Romero Ramos have come back negative, said Jos&eacute; Ram&oacute;n Arribas from Madrid's Carlos III Hospital. &quot;We consider that she has met the criteria for being cured,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Patients with Ebola can be completely cured and live a normal life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is expected to remain in hospital for at least two more weeks to recover. &quot;It's one thing to test negative for Ebola in the blood, and another to talk about what the virus has done to her,&quot; said her doctor, Fernando de la Calle. Romero Ramos, 44, was treated with a serum containing antibodies from Ebola survivors and anti-viral drugs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early October Romero Ramos tested positive for Ebola, becoming the first known person in the current outbreak to contract the virus outside west Africa. The auxiliary nurse had been part of a team attending to two Ebola patients who had been evacuated from west Africa to Madrid for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After it emerged that Romero Ramos had been complaining of a fever for nearly a week before being tested for Ebola, health authorities began monitoring more than 80 people who had been in contact with her prior to her diagnosis. Fifteen people, including her husband and three workers from a hair salon where Romero Ramos went for an appointment in late September, remain in quarantine in Madrid's Carlos III hospital. None have shown any symptoms to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, family friend Teresa Mesa said that the past few weeks had been incredibly trying for Romero Ramos and her family. &quot;There was a moment when she thought she was going to die,&quot; said Mesa. In an effort to not upset her during her recovery, her friends and family had not yet told her that her dog, Excalibur, had been put down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the tense weeks that followed the nurse's diagnosis, healthcare workers spoke out about how ill-prepared the country had been to face the threat of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the association that represents nurses in Spain backed the claims with a report detailing what they saw as shortcomings in how authorities had managed the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were so many risk factors,&quot; said M&aacute;ximo Gonz&aacute;lez Jurado of the Consejo General de Enfermer&iacute;a. &quot;But did authorities take all necessary measures to minimise these risks? Our report says they did not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on first-hand interviews with nursing staff at Madrid's Carlos III hospital, the 148-page report paints a picture of scant training, missing protocols and substandard equipment. One nurse, just back from vacation, was put on the night shift to attend to a patient with Ebola with no training. Of the six nurses who treated one of the Ebola patients, only four had received 30 minutes of training. Just two of them had ever practiced putting on or taking off the protective equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff was not trained on how to handle or dispose of any of the potentially infectious waste materials from the rooms. The two sanitary workers tasked with removing the body of one of the Ebola patients after he died from the virus were not given any special training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also details various flaws in the equipment, from gloves that were shorter than required, goggles that fogged up and antiseptic that had to be replaced after it emerged that it could create small holes in the protective suits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gonz&aacute;lez Jurado pointed to these risks to refute the claim by Madrid health authorities that Romero Ramos may have contracted the disease by touching her face while still wearing her gloves. &quot;We'll never know how Romero Ramos was infected with Ebola.&quot; He said that all of the information collected would be submitted to Spain's general prosecutor, who is looking into how Ebola was managed in Spain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Editor's note: a spokeswoman for the mayor of Dallas has contacted the Guardian to dispute aspects of this story. A full update will be posted when further reporting is complete.                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of Liberia telephoned the mayor of Dallas and apologised for the fact that the Ebola virus had transferred from her country to his city and infected Americans, the mayor said during a conference call with religious leaders in Texas on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor, Mike Rawlings, said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf had said she felt accountable for the situation in the Texan city, where a man who had recently returned from Liberia infected two nurses who treated him before he died, according to two people on the conference call.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor said that there was a call to him personally, and that the Liberian president had mentioned apologies, and, in his words, a little bit of responsibility that this was even happening,&quot; Rex Howe, a pastor at Scofield Memorial church, told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr John Carlo, a former medical director for Dallas county and the chief executive of an Aids prevention non-profit, added that Rawlings said he &quot;did not accept&quot; the president's apology. &quot;He feels that this is a global community, and there was no fault by the Liberian people,&quot; said Carlo, who addressed the faith leaders after the mayor. &quot;I think that was a good message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on 8 October, almost three weeks after flying to the US from Monrovia, the capital of the west African state, where thousands of people have been killed by an outbreak of Ebola. He had come into contact with a woman there infected with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two nurses who helped treat Duncan before he died at Texas Health Dallas Presbyterian hospital, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, became the first two people known to have contracted Ebola on US soil. They are being treated in specialist facilities in Georgia and Maryland. Pham's condition was lowered by health officials on Friday from good to fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howe, the pastor, said the mayor had also recounted telling Sirleaf that once Dallas had taken stock of its &quot;failures and successes&quot; in dealing with the virus, &quot;there may be things we can share with both the US and the rest of the world about what we've learned, about what to do and what not to do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to confirm that Sirleaf had called the mayor, Gabriel Williams, a spokesman for the Liberian embassy in Washington, said: &quot;I wouldn't be able to comment on that right now.&quot; A public relations firm handling media for Rawlings did not return requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings also disclosed during the call that the first of 48 people being isolated and monitored by authorities for signs of Ebola, after coming into contact with Duncan when he became ill, had emerged from quarantine after the required 21 days without symptoms. The man, who was not identified, was said have visited Duncan's apartment after he began feeling sick on 24 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan's fiancee, Louise Troh, remains quarantined until the end of the weekend. Troh's 13-year-old son, Duncan's nephew, and another man - all of whom were staying with Duncan in the same apartment - are also scheduled to emerge from the same restrictions at the same time as Troh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 100 faith leaders were invited to join the conference call on Friday afternoon. Participants received an email invitation from Amanda Sanchez, Rawlings's community outreach coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings was also said to have reiterated a warning he has made elsewhere that &quot;we're not out of the woods yet&quot; and that another diagnosis should not come as a surprise. &quot;Honestly, we should expect to see another case or two,&quot; Howe recalled the mayor saying.</SPAN></P>

Why doesn't each of the EU countries adopt an African nation, to make a difference by practical help, leadership, technology and encouragement? Scotland adopted Malawi a while ago. It would be interesting to see which EU countries could make the most difference to its adoptee - and all would learn from a competitive spirit and from each other. Africa need not be like it is. It has the long-term capability to be a great resource in the world economy as a supplier and as a market. It could also help relieve the problems associated with migration to the EU (Record numbers of migrants have died in the Mediterranean, 21 October). If Africa's economies could be fully developed, perhaps its peoples would not need to risk death to escape. Frank Cannon Glasgow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Simply sending money will not work, not just because so much will be skimmed off to support corrupt politicians, but because so often countries in that region do not have the capacity to implement top-down solutions. In my own experience working on HIV/Aids in Malawi, Unicef made the fundamental error of insisting on imposing a grand strategy - in a country without the framework of governance to implement it. What the country did and does have is a huge number of dedicated and capable people who would be able to cope if only they had the support they needed to do so. Simple measures such as providing health workers with bicycles to travel between villages has a vastly greater potential to help in a country without adequate public transport.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YESTERDAY THE UNITED States Military reiterated its vow to remain in the combined civil-military operation efforts in fighting the Ebola virus disease in the country. The commitment was made when the U.S. Major General, Darryl Williams who served in a pioneering position as the first Commander of the U.S. Military in Liberia for five weeks formally introduced the incoming Commander of the U.S. led Operation United Shield, Gary J. Volesky to the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMONG OTHER THINGS, Major General Williams announced the turning over of the Tubmanburg, Bomi County Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) this week while that of Sinje, Grand Cape Mount County will be completed and dedicated next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAMS said the U.S. Military Operation is prepared to work with the government in eradicating Ebola and sharing its expertise with the Liberian military and described Defense Minister Samukai's role in this mission as extraordinary because he has opened the Liberian military facility to be used for the combined efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEFENSE MINISTER SAMUKAI also emphasized how his soldiers were very keen on learning how to construct, manage, and maintain the facilities as well as to benefit from the quality of medical healthcare services provided, noting that it is an opportunity to shadow and learn as well as build the capacities that will benefit the AFL for a long term. Minister Samukai said given the challenges of Ebola, these trainings will provide a level of coordination and support. He also said the kind of partnership developed will be enduring as the Ministry of National Defense appreciates and looks forward to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO DATE, AMONG the plans of the U.S. Military operation which is beefed up by the AFL engineering unit, nine ETUs are to be constructed in seven counties with the first three located in Bomi, Grand Cape Mount and Grand Bassa to be completed and turned over to the government of Liberia and USAID before the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDEED, THIS PARTNERSHIP is worth commending and it is our hope that the Liberian military specifically the engineering unit will pay keen attention so that its capacity can be built to tackle pandemic recurrence head-on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE CONSTRUCTION OF ETUs, its management and maintenance strategy we believe will be different from the normal tents' construction and many thanks to the US operation team that this time it is getting Liberians involved so that we too can benefit and help ourselves in future case management which to us is a long term moral investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOWBEIT, THIS WILL be a delusion if we do not consider how weak our health care delivery system was before the crippling of the outbreak of the epidemic which has left scar in the system. So to know that mobile laboratories and quality health care services are being set up in collaboration with our army's engineering unit is a welcoming news and hope that those structures remain so that our soldiers can continue to apply the skills and serve as trainer of trainers to our healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE SHARE OUR National Defense's gratitude in this coordination and the level of support being provided by the U.S. Government especially in these times that Ebola has engulfed our country and hope as Minister Samukai noted, the benefits will be a long term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese President Xi Jinping has stated emphatically that his country, the People's Republic of China, &quot;stands with Liberia in exerting every effort to defeat the deadly Ebola Virus.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Xi Jinping made this statement when he received the newly appointed Liberian Ambassador to China, His Excellency Mr. Dudley McKinley Thomas. Ambassador Thomas who is one of Liberia's most experienced diplomats and is a senior Liberian Ambassador presented his Letters of Credence to the Chinese President at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on October 15,2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese President welcomed the Liberian Ambassador to China and went on to say: &quot;Mr. Ambassador, I am certain that by the mere fact President Sirleaf chose you to be her Ambassador to China shows that she has great confidence in you&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Xi Jinping assured Ambassador Thomas that he will receive the full cooperation of all of the various agencies and other authorities of the Chinese government in helping to ensure the success of his mission. The President then concluded by asking the Liberian Ambassador to convey his personal best wishes to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and to inform her that China stands with Liberia and will do whatever it takes to help Liberia defeat the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Ambassador Thomas in presenting his Letters of Credence to the Chinese Leader convey heartfelt thanks and appreciation of on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Government and the People of Liberia to China for the solidarity demonstrated by the Chinese Government, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, in providing urgently needed assistance, in various forms, including direct financial assistance to the Government of Liberia, to combat the deadly Ebola virus which has claimed and is still claiming so many precious lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. President, China is a proven-true friend of Liberia and of Africa. Indeed your nation continues to demonstrate that, its multi-faceted bilateral cooperation with Liberia, is undergirded by mutual respect for each other's sovereignty, and is strongly embedded in a genuine sense of true partnership&quot;, Ambassador Thomas remarked. He asserted it is the true partnership from which the good relations between both countries draw its strength.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing Lives International Ministries (CLIM) has continued its fourth round of distribution of Anti-Ebola sanitizing materials in the Block Factory Community located in the township of Duazon on the Robertsfield Highway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing Lives International has already held series of distributions in the Duazon Community as part of its objective of impacting over 150 homes; especially underprivileged women household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During its 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds of distribution, CLIM executives disclosed that they had developed a work-plan that would reach out to over 150 under-privileged residents in the Duazon Community situation along the Robertsfield Highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of that commitment, the non-governmental institution has already provided sanitizing and anti-Ebola materials in three communities with the Block Factory Community being the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of CLIM reiterated that the donation is their own way of identifying with lee-privileged women and children who are direct victims of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking further, the local Coordinator of CLIM, Mr. Martin L. Fleming, encouraged women of the Block Factory Community to make a very good use of the donation because according to him, EBOLA does not discriminate; whether rich or poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola does not distinguish between the little ones so we all must fight to prevent this killer disease which has engulfed our land,&quot; he stated. Mr. Fleming also extended his thanks and appreciation to the Grand Lutheran Church, Sturgis Southern Dakota, USA who he said are the prime sponsors of the donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation was received by Mrs. Jonna Hutchinson on behalf of the people of the Block Factory Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the local coordinator of Changing Lives International Ministries Inc (CLIM) has called on residents of the community to embrace would-be survivors. He said, it is about time that Liberia redirects their interest in the fight against the Ebola virus by welcoming those declared free from the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned against discrimination and stigmatization, stressing that the effect of the virus has a big psychological effect on the person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must show love to our brothers and sisters who have survived from Ebola. They need our support to continue their survival; if we start to castigate, neglect and stigmatize them then we will lose the Ebola fight,&quot; Mr. Fleming warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted that the Ebola Awareness will continue in keeping with the fight against the virus. They vowed to intensify their outreach program which accordingly is intended to reach more than 150 families especially women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians and their international partners have intensified the fight against the deadly outbreak of the EBOLA virus which has led to the massive reduction of new cases across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing Lives International Ministries is a local and international NGO in the drive to buttress government's efforts and contribute to the process of nation building. Already, CLIM has constructed a 7-room building in the township of Duazon in the Royal Community. The building is intended to be used as an elementary school. The idea to erect an elementary school in that community was driven from a survey showing that hundreds of children who are of school-going age have less fortunate opportunity to acquire primary education.</SPAN></P>

However, MSF has warned of cross-border activities as the virus has reached its highest peak in neighboring Guinea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen-Johnson-Sirleaf who is visiting health facilities in the northern county of Lofa was informed by health workers in the county that the rate of Ebola has significantly decreased with just six recorded cases at the ETU in Lofa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers at the largest ETU in Foya have complained of food shortage and delay in their salary payment by Government. Information gathered from MSF authorities says there has been significant gain made n the fight against the vicious virus in Lofa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serge St. Louis, MSF Project Coordinator in Lofa disclosed that there have been no new cases in the past three weeks. He said there were ten patients at the ETU in the entire Lofa County over the past three weeks but has decreased to only six since Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, St. Louis has warned of cross-border activities calling on government to be vigilant as the Ebola virus has reached its highest peak along the Liberian-Guinean border. Report says Massanta and Geikaydou near the Liberian border are the highest hit towns in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lofa County is one of Liberia's bordering towns with Guinea and Sierra Leone, the two countries devastatingly affected by the vicious Ebola virus. Latest report suggests that Ebola is raging in Gaikaydou and Massanta close to the Liberian border, hence health observers say for Lofa to be completely clear of the deadly Ebola virus, Liberia's borders must remain closed with other affected neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, President Sirleaf has lauded health workers in Lofa County for their commitment and dedication something that has led to the decrease in the rate of Ebola in their county. The Liberian leader praised those who have dedicated themselves to the fight against the vicious virus saying that government will ensure that health workers receive their just benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf visited several health centers on Monday in Lofa including the largest ETU in Foya, the FoyaBorma Hospital, Holahum Health Center; the Telewoyan Hospital. Telewoyan is the largest referral hospital in the northern county of Lofa and despite the opening of an isolation center, it has not received any Ebola patient, health authorities at the hospital have said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia National Defense and its counterpart, the United States Military, have vowed to remain supportive in the combine efforts in fighting the Ebola virus disease in the country. The Ministry of National Defense which has now drawn down to civil-military activities has a batch of its engineering unit working alongside the U.S. Military to construct nine Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in seven of Liberia's 15 counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the outgoing Commander of the United States Military operations in Liberia, Darryl Williams, the ETU currently constructed in Tubmanburg, Bomi County is expected to be turned over this week while that of Sinje, Grand Cape Mount County will be completed and dedicated sometime next week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Williams who has been setting up the ground and basis for the military operation 'United Shield' as it relates to the expected 3,000 U.S. soldiers in the region expressed gratitude for the extraordinary leadership qualities exhibited during his tenure which sets the condition for onward operations of the U.S. Military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outgoing Major General served in a pioneering position as the first Commander of the U.S. Military in Liberia for five weeks and said &quot;Operation United Shield involves the efforts of the AFL and our team and it wouldn't have happened without united effort.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Williams expressed his commendation yesterday when he formally escorted the incoming Major General Gary Volesky to Liberia's Defense Minister, Brownie J. Samukai touring its Barclay Training Center facilities in Monrovia and thanked him for opening up his headquarters for the U.S. operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incoming Commander of the U.S led Operation United Shield; Major General Volesky described it as an honor to be in Liberia working with the Liberian military to train healthcare workers and to build Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I express my appreciation to the Government and people of Liberia for the opportunity to have a foothold on Liberian soil otherwise we would have remained on the Atlantic,&quot; Volesky, the Commanding General of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and Fort Campbell noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Volesky is a graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, as well as the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base. He holds a Bachelor's degree from Eastern Washington University and a master's degree from Princeton University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief chat, Defense Minister Samukai also injected that the soldiers and sailors of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) were grateful and expressed the AFL preparedness to discharge its assigned humanitarian mission under the scheme of &quot;Operation United Shield&quot;, as a 'Force for Good.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a guided tour with the U.S. Military Commanding Generals, Defense Minister Samukai said the AFL engineering unit is working closely with the US Military in constructing the facilities and setting up of units, specifically those of the Americans accommodating the US service personnel operating in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his soldiers are very keen on learning how to construct, manage, maintain the facilities and will as well benefit from the quality of medical services provided and also have the opportunity to shadow and learn from all that as well as build the capacities that will benefit the AFL for a long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Samukai said given the challenges of Ebola, those trainings that will be provided, level of coordination and support as well as the kind of partnership developed are enduring and added that it will surely be appreciated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issues of laboratories, Minister Samukai said there were already mobile laboratories around the ETU s and are operational while General Williams said the current plan is for the mobile laboratories is that they remain in the country but long term plans in that direction are with the Liberian government and USAID to be decided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OIL companies weighed heavily on the markets yesterday as the recent slump in the price of black gold spooked investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 fell back 43.22 points to 6,267.07, after rising 114 points on Friday - bouncing back from a 15-month low on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldman Sachs cut its earnings estimates for the oil services sector by between 18pc and 22pc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a downbeat note it said: Historical correlations between oil prices and European oil service revenues imply there is a 10pc to 20pc down side potential to revenue from 2014 levels on scenarios of Brent oil prices at $90-$80/bl (per barrel).'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrofac fell 30p to 1030p, Royal Dutch Shell fell 50p to 2099p, Tullow Oil was down 15.5p to 508.5p, and gas giant BG Group dropped 40.5p - or 3.8pc - to 1024.5p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copper prices also eased yesterday as investors braced themselves for disappointing Chinese growth figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punters ditched the red metal as the second biggest economy in the world was expected to admit last night that it is going to miss its full year growth target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Madden, market analyst at IG, added the slowdown in China could not come at a worse time for the oil market, as overproduction from oil-rich nations and declining global demand continues to crush the price of crude oil'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears about the malaise in the eurozone, the crisis in Ukraine and the threat of ebola are just some of the other issues making investors twitchy at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hapless supermarket giant Tesco (up 4.75p to 179.3p) was one of the biggest climbers in the FTSE 100, as investors were cheered by reports that private equity firms are eyeing its &pound;9bn Asian business - and that its accounting black hole may be less than originally stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All eyes will be on Britain's biggest grocer on Thursday - when it is expected to announce a dire set of figures for the first half of the year and provide shareholders with an update on the probe into its &pound;250m accounting scandal. Unsurprisingly Tesco was the most viewed stock among customers of discount broker Hargreaves Lansdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in Spirit Pub Company soared nearly 10pc to 99.75p as investors toasted news of Greene King's improved takeover offer of 109.5p per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said both firms could benefit from the proposed &pound;723m merger, which it estimates will generate &pound;35m in savings. It reckons the deal would boost Sprit's earnings by around 15pc and Greene King's by 12pc. It highlighted other potential benefits such as the chance for Greene King, whose tipples include Old Speckled Hen and Greene King IPA, to sell its beers in Sprit pubs. But investors in Greene King were not so excited by the prospect, with shares nudging up 7p to 775p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group was flying high in the FTSE yesterday (up 11p to 361.4p) after analysts at Liberum highlighted the UK listed firm as its top pick for the European airline sector - alongside budget rivals Ryanair (up 0.14p to 7.1p) and EasyJet (up 22p at 1431p). Liberum said it sees opportunities for the brave', despite sentiment remaining fragile across the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst concerns over ebola, eurozone recession and excess capacity, we believe there are good long term opportunities for investors with high risk tolerances.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broker was less bullish about tarnished engineering powerhouse Rolls-Royce, downgrading it from buy' to hold' and slashing its target price from 1225p to 900p. Investec also lowered its recommendation from buy' to hold', with JP Morgan changing its stance from overweight' to neutral'. Shares eased 14p to 818p having tumbled 11pc on Friday after it issued a profits warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK blue chip blamed deteriorating economic conditions and tighter Russian trade sanctions - with customers in the oil and gas and mining and construction sectors cancelling or delaying orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US stocks had a mixed day. The Dow Jones was weighed down in early trading by IBM, which fell more than 7pc on disappointing quarterly results. But the index bounced back to close 19.26 points up at 16,399.67.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traders screen's turned across red Europe, with German business software-maker SAP issued a profits warning and was the worst performer on the German DAX, which fell 132.5 points - or 1.5pc - to 8,717.8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German markets have been hit by sobering economic data which has raised questions about the resilience of Europe's biggest economy. The French CAC 40 index also fell by more than 1pc to 3991.2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">***</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHARES in Premier Foods jumped more than 12pc to 30.25p. Ahead of the firm's Q3 trading update Thursday, Shore Capital reiterated its buy' rating. But it cautioned that this was with a degree of trepidation, given the weakness of the Q2 trading performance and the clearly challenging grocery market conditions in the UK'. It said it expects the firm to announce a drop in sales of between 3-4pc in the third quarter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST week as I was parking my car a passing youth spat on to the windscreen not an act of aggression at me, but simply a reflex habit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He probably hardly realised what he was doing: this was something he, like many of us, have increasingly seen on the street and in Premier League football matches in recent years, and is a tough guy act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 1960, when my father took me to France for the first time, I asked him the meaning of a public sign that seemed to be everywhere, Defence de Cracher'. It means No Spitting'. He explained that spitting in public was forbidden as it was a cause of the spread of tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years earlier, when he was at medical school, three of his student peers died from TB before the end of the course, as there were no antibiotic treatments until just before 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, tuberculosis was the great fear of all involved in healthcare because of their inevitable exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other day, I read that the number of people diagnosed with TB in England is set to exceed the number of cases in the U.S. within the next year, and this is fuelled by immigration 70 per cent of cases involving people born outside of the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are lucky that most cases of TB, though not all, are cured with a six or 12-month course of three antibiotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, of course, we are in the grip of Ebola, with experts warning that the disease is coming closer to our shores. And how is it spread? Body fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is the time to rise up against young men spitting in the street and on the football pitch if only out of respect for the thousands who have already died from the Ebola virus, or those whose lungs are wrecked by tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TIME may be running out for Andrew Culliford. But ask him whether he'd rather meekly give in to the illness that's killing him or risk taking an unlicensed drug that might stave off its devastating effects, and his answer is unequivocal: he'd take the drug without a second's hesitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 37-year-old fire officer and father-of-one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in July 2011 at the age of just 34. He was told he had just two to five years to live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no cure for the disease, which affects the motor neurons nerve cells that control muscles in the brain and spinal cord. The muscles gradually waste away, affecting the patient's ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, swallow and eventually breathe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a year of his diagnosis, Andrew started losing the strength in his right arm and hand. His speech became slurred, and in 2012 he and Donna married while he could still say his vows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now I have to feed Andrew because the muscles in his tongue and throat have weakened,' says Donna. His speech is very slurred so I often have to interpret what he says to other people. He can't use his arms and is starting to find walking more difficult.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only treatment for MND on the NHS is riluzole, which offers just three extra months of life after it's been taken for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are other drugs that might help. Through his own research, in late 2012 Andrew came across aimspro, which was being tested for neurological conditions such as MND and multiple sclerosis. Former Rugby Union player Joost van der Westhuizen was taking it for his MND after travelling the world looking for a cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We figured he'd be getting the best treatment for the disease, so Andrew wanted to try it,' says Donna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New drugs undergo three stages of testing. In the first, the drug is given in small doses to healthy patients to check for side-effects; then it's given to a larger group of people who have the disease it's been developed for; finally, some patients are given larger doses, while others are unknowingly given a placebo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aimspro has undergone an open label' clinical trial, a version of this last stage, where patients know they are taking the real drug, not a placebo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it could still take ten years for it to be licensed and prescribed to patients time that desperately ill patients such as Andrew do not have. What they want is access to drugs such as aimspro before they are licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, drug companies are reluctant to allow this, even to dying sufferers, for fear of being sued if patients experience adverse effects or die as a result of taking them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aimspro is available for named patient compassionate use', meaning a doctor can prescribe the drug where no other is available, although it is still considered experimental and has to be paid for privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the doctor bears the risk of being sued, so many are reluctant to do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew was able to find a doctor who would prescribe the drug, but had to sign a disclaimer to waive his rights to sue if something went wrong. He's since spent all his savings and money raised by well-wishers a total of &pound;50,000 having the &pound;180-a-day drug injected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was able to carry on working, albeit in a more administrative role, at the fire station. I even ran the London Marathon this year,' says Andrew, speaking through Donna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the drug could only slow progression of the disease, and by summer he couldn't use his arms, meaning everyday things such as making a cup of tea were out of reach. But he still believed the drugs were helping,' says Donna who lives with Andrew and their four-year-old daughter Isla in Poole, Dorset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, his money has now run out and he's had to come off the drug and in the three months since he stopped taking it, he has gone considerably downhill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The muscles in my throat and tongue that help me speak have deteriorated,' says Andrew. My speech was slightly slurred before, but now it's worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking isn't coming naturally any more I have to concentrate on how to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were recently at a wishing well and Isla threw a coin in and wished I had new arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd love to pick Isla up and cuddle her it's what I long for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been soul-destroying knowing there's a drug out there that would help me, but I can't have it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it seems that a new law could soon make Andrew's wish a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday it was announced that a Bill which would allow terminally-ill patients to be given untested drugs had received government backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Medical Innovation Bill, which will go before the House of Lords on Friday and is due to be considered by MPs in December, would allow doctors to treat people with terminal illnesses and who have exhausted standard treatment options with drugs that are unlicensed or have not been tested for their disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill would give legal protection to doctors so long as they obtained agreement from another specialist to prescribe drugs or surgery which wouldn't normally be given for a patient's condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would apply to NHS and private doctors, meaning that funding would come down to local health authorities, now known as Clinical Commissioning Groups, as is the case with standard treatment. If passed, the Bill could become law in England and Wales by&nbsp;March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill was proposed by the Conservative peer Lord Saatchi, who has led a campaign to change the law after his wife, author Josephine Hart, died from ovarian cancer, aged 69, in 2011. He argued that current rules are impeding medical progress, forcing doctors to stick to traditional treatments which don't always work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors know if they divert from these well-worn treatment paths and attempt an innovative treatment, and then something goes wrong, they will be found guilty of medical negligence,' he has said. As he told Good Health yesterday: I want every patient who is facing a terminal diagnosis to be able to ask their doctor: &quot;Have you tried everything?&quot; And for this Bill to allow doctors to say, confidently: &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No patient should die thinking more could have been be done, but wasn't for fear of the law. No husband, wife, son, daughter, mother or father should be forced to say goodbye to a loved one with that doubt hanging over them.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Culliford says she and her husband, who have spoken previously in the Mail about the need for the law to change, support this Bill 110 per cent'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing nothing is not an option for us. Sitting here waiting for the Grim Reaper is not an option. We know aimspro works for Andrew, so that's the drug we want to try.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another patient who could benefit hugely' from the proposed legislation is six-year-old Jack Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a terminal and incurable condition that causes muscles to weaken, and he is slowly losing the ability to walk and lift things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother says there are 43 drugs in development for Jack's condition, but none has yet been approved. Jack will die from Duchenne, but he could have treatment,' adds Alex, 30, who lives with her husband Andy, 40, their two-year-old son James and Jack, near Chorley, Lancashire. This new Bill would change all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not some crazy parent. We want to discuss these untested drugs with doctors and make a decision together. We'd be willing to sign a waiver if they would just give us access to these drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a mum, I see these promising drugs dangling in front of me and we can't use them. Jack has said to me: &quot;Mummy, when are my legs going to get better?&quot; All I can do is tell him Mummy and Daddy are working hard to find new treatments.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would try these drugs on Jack. I know that might kill him. But the risk, for me, is doing nothing. My son is going to die anyway.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet some clinicians don't think the Bill is the way forward. Michael Baum, professor emeritus of surgery at University College London, said yesterday: Changing the law is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Ammar Al-Chalabi, professor of neurology and complex disease genetics at King's College London, has warned: Licensed drugs have to go through rigorous trials. Even if an unlicensed drug works in some way, it might kill you in another way or cause problems.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many patients don't accept this argument. In August the World Health Organisation said people with Ebola should be allowed untested drugs; Andrew believes the same should apply to other people facing death. I know we can't compare having MND to the Ebola outbreak, but for those of us with a terminal illness, we're facing a crisis every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd welcome being used as a guinea pig for untested drugs. It might make a difference to others and it would give me a sense of purpose, rather than just fading away.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Subject to the risk of a deterioration in Ebola control, the IMF predicted that growth would &quot;remain strong&quot;, at around 5pc in 2014 - reduced from an estimate of 5.5pc this April, as the &quot;positive picture&quot; has become &quot;overshadowed by the dire situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where Ebola is exacting a &quot;heavy human and economic toll&quot;, the IMF said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank has said Ebola could cost affected economies up to &pound;20bn, in a worst-case scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With epidemiologists estimating that it &quot;may take up to nine months to bring the outbreak under control&quot;, the IMF said that the epidemic would shave 1.5 percentage points off Guinea's growth in 2014, and 3.25-3.5 in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Beyond the human cost, the outbreak &quot;is set to have an acute impact&quot; across the three countries' key economic sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Economic spillovers&quot; have already begun to materialise in neighbouring countries, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Risks that Ebola may spread have already affected cocoa prices, and tourism in Gambia and Senegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEALTH chiefs declared Nigeria to be officially free of the deadly Ebola virus yesterday, giving rare praise to the country's government for containing an outbreak that could have proved disastrous.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an unexpected glimmer of hope in the battle against Ebola, Nigerian officials successfully tracked down and quarantined nearly 1,000 possible carriers of the virus after an initial case back in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The operation confounded fears that the giant West African nation was likely to become a major breeding ground for Ebola, given its huge cities, poor health service, and reputation for chaotic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that Nigeria had not had a confirmed case of Ebola for 42 days - equivalent to two successive incubation periods of 21 days - effectively giving it a clean bill of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcent is a relief to WHO officials, who had feared the outbreak would be uncontrollable were it to spread to Nigeria's lawless north-east, where the Boko Haram insurgent group holds sway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a spectacular success story,&quot; said Rui Gama Vaz, a WHO spokesman, to applause at a news conference in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. &quot;It shows that Ebola can be contained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unflattering comparisons are now likely to be drawn between Nigeria's success and the mishandling of the recent Ebola outbreak in America, where President Barack Obama berated health officials on Sunday for a series of mishaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Texas, some 120 people are still being monitored for possible infection, although yesterday officials said that 43 of 48 people on an original watch list had now passed a 21-day incubation period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we have seen with the terrible Ebola outbreak, Africa still has huge problems ( On the Ebola frontline, G2, 21 October ). Why doesn't each of the EU countries adopt an African nation, to make a difference by practical help, leadership, technology and encouragement? Scotland adopted Malawi a while ago. It would be interesting to see which EU countries could make the most difference to its adoptee - and all would learn from a competitive spirit and from each other. Africa need not be like it is. It has the long-term capability to be a great resource in the world economy as a supplier and as a market. It could also help relieve the problems associated with migration to the EU ( Record numbers of migrants have died in the Mediterranean, 21 October). If Africa's economies could be fully developed, perhaps its peoples would not need to risk death to escape. Frank CannonGlasgow</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Korto Williams makes a crucial point in arguing that an holistic approach is essential in dealing with Ebola ( Letters, 20 October ). Simply sending money will not work, not just because so much will be skimmed off to support the lifestyles of corrupt politicians, but because so often countries in that region do not have the capacity to implement top-down solutions. In my own experience working on HIV/Aids in Malawi, Unicef made the fundamental error of insisting on imposing a grand strategy - in a country without the framework of governance to implement it. What the country did and does have is a huge number of dedicated and capable people who would be able to cope if only they had the support they needed to do so. Simple measures such as providing health workers with bicycles to travel between villages has a vastly greater potential to help in a country without adequate public transport.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international development secretary, Justine Greening, has met British medics Will Pooley and Oliver Johnson at a Freetown clinic just hours after arriving in Sierra Leone as part of the UK's response to the Ebola crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greening described the government's three-pronged strategy to combat the disease: helping to change funeral practices identified as a leading cause of contagion; community outreach; and training of health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in addition to building five Ebola hospitals with capacity to treat 700 patients as part of the UK's &pound;125m aid package to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're helping to triple the treatment beds for people with Ebola, making sure we have safe burial teams in place so that when people do die we can with dignity nevertheless help to make sure they get buried without infecting more people which is one of the main reasons the disease has spread,&quot; she told the BBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also then working in communities to try and treat people as early as possible before they become more infectious... and then finally doing training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greening is the first British government representative to visit Sierra Leone since Ebola outbreak began in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a visit to UK-funded Kings Health Ebola care unit in the capital, Freetown, she met Pooley, the nurse who has just returned to Sierra Leone after a full recovery from the virus, and his new boss, Johnson, a doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking before she set off for Sierra Leone on Tuesday with about 100 RAF medics and logisticians being sent to build a training academy and field hospital, Greening said: &quot;If we don't combat Ebola it will take many more lives, but also it can pose a risk to the UK&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is also to visit the British-funded Kerry Town Ebola hospital just outside Freetown which is scheduled to open its 92-bed facility next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will initially be run by military personnel and Cuban medics but will then be taken over by Save the Children and staffed by NHS volunteers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cam'ron is vowing to protect fans from Ebola with his newest piece of merchandise: a surgical mask. Although the virus cannot be spread through the air, the Dipset rapper claims the official Cam'ron Ebola Mask will &quot;provide complete protection&quot; from the deadly disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wrap it up and protect yourself from Ebola just like Killa Cam!&quot; reads the copy in Dipset's official online shop (via Vulture ). The conventional polypropylene/cellulose face-mask boasts an unconventional image on its front: Cam'ron reclining in luxe, pink comfort. There's also a full-width nosepiece, to &quot;guarantee proper fit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola is no joking matter,&quot; Cam'ron tweeted. &quot;So if u have to be safe. Be fashionable.&quot; But prospective purchasers should be advised: even the most hip-hop surgical mask does not change the fact that Ebola travels via body fluids such as blood. Still, Cam'ron's new merchandise was able to appeal to some buyers: &quot;Buying 100 @Mr_Camron ebola masks just in case this shit spreads to canada,&quot; one fan wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cam'ron's concern does not extend across the music scene. The rapper TI arrived in Ethiopia on 18 October, en route to a concert in Tanzania. Although he posted photographs of his visit to an Ebola checking centre, he has mostly ignored the epidemic (there have been no reported Ebola cases in Tanzania or Ethiopia, after all). Instead, TI has written about the beauty of the land and the &quot;ultradope&quot;, &quot;megaturnt&quot; gig, encouraging others to visit the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, deaths from Ebola have exceeded 4,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; This article was amended on 21 October 2014 to amend a figure for deaths from Ebola. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention gives the figure as at least 4,555.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is terrible. But three cases do not a national crisis make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An election, however, is always a crisis. And the first rule of a political crisis is to look like you're doing something .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks out from a US midterm election, Republicans and Democrats have both worked to make a political catastrophe for their opponents out of the western media's hysteria in response to Ebola - which health experts believe could reach 10,000 new cases a week by December... in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox example, take Republican congressman Tom Price of George - a physician representing us here in suburban Atlanta, minutes from the Centers for Disease Control - who criticized the Obama administration right after it named Ron Klain the new &quot;Ebola czar&quot; to coordinate the national response: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than putting another person in charge, President Obama needs to task every agency already involved in this crisis - those with real medical expertise and crisis management - with reviewing existing policies and protocols to determine what's effective, what's ineffective and what more should be done to stop the expansion of the Ebola outbreak abroad and protect Americans here at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except that putting another person in charge is exactly what Republicans demanded in the days leading up to Klain's appointment. Senator John McCain called for a coordinating czar last week, as did several other Republicans - including Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moran's call for a czar came despite a long record of opposing Obama administration czars as a symbol of federal overreach and wasteful spending. No matter. It's a crisis. An election is upon us, and Ebola is on television. Do something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Moran responded to the appointment by describing Klain as a mere political operative with a title undeserving of the post he demanded the administration create:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a real crisis and worthy of an individual with extensive background in international diplomacy, experience coordinating large-scale interagency missions, as well as a proven ability to work with Congress and across the aisle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klain isn't a doctor. He's a lawyer. He's not there to tell physicians how to scrub - he's there to be invited to hearings he doesn't want to go to and yelled at by guys like McCain and Moran and eventually blamed for whatever goes wrong. I can think of no better fate for a Washington attorney. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need to do something - anything - about Ebolaalso turned political orthodoxy on its head, with partisan charges and countercharges about how poorly the CDC has been funded and by whom. Rep Jack Kingston (R-GA), who had been running for the US senate this year on a platform of reducing government, took to local television to assert that &quot;whatever they're asking for, we in Congress are giving it to them, just recently $30m to the CDC, $58m to [the Biological Advanced Research and Development Agency] to try to develop vaccines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where was that money last year - or any of the years before? Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told the Huffington Post last week that the NIH had been working on Ebola vaccines since 2001. &quot;Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would've gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spending on Ebola vaccine research fell from $37m in 2010 to $18m in 2014 - forcing the NIH to shelve a quarter of its grants on Ebola research, according to the Washington Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have been quick to note that the Obama administration's budget for 2013 and 2014 cut spending for the CDC, but that Congress boosted it above the budget request - calling foul on Democratic campaign ads highlighting reduced expenditures. They have been less eager to note that spending has fallen in both nominal and real dollars for most of the last decade, largely as a function of general budgetary intransigence instigated by Republicans. (That's the sort of thing that led to the fiscal cliff and the grand compromise of the sequester, which cut federal budgets by 10 percent across the board.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not coming to kill you - though the nonstop speculative hysteria about it on television might sting. The tragedy today is how it takes the perception of a crisis for policymakers to treat public health like a serious issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parents of the British nurse who survived Ebola have backed his decision to return to Sierra Leone and revealed that their son felt he was destined to care for the sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his second stint in the disease-hit country, Will Pooley, told the Guardian that he could not stand &quot;idly by&quot; and watch more die, despite the concerns of his friends and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now his parents, Robin and Jackie Pooley, have spoken of their pride at their son's bravery in the facing the risk of catching the disease again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'We knew from the start that he would go back. We were sort of counting down the days&nbsp;... knowing him we were quite aware that he hadn't finished with his task in Sierra Leone,&quot; Pooley's mother, Jackie, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she did not try to dissuade her son from returning to Africa. &quot;You bring up your children to be independent, you want them to live happy and fulfilled lives&nbsp;... Looking at the pictures of him when he was working out there he looked happy - he looked as if he was doing what he really wanted to be doing. You can't put a spanner in the works when your children have found something that really fulfils them...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very few people find that sort of fulfilment in their work. We can only support him and we do 100%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley's father added: &quot;When I spoke to him about looking happy, he said: 'Dad, I felt it was what I was made for this'. And he's lucky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Suffolk nurse has been told that he may have immunity from the disease, but there is no scientific evidence for this. In his interview for the Guardian he said he would take the same kind of stringent precautions as the other health workers treating victims of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley has begun working at an isolation unit at a hospital in the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, after arriving in the country on Sunday. Before he left Pooley said his potential immunity should help allay the concerns of his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I know my mum and dad are worried but they support me because they know this is something I have to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My potential immunity is very reassuring for them, or at least it should be, and I will be returning in a more organised fashion than when I was out there originally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley's father, Robin, said it was impossible to know whether his son could catch Ebola for a second time. &quot;Nobody is clear because the experience of the disease is so limited,&quot; he told the BBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They think he has some immunity, but there's no certainty. Anyway he has got to pretend he could catch it again in order to show best practice to the people he will be training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pooleys said that Britain and the international community was failing to do enough to stop the spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robin Pooley said: &quot;I know Britain is doing more than a lot of countries, but the west has got to step up to this, and what's being done already is inadequate&nbsp;... the disease is doubling every four weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Pooley contracted the disease in Sierra Leone in August he was flown back to the UK and treated in a special isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in London. He recovered after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp, and has since donated some of his blood in case it offers clues about how to treat the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps compulsively buying Ebola products is itself a disease? If so, an epidemic of that too is brewing. Some people think the virus is all part of a conspiracy that must be exposed. Others believe it is the dawn of an apocalypse and are planning their survival. Then there are the people who just need to laugh in the face of so much sombre news (thankfully, we don't see many of the faces of the people dying). Where there is this kind of demand, there will be supply. Here's a selection of what's on offer:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Halloween costume: Alarm your friends by arriving at their Halloween party dressed as a health worker risking their life to save others. Accessorise with a spray canister full of green vodka, if you can find one. NB: Suit offers no actual protection from Ebola. NBB: Suit doesn't need to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Books: Still not read enough about Ebola? From scientific histories to survivalist handbooks and crackpot fantasies, everything that could possibly be written about the disease already has been, at some length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Virus doll: Children have fluffy toy lions and tigers, so why not deadly viruses? &quot;The T rex of microbes,&quot; says the seller's website and, less plausibly, &quot;great teaching tool&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Tie: Finally there is an ethical way to dress unpleasantly for work while at the same time taking a lighthearted look at people being dangerously ill. An unspecified &quot;portion of proceeds&quot; goes to &quot;important non-profit public health agencies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Bumper stickers: You can like Barack Obama or dislike Barack Obama. But can you really blame him for the evolution of a virus first identified thousands of miles away when he was 15? Hell, yeah!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     iPhone case: I imagine the Chinese factory worker who makes these asking his line manager what they are and being told: &quot;Oh it's just the logo of an American sitcom from the 1990s redesigned with the name of a deadly virus and then printed on the back of a range of iPhone cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                       Ebola thong:                      I have tried to imagine the right time and place to reveal to somebody that you are wearing an Ebola thong, and I have failed. Maybe it's all about how it makes you feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Prayer candle: Once again, &quot;a portion&quot; of the proceeds from this item goes towards Ebola relief. And yet it's hard not to feel that the purchaser could do even more good by maybe, just this once, not buying mystical prayer equipment and instead sending all the money to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Apps: The Ebola news aggregator looks harmless, if a little obsessive. The About Ebola app - in Krio, Jola, Liberian English and other African languages - looks downright useful. Yet it is Plague Virus Outbreak with its &quot;80 levels of virus-busting puzzle arcade action&quot; that gets the rave reviews. &quot;Highly infectious&quot;, boasts its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Shopping trolley handle cover: Some say this is merely a conventional CartCuff with the word &quot;Ebola&quot; added to the listing. Others say that if you reach the point where you are spending $5 in order not to catch Ebola from a shopping trolley, you are ill already.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wrap it up and protect yourself from Ebola just like Killa Cam!&quot; reads the copy in Dipset's official online shop (via Vulture ).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ebola is no joking matter,&quot; Cam'ron tweeted. &quot;So if u have to be safe. Be fashionable.&quot; But prospective purchasers should be advised: even the most hip-hop surgical mask does not change the fact that Ebola travels via body fluids such as blood. Still, Cam'ron's new merchandise was able to appeal to some buyers: &quot;Buying 100 @Mr_Camron ebola masks just in case this shit spreads to canada,&quot; one fan wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cam'ron's concern does not extend across the music scene. The rapper TI arrived in Ethiopia on 18 October, en route to a concert in Tanzania. Although he posted photographs of his visit to an Ebola checking centre, he has mostly ignored the epidemic (there have been no reported Ebola cases in Tanzania or Ethiopia, after all).

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola crisis hasn't really taken off in the UK as a medical phenomenon. But the fear of the crisis seems to be progressing quite nicely. Black Africans are regarded warily on planes, on buses and in schools. Lots of opportunity to say the unsayable. I heard one phone-in caller at the weekend complain that every time he wandered onto Bradford's free city bus - much patronised by students - and &quot;rubbed up against&quot; the black African student passengers, his anxiety levels rose perceptively. You might try not rubbing up against them, advised the presenter. This didn't seem to have occurred to him. Nor did the possibility that if he stayed away from the free bus, he might - at reasonable cost - give the black African students a wide berth, lower his own anxiety levels and free up space for less jittery commuters. The authorities have yet to detail the risks from actively rubbing up against fellow commuters in the rush hour. High time they did.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Old McDonald had a charm</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole Ebola operation has been lacking really. No one listens to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Where is the medical leader who can turn on the charm, look us in the eye and give it to us straight? Some of us recall the Falklands War when the news - good and bad - was imparted to a pensive nation by Ian McDonald, a dour career civil servant from the Ministry of Defence. He was described by the author Julian Barnes as having &quot;the delivery and charisma of a speak-your-weight machine &quot;. In matters of life and death, this grave approach worked well: triumph and tragedy, both conveyed in monotone, so that without a transcript you couldn't tell the difference.

Some journos have had the nerve to criticise health staff in Spain, where a nurse apparently caught Ebola because of lax procedures. Criticism also of the protective shortcomings in Texas, where staff also caught the virus. Reading this, I was reminded of the comedy that ensued when I and fellow hacks tried to perfect the technique for donning our expensively purchased chemical protection suits during the first Gulf War, that inaugural US outing for the coalition of the willing. We had five minutes to don the clothing, just nine seconds to render the face mask airtight.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer than three people a month infected with the Ebola virus are likely to try to board planes out of west Africa, according to a study that says exit screening would be the most efficient way to try to prevent travellers spreading disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK and US have set up entry screening at airports for passengers arriving from west Africa, but the paper in the Lancet medical journal says this will have little chance of detecting somebody infected with the virus and that it will cost money that could be better spent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper is written by Dr Kamran Khan at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada, and colleagues. The team analysed worldwide flight schedules from 2014, taking account of the routes that have been suspended because of the crisis, and flight itineraries from 2013 to establish the population's normal travel patterns. They used World Health Organisation data on Ebola virus infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors say that restricting air travel from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the epidemic is raging, is damaging to the countries' economies and may potentially handicap efforts to end the Ebola outbreak, which is the best way to safeguard the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They found that most travellers from the three countries - more than 60% - fly to low- and middle-income countries, with Ghana and Senegal as the top destinations. The arrival of somebody infected with Ebola is a greater threat to less affluent countries than to the UK, which was the third most popular destination, with 8.7% of travellers, or to the USA, where 2% would be headed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given that these countries have limited medical and public health resources, they may have difficulty quickly identifying and effectively responding to imported Ebola cases,&quot; said Khan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The risk of international spread could increase significantly if the outbreak in west Africa persists and grows. Risks to the global community would further increase if Ebola virus were to spread to and within other countries with weak public health systems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screening passengers either at exit or entry will miss cases, the paper says, because of the long incubation period of the virus - up to 21 days. Because many direct flights to countries like the UK have been stopped, travellers anyway have to change planes or use additional forms of transport and may not be identified as coming from west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exit screening in the capital cities of Conakry, Freetown and Monrovia &quot;would offer greater efficiency, and might be simpler to operationalise, than entry screening all flights arriving directly from affected countries,&quot; says the paper. But it needs support from the international community, because the west African states are in the middle of an emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of attention has been focused on ways in which affluent countries can protect their populations, Khan told the Guardian, including travel bans. But, he said, &quot;the most proactive way is to decrease the many new infections in the source region itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a ban might make people far from west Africa feel more secure, he said: &quot;Our analysis suggests the opposite. Decreasing the number of infections in the source area is the most important way to decrease the spread.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other experts commented, however, that political considerations will often trump scientific analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this research fails to consider,&quot; said Dr Adam Kamradt-Scott, senior lecturer in international security studies, at the University of Sydney, &quot;is that in public health crises like Ebola the political pressure on leaders to be seen to be doing everything they can to protect their citizens is immense. We can have the best available evidence, but it won't amount to a hill of beans if we don't also understand the politics behind these events.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron has crossed the Rubicon. There is no going back. By proposing to limit free movement of labour from the EU he has planted himself on the side of the outs, as Jose Manuel Barroso made crystal clear in his Chatham House speech yesterday. The other 27 nations will never agree: if limiting national insurance numbers for EU workers is Cameron's new red line then he has joined the Ukip wing of his party, who won't let him renege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer . . . when it comes to free movement,&quot; he told his conference, and now that's confirmed. In a riposte to Barroso's plain statement of the facts on EU law, No 10 rudely warned him that he &quot;should be under no illusion that the status quo is not acceptable to the UK&quot;. Cameron went one worse and told him &quot;who is the boss&quot; on immigration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no effective difference between Ukip and the Conservatives, both heading for the exit - except, as Nigel Farage says, Cameron &quot;is deceiving the British public&quot; with nonexistent options, breeding more political cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron is no Caesar. He has been dragged backwards across this Rubicon by his enemies, in the long lurch away from Europe that began when he used an anti-EU ploy to secure the Tory leadership. Leadership? Not really, he's been trailing after the Europhobes ever since, trying to keep up. Every step since then he has conceded British interests to appease the unappeasables. He won with a promise to withdraw the Tories from the European People's party, outraging natural conservative allies such as Angela Merkel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That bartering of British influence was the telling moment: Cameron would put his political interest ahead of his country's in ways that would surely shock previous Tory prime ministers. Would any of them deliberately risk the nation's pivotal international relationship just to swing an embarrassing byelection in Rochester? Cameron's stated view is that Britain is better off inside the EU - but not, it seems, if it puts him to much inconvenience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now Cameron has wisely refused to spell out negotiating terms for reforms he would seek before a 2017 referendum. He might have held to that if he made the broad case for Europe, rebutting his backbenchers. But as his anti-EU rhetoric heated up, the Europhobes demanded red lines so blood-red they would be impossible to achieve, guaranteeing British exit. By definition, nothing Cameron suggested that might be agreeable to the other EU 27 would be enough for his outists or for Ukip. Only impossible demands would be enough - a bizarrely Trotskyist revolutionary tactic from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and John Redwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the trap his enemies have cleverly pushed him into. It wasn't hard, as they saw he never had the nerve or conviction to stand and fight. They saw that character flaw, and he's despised for it on all sides of his party. His strategy against Ukip has been a disaster: first he ignored them, then he insulted them, now he imitates them. He never tried making a robust EU case against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barroso, safe in the last days of his term, laid bare his contempt for the Cameron government's Euro-madness, spelling out the consequences of British withdrawal: banks and businesses have told him they would leave, along with car manufacturers and financial services. The business secretary, Vince Cable, hastened to give the same warning, as he visited a Ford factory making the sort of new investment that would stop. Out of the EU could mean Scotland departing, losing the UK's UN seat and US indifference to us as an island of irrelevance. In exchange for what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barroso's warning is a reminder of how decadent Conservative anti-EU obsession looks to the rest of the world. The eurozone, our biggest trading partner, teeters on the verge of another nervous breakdown. British households still struggle with falling incomes. Russia is flexing its muscles alarmingly on EU borders. Ebola in west Africa needs urgent assistance. Global warming gallops on, hardly checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Ebola of the brain has seized the ruling party as Cameron now &quot;bangs on&quot; about Europe. The May election is set to be an in/out decision in itself: if Cameron were to win it looks less likely he would take the pro-in side in a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour has been nervously muted on the EU and reluctant to take on Ukip. But at last they realise there is no option but a vigorous fightback. Ed Miliband's mocked conference speech was strong on Europe, calling Cameron's &quot;pandering&quot; to Ukip the reason why he's not fit to be prime minister. &quot;Let me say it plainly: our future lies inside not outside the European Union.&quot; Reforms are needed but &quot;do we reform Europe by building alliances or by burning alliances?&quot;. Cameron has no chance of negotiating with &quot;one hand on the exit door&quot;. &quot;The biggest threat to our prosperity is now the Conservative party.&quot; Arguing for staying in, even if it's unpopular, is Labour's best proof of economic responsibility, as the Tories swivel off the eurorails. Many Labour MPs were heartened when Miliband told the parliamentary Labour party last week that he would now tackle Ukip head on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration rides near the top in public concerns - and it frightens all parties. Labour can promise reforms on benefits for migrants and on new accession states - but that won't satisfy the Ukip-minded. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, fresh from the Scottish referendum, says the winning message must be the same: promise achievable reform from the safety of staying within the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a pro-EU party, Labour can take the credit for honesty - unlike Cameron. Admit life is full of difficult trade-offs: leaving the EU would harm the country far more than taking in migrants who are young and productive. But they could say that money brought in by migration - worth several billion a year - should be pledged for those communities who most need new homes and schools, the poorest whose anger has been turned against newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course that won't assuage the rage of Faragists who hate foreign languages spoken on trains. But it may be grudgingly accepted as common sense by most. After all, with few making the pro-EU case loudly enough, polls still find more people wanting to stay in. Time for Labour to bang the drum louder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the Nigerian government released the 2014 National Honours award list: more than 300 people, many of them serving government officials, seemingly recognised simply because of the public office they hold, not for anything particularly honourable or heroic. An outcry followed, largely due to the absence of one name: Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh. A government spokesman was forced to explain that the awards are never given posthumously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public's indignation was understandable: Adadevoh was the Nigerian doctor who oversaw the treatment of Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian national who brought the Ebola virus to Nigeria. She died of the virus on 19 August, one of eight fatalities out of 20 cases (each linked to Sawyer) in the country. Without her dedication, it is quite possible that the World Health Organisation would not have declared Nigeria - the most populous country in Africa - Ebola-free on Monday. The significance of her actions, and those of her colleagues, cannot be overstated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an account by Ada Igonoh, a young doctor who treated Sawyer - and upon whom it fell to certify him dead - Adadevoh turned down a request by Sawyer's employers to have him discharged so he could catch a flight to Calabar, a coastal city 750km from Lagos, where he had been due to attend a conference (we are left to imagine what would have followed had Sawyer been allowed to leave Lagos for Calabar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Igonoh says that from the moment Adadevoh suspected Sawyer might have Ebola - the Liberian had denied contact with an Ebola patient, even though his sister had died of the virus barely two weeks before his arrival in Nigeria - she quarantined him, made contact with the authorities, and ensured the provision of protective materials and Ebola educational material to hospital staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adadevoh was born in Lagos in October 1956. Her father was Babatunde Adadevoh, a professor of chemical pathology and, between 1978 and 1980, the vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos. Her great-grandfather was the Nigerian nationalist Herbert Macaulay (himself the grandson of Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the first African Anglican bishop). She lived most of her life in Lagos, spending the last 21 years working at the First Cons-ultant hospital on Lagos Island, where a statue of Macaulay still stands today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a fine tribute, Nigerian journalist Simon Kolawole explained that Adadevoh was only doing her job as a medical professional. He wrote: &quot;There were various options in front of her when she discovered Sawyer had Ebola: one, quietly say 'e no concern me' and discharge him quickly to avoid contaminating the hospital; two, refer him to (Lagos University Teaching hospital), not minding the bigger consequences for the rest of Nigeria; three, act responsibly in line with the ethics of the medical profession and 'detain' him because of the peculiarity of the disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That this needed to be pointed out at all is perhaps testimony to how unused Nigeria has become to the idea of people doing their jobs as they should. It is precisely the reason Adadevoh needs to be honoured: as a reminder that heroism can be attained as much in everyday work clothes as it can in superhero capes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, the Lagos state parliament asked Governor Babatunde Fashola to rename the Infectious Diseases hospital in Lagos - where Adadevoh died - in her memory. There is still time to further recognise Adadevoh's heroism. No doubt the biggest tribute Nigeria could ever give her would be to create a culture in which devotion and dedication to one's vocation is habitual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps compulsively buying Ebola products is itself a disease? If so, an epidemic of that too is brewing. Some people think the virus is all part of a conspiracy that must be exposed. Others believe it is the dawn of an apocalypse and are planning their survival. Then there are the people who just need to laugh in the face of so much sombre news (thankfully, we don't see many of the faces of the people dying). Where there is this kind of demand, there will be supply. Here's a selection of what's on offer:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halloween costume: Alarm your friends by arriving at their Halloween party dressed as a health worker risking their life to save others. Accessorise with a spray canister full of green vodka, if you can find one. NB: Suit offers no actual protection from Ebola. NBB: Suit doesn't need to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Books: Still not read enough about Ebola? From scientific histories to survivalist handbooks and crackpot fantasies, everything that could possibly be written about the disease already has been, at some length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola thong: I have tried to imagine the right time and place to reveal to somebody that you are wearing an Ebola thong, and I have failed. Maybe it's all about how it makes you feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virus doll: Children have fluffy toy lions and tigers, so why not deadly viruses? &quot;The T rex of microbes,&quot; says the seller's website and, less plausibly, &quot;great teaching tool&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tie: Finally there is an ethical way to dress unpleasantly for work while at the same time taking a lighthearted look at people being dangerously ill. An unspecified &quot;portion of proceeds&quot; goes to &quot;important non-profit public health agencies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bumper stickers: You can like Barack Obama or dislike Barack Obama. But can you really blame him for the evolution of a virus first identified thousands of miles away when he was 15? Hell, yeah!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iPhone case: I imagine the Chinese factory worker who makes these asking his line manager what they are and being told: &quot;Oh it's just the logo of an American sitcom from the 1990s redesigned with the name of a deadly virus and then printed on the back of a range of iPhone cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prayer candle: Once again, &quot;a portion&quot; of the proceeds from this item goes towards Ebola relief. And yet it's hard not to feel that the purchaser could do even more good by maybe, just this once, not buying mystical prayer equipment and instead sending all the money to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apps: The Ebola news aggregator looks harmless, if a little obsessive. The About Ebola app - in Krio, Jola, Liberian English and other African languages - looks downright useful. Yet it is Plague Virus Outbreak with its &quot;80 levels of virus-busting puzzle arcade action&quot; that gets the rave reviews. &quot;Highly infectious&quot;, boasts its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shopping trolley handle cover: Some say this is merely a conventional CartCuff with the word &quot;Ebola&quot; added to the listing. Others say that if you reach the point where you are spending $5 in order not to catch Ebola from a shopping trolley, you are ill already.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screening for passengers arriving at airports in the UK and US will have little chance of detecting someone infected with the virus and will cost money that could be better spent, a paper in the Lancet medical journal warns today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings come as Gatwick airport announced it will begin screening passengers arriving from countries at risk of Ebola, following Heathrow airport, which began screening last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors say that restricting air travel from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the epidemic is raging, is damaging to the countries' economies and may potentially handicap efforts to end the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper is written by Dr Kamran Khan of St Michael's hospital in Toronto, and colleagues. The team, which calculated that fewer than three people a month infected with Ebola are likely to try to board planes out of west Africa, argue that exit screening in the capital cities of Conakry, Freetown and Monrovia &quot;would offer greater efficiency, and might be simpler to operationalise, than entry screening all flights arriving directly from affected countries&quot;. But such a move needs support from the international community. A lot of attention has been focused on ways in which affluent countries can protect their populations, Khan told the Guardian. But, he said, &quot;the most proactive way is to decrease the many new infections in the source region itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His argument was reinforced yesterday when Nigeria was declared Ebola-free in what the World Health Organisation's director for Nigeria, Rui Gama Vaz, described as a &quot;spectacular success story&quot;. The way they beat the virus could serve as a model for the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak began in Nigeria when a Liberian man, Patrick Sawyer flew to Lagos on 20 July against medical advice. He was visibly ill when he boarded the plane and collapsed at the airport, but was treated for malaria because he denied he had been in contact with Ebola. It took three days, during which time nine medical staff nursing him became infected, four of whom later died, before Ebola was diagnosed and he was placed in isolation. He died two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the virus was confirmed, a massive public health effort began. Every person who may have been exposed to the virus had to be found and isolated if they developed symptoms. Even though that involved hunting through crowded buildings in streets without door numbers, Nigerian teams managed to trace everyone who had been in contact with Sawyer and everyone who had contact with those who later developed the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total, 19 people became ill in Nigeria, seven of whom died. It could have been much worse in Nigeria's densely populated cities - there are 21 million people in Lagos. But Nigeria set up an emergency operations centre, staffed with many experts who work on polio eradication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a paper written by some of those involved, in the journal Eurosurveillance, the list of contacts reached 898, and they were not all in Lagos. A nurse who became infected travelled more than 310 miles to Enugu, finding at least 21 contacts. But the biggest crisis was caused by one of Sawyer's contacts, who had been infected, fleeing to Port Harcourt, where he infected a doctor. That doctor, who died, was linked to 526 contacts, including many members of his church who carried out a healing ceremony for him involving the laying on of hands. In total, the contact tracers made 18,500 face-to-face visits. Their persistence paid off.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My inbox fills with invitations relating to Black History Month. Usually this means two things. Renewed hostilities from those who deify Florence Nightingale and can't stand to hear anyone, even momentarily, discussing the qualities of Mary Seacole. They were pretty cross when plans were laid for a statue of Seacole in London. Recently the Nightingale lobby took lumps out of the BBC for suggesting in a children's programme that Flo could have been a tad racist. The Flo-ites have their equivalent of New Labour's rapid rebuttal unit. The other hardy perennial is that someone will say why do we have a Black History Month? When are we going to have a White History Month?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A variant of this was directed at the BBC a few years back when it aired a series featuring stories and issues relevant to those of African and Caribbean origin and called it Black Britain. An angry viewer rang the production office. &quot;When are we going to have a current affairs programme about white Britain,&quot; he demanded. The producer, himself indigenous, was lying in wait. &quot;We already have,&quot; he said. &quot;We call it the Nine O'Clock News.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubbing up the wrong way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola crisis hasn't really taken off in the UK as a medical phenomenon. But the fear of the crisis seems to be progressing quite nicely. Black Africans are regarded warily on planes, on buses and in schools. Lots of opportunity to say the unsayable. I heard one phone-in caller at the weekend complain that every time he wandered onto Bradford's free city bus - much patronised by students - and &quot;rubbed up against&quot; the black African student passengers, his anxiety levels rose perceptively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might try not rubbing up against them, advised the presenter. This didn't seem to have occurred to him. Nor did the possibility that if he stayed away from the free bus, he might - at reasonable cost - give the black African students a wide berth, lower his own anxiety levels and free up space for less jittery commuters. The authorities have yet to detail the risks from actively rubbing up against fellow commuters in the rush hour. High time they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Old McDonald had a charm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole Ebola operation has been lacking something. No one listens to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Where is the medical leader who can turn on the charm, look us in the eye and give it to us straight? Some of us recall the Falklands War when the news - good and bad - was imparted to a pensive nation by Ian McDonald , a dour career civil servant from the Ministry of Defence. He was described by the author Julian Barnes as having &quot;the delivery and charisma of a speak-your-weight machine&quot;. In matters of life and death, this grave approach worked well: triumph and tragedy, both conveyed in monotone, so that without a transcript you couldn't tell the difference. McDonald was the template. If anyone could have stopped the frottage on the free bus, it's him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stink over the Gulf War</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You certainly can't rely on the media for calm communication. Some journos have had the nerve to criticise health staff in Spain, where a nurse apparently caught Ebola because of lax procedures. Criticism also of the protective shortcomings in Texas, where staff also caught the virus. Reading this, I was reminded of the comedy that ensued when I and fellow hacks tried to perfect the technique for donning our expensively purchased chemical protection suits during the first Gulf War, that inaugural US outing for the coalition of the willing. We had five minutes to don the clothing, just nine seconds to render the face mask airtight. Had Saddam lobbed even a stink bomb across the border, pretty much the entire British press corps would have been wiped out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron has crossed the Rubicon. There is no going back. By proposing to limit free movement of labour from the EU he has planted himself on the side of the outs, as Jose Manuel Barroso made crystal clear in his Chatham House speech yesterday. The other 27 nations will never agree: if limiting national insurance numbers for EU workers is Cameron's new red line then he has joined the Ukip wing of his party, who won't let him renege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer . . . when it comes to free movement,&quot; he told his conference, and now that's confirmed. In a riposte to Barroso's plain statement of the facts on EU law, No 10 rudely warned him that he &quot;should be under no illusion that the status quo is not acceptable to the UK&quot;. Cameron went one worse and told him &quot;who is the boss&quot; on immigration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no effective difference between Ukip and the Conservatives, both heading for the exit - except, as Nigel Farage says, Cameron &quot;is deceiving the British public&quot; with nonexistent options, breeding more political cynicism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron is no Caesar. He has been dragged backwards across this Rubicon by his enemies, in the long lurch away from Europe that began when he used an anti-EU ploy to secure the Tory leadership. Leadership? Not really, he's been trailing after the Europhobes ever since, trying to keep up. Every step since then he has conceded British interests to appease the unappeasables. He won with a promise to withdraw the Tories from the European People's party, outraging natural conservative allies such as Angela Merkel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That bartering of British influence was the telling moment: Cameron would put his political interest ahead of his country's in ways that would surely shock previous Tory prime ministers. Would any of them deliberately risk the nation's pivotal international relationship just to swing an embarrassing byelection in Rochester? Cameron's stated view is that Britain is better off inside the EU - but not, it seems, if it puts him to much inconvenience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now Cameron has wisely refused to spell out negotiating terms for reforms he would seek before a 2017 referendum. He might have held to that if he made the broad case for Europe, rebutting his backbenchers. But as his anti-EU rhetoric heated up, the Europhobes demanded red lines so blood-red they would be impossible to achieve, guaranteeing British exit. By definition, nothing Cameron suggested that might be agreeable to the other EU 27 would be enough for his outists or for Ukip. Only impossible demands would be enough - a bizarrely Trotskyist revolutionary tactic from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and John Redwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the trap his enemies have cleverly pushed him into. It wasn't hard, as they saw he never had the nerve or conviction to stand and fight. They saw that character flaw, and he's despised for it on all sides of his party. His strategy against Ukip has been a disaster: first he ignored them, then he insulted them, now he imitates them. He never tried making a robust EU case against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barroso, safe in the last days of his term, laid bare his contempt for the Cameron government's Euro-madness, spelling out the consequences of British withdrawal: banks and businesses have told him they would leave, along with car manufacturers and financial services. The business secretary, Vince Cable, hastened to give the same warning, as he visited a Ford factory making the sort of new investment that would stop. Out of the EU could mean Scotland departing, losing the UK's UN seat and US indifference to us as an island of irrelevance. In exchange for what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barroso's warning is a reminder of how decadent Conservative anti-EU obsession looks to the rest of the world. The eurozone, our biggest trading partner, teeters on the verge of another nervous breakdown. British households still struggle with falling incomes. Russia is flexing its muscles alarmingly on EU borders. Ebola in west Africa needs urgent assistance. Global warming gallops on, hardly checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Ebola of the brain has seized the ruling party as Cameron now &quot;bangs on&quot; about Europe. The May election is set to be an in/out decision in itself: if Cameron were to win it looks less likely he would take the pro-in side in a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour has been nervously muted on the EU and reluctant to take on Ukip. But at last they realise there is no option but a vigorous fightback. Ed Miliband's mocked conference speech was strong on Europe, calling Cameron's &quot;pandering&quot; to Ukip the reason why he's not fit to be prime minister. &quot;Let me say it plainly: our future lies inside not outside the European Union.&quot; Reforms are needed but &quot;do we reform Europe by building alliances or by burning alliances?&quot;. Cameron has no chance of negotiating with &quot;one hand on the exit door&quot;. &quot;The biggest threat to our prosperity is now the Conservative party.&quot; Arguing for staying in, even if it's unpopular, is Labour's best proof of economic responsibility, as the Tories swivel off the eurorails. Many Labour MPs were heartened when Miliband told the parliamentary Labour party last week that he would now tackle Ukip head on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration rides near the top in public concerns - and it frightens all parties. Labour can promise reforms on benefits for migrants and on new accession states - but that won't satisfy the Ukip-minded. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, fresh from the Scottish referendum, says the winning message must be the same: promise achievable reform from the safety of staying within the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a pro-EU party, Labour can take the credit for honesty - unlike Cameron. Admit life is full of difficult trade-offs: leaving the EU would harm the country far more than taking in migrants who are young and productive. But they could say that money brought in by migration - worth several billion a year - should be pledged for those communities who most need new homes and schools, the poorest whose anger has been turned against newcomers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course that won't assuage the rage of Faragists who hate foreign languages spoken on trains. But it may be grudgingly accepted as common sense by most. After all, with few making the pro-EU case loudly enough, polls still find more people wanting to stay in. Time for Labour to bang the drum louder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the Nigerian government released the 2014 National Honours award list: more than 300 people, many of them serving government officials, seemingly recognised simply because of the public office they hold, not for anything particularly honourable or heroic. An outcry followed, largely due to the absence of one name: Dr Stella Ameyo Adadevoh. A government spokesman was forced to explain that the awards are never given posthumously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public's indignation was understandable: Adadevoh was the Nigerian doctor who oversaw the treatment of Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian national who brought the Ebola virus to Nigeria. She died of the virus on 19 August, one of eight fatalities out of 20 cases (each linked to Sawyer) in the country. Without her dedication, it is quite possible that the World Health Organisation would not have declared Nigeria - the most populous country in Africa - Ebola-free on Monday. The significance of her actions, and those of her colleagues, cannot be overstated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an account by Ada Igonoh, a young doctor who treated Sawyer - and upon whom it fell to certify him dead - Adadevoh turned down a request by Sawyer's employers to have him discharged so he could catch a flight to Calabar, a coastal city 750km from Lagos, where he had been due to attend a conference (we are left to imagine what would have followed had Sawyer been allowed to leave Lagos for Calabar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Igonoh says that from the moment Adadevoh suspected Sawyer might have Ebola - the Liberian had denied contact with an Ebola patient, even though his sister had died of the virus barely two weeks before his arrival in Nigeria - she quarantined him, made contact with the authorities, and ensured the provision of protective materials and Ebola educational material to hospital staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adadevoh was born in Lagos in October 1956. Her father was Babatunde Adadevoh, a professor of chemical pathology and, between 1978 and 1980, the vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos. Her great-grandfather was the Nigerian nationalist Herbert Macaulay (himself the grandson of Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the first African Anglican bishop). She lived most of her life in Lagos, spending the last 21 years working at the First Cons-ultant hospital on Lagos Island, where a statue of Macaulay still stands today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a fine tribute, Nigerian journalist Simon Kolawole explained that Adadevoh was only doing her job as a medical professional. He wrote: &quot;There were various options in front of her when she discovered Sawyer had Ebola: one, quietly say 'e no concern me' and discharge him quickly to avoid contaminating the hospital; two, refer him to (Lagos University Teaching hospital), not minding the bigger consequences for the rest of Nigeria; three, act responsibly in line with the ethics of the medical profession and 'detain' him because of the peculiarity of the disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That this needed to be pointed out at all is perhaps testimony to how unused Nigeria has become to the idea of people doing their jobs as they should. It is precisely the reason Adadevoh needs to be honoured: as a reminder that heroism can be attained as much in everyday work clothes as it can in superhero capes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, the Lagos state parliament asked Governor Babatunde Fashola to rename the Infectious Diseases hospital in Lagos - where Adadevoh died - in her memory. There is still time to further recognise Adadevoh's heroism. No doubt the biggest tribute Nigeria could ever give her would be to create a culture in which devotion and dedication to one's vocation is habitual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps compulsively buying Ebola products is itself a disease? If so, an epidemic of that too is brewing. Some people think the virus is all part of a conspiracy that must be exposed. Others believe it is the dawn of an apocalypse and are planning their survival. Then there are the people who just need to laugh in the face of so much sombre news (thankfully, we don't see many of the faces of the people dying). Where there is this kind of demand, there will be supply. Here's a selection of what's on offer:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halloween costume: Alarm your friends by arriving at their Halloween party dressed as a health worker risking their life to save others. Accessorise with a spray canister full of green vodka, if you can find one. NB: Suit offers no actual protection from Ebola. NBB: Suit doesn't need to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Books: Still not read enough about Ebola? From scientific histories to survivalist handbooks and crackpot fantasies, everything that could possibly be written about the disease already has been, at some length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola thong: I have tried to imagine the right time and place to reveal to somebody that you are wearing an Ebola thong, and I have failed. Maybe it's all about how it makes you feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virus doll: Children have fluffy toy lions and tigers, so why not deadly viruses? &quot;The T rex of microbes,&quot; says the seller's website and, less plausibly, &quot;great teaching tool&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tie: Finally there is an ethical way to dress unpleasantly for work while at the same time taking a lighthearted look at people being dangerously ill. An unspecified &quot;portion of proceeds&quot; goes to &quot;important non-profit public health agencies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bumper stickers: You can like Barack Obama or dislike Barack Obama. But can you really blame him for the evolution of a virus first identified thousands of miles away when he was 15? Hell, yeah!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iPhone case: I imagine the Chinese factory worker who makes these asking his line manager what they are and being told: &quot;Oh it's just the logo of an American sitcom from the 1990s redesigned with the name of a deadly virus and then printed on the back of a range of iPhone cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prayer candle: Once again, &quot;a portion&quot; of the proceeds from this item goes towards Ebola relief. And yet it's hard not to feel that the purchaser could do even more good by maybe, just this once, not buying mystical prayer equipment and instead sending all the money to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apps: The Ebola news aggregator looks harmless, if a little obsessive. The About Ebola app - in Krio, Jola, Liberian English and other African languages - looks downright useful. Yet it is Plague Virus Outbreak with its &quot;80 levels of virus-busting puzzle arcade action&quot; that gets the rave reviews. &quot;Highly infectious&quot;, boasts its website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shopping trolley handle cover: Some say this is merely a conventional CartCuff with the word &quot;Ebola&quot; added to the listing. Others say that if you reach the point where you are spending $5 in order not to catch Ebola from a shopping trolley, you are ill already.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screening for passengers arriving at airports in the UK and US will have little chance of detecting someone infected with the virus and will cost money that could be better spent, a paper in the Lancet medical journal warns today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings come as Gatwick airport said it will begin screening passengers arriving from countries at risk of Ebola, following Heathrow airport, which began screening last week. It was also announced that the international development secretary, Justine Greening, will join British troops heading to Sierra Leone to help with the fight against Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors of the paper say restricting air travel from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia is damaging to the countries' economies and may potentially handicap efforts to end the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper is written by Dr Kamran Khan of St Michael's hospital in Toronto, and colleagues. The team, which calculated that fewer than three people a month infected with Ebola are likely to try to board planes out of west Africa, argue that exit screening in the capital cities of Conakry, Freetown and Monrovia &quot;would offer greater efficiency, and might be simpler to operationalise, than entry screening all flights arriving directly from affected countries&quot;. But such a move needs support from the international community. A lot of attention has been focused on ways in which affluent countries can protect their populations, Khan told the Guardian. But, he said, &quot;the most proactive way is to decrease the many new infections in the source region itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His argument was reinforced yesterday when Nigeria was declared Ebola-free in what the World Health Organisation's director for Nigeria, Rui Gama Vaz, described as a &quot;spectacular success story&quot;. The way they beat the virus could serve as a model for the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak began in Nigeria when a Liberian man, Patrick Sawyer, flew to Lagos on 20 July against medical advice. He was visibly ill when he boarded the plane and collapsed at the airport, but was treated for malaria because he denied he had been in contact with Ebola. It took three days, during which time nine medical staff nursing him became infected, four of whom later died, before Ebola was diagnosed and he was placed in isolation. He died two days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the virus was confirmed, a public health effort began. Every person who may have been exposed to the virus had to be found and isolated if they developed symptoms. Even though that involved hunting through crowded buildings, Nigerian teams managed to trace everyone who had been in contact with Sawyer and everyone who had contact with those who later developed the disease. In total, 19 people became ill in Nigeria, seven of whom died. It could have been much worse in Nigeria's densely populated cities. But Nigeria set up an emergency operations centre, staffed with many experts who work on polio eradication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a paper written by some of those involved, in the journal Eurosurveillance, the list of contacts reached 898, and they were not all in Lagos. A nurse who became infected travelled more than 310 miles to Enugu, finding at least 21 contacts. But the biggest crisis was caused by one of Sawyer's contacts, who had been infected, fleeing to Port Harcourt, where he infected a doctor. That doctor, who died, was linked to 526 contacts, including many members of his church who carried out a healing ceremony for him involving the laying on of hands. In total, the contact tracers made 18,500 face-to-face visits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Department of Defense and the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry (MOCI) over the weekend held a business development forum and promised to buy locally to help boost the country'seconomy that has been affected due to the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the US Department of Defense in partnership with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry Business Development Forum held at a local hotel in Monrovia, the Deputy Commander General of US Army Africa, Peter Corey, said Liberia is like a home because he has travelled all around the country and has friends so it is a great pleasure and it touches his heart to help at this time where the country is at an Ebola crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General Corey stated that their primary focus is to determine how best they could support military men and women work in those counties while promoting businesses of the country in which they have their operations. He said one of their primary objectives of Africa is to build cardinal capacity and at the same time they are looking at ways to save the US tax payers' dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if goods or services are purchased locally and they do not have to send for goods from the US or and part of the globe then they can help save their tax payers' money. He said they have already done the same in Niger and Djibouti and they have had a great success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General Corey added that they will have a wide presence in Liberia for some months to come which depends on how well they get after the epidemic and how quickly they defect Ebola. He added that as they are here they see it as a global mission because Ebola is a serious threat to the entire international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to work with you as Liberian brothers and sisters to get after this epidemic. We believe working collaboratively we will have success in defeating this disease and while we are here we believe that there are great business opportunities which will help the Liberia's economy that has been affected due to the Ebola outbreak, &quot; he asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General Corey concluded that the group of experts from the US Defense Logistics Agency will take Liberian business operators through every process and procedures that the United States has and to help to understand how to do business with the US Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also making remark at the forum, Commerce Minister, Axel Addy, said that Ebola is a virus menace that thrives on human kindness, and it will take a global response of human kindness to defeat it. &quot;Our cultural norms, how we greet each other, how we take care of our sick, how we value the sanctity and dignity of death, now serve as a super highway for the spread of this disease,&quot; the Minister intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Min. Addy stated that the World Bank has predicted the impact of Ebola on the country's economy that will be catastrophic if the epidemic is not attended to. He said the country's GDP is falling dramatically and could be negative by 2015 if Ebola is not contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;Short-term impact on revenue is a $116 million dollars loss. Government is the biggest spender in town, and thus this has had a dramatic impact on the private sector. Steady inflation on food prices due to shortage, panic buying and speculation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Min. Addy expressed that despite the stringent measure put in place at various ports of entries to mitigate any risk of infection, insurance premiums are on an increase for commodities importation and there has been a drop in commercial air traffic into our country and business operators are facing very difficult times in finding customers for their goods and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This initiative shows US Government's commitment to contributing to our country's economic recovery by making every effort to buy locally, because when you do, you create jobs for Liberians,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Min. Addy concluded that they will work with operators and support them (operators) in whatever way they can to ensure them (operators) of success stories of the initiative. &quot;To the team, we will continue working to work with you to encourage you to buy locally within your standards,&quot; Addy added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases of Ebola are said to be dropping from 10-3 per day at various Ebola Treatment Units in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For ELWA Two, it is reported that in September the Center received over 520 Ebola patients with over 142 survivals and approximately 290 deaths and currently there are 54 patients and 41 have been confirmed at that unit while the Island Clinic ETU received 384 patients with 103 survivors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Jerry Brown of ELWA-Two and Atai Omoruto of the Island Clinic ETU have both admitted that the troops of patients taken at their various Centers have decreased numerically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Ministry of Information Culture and Tourism regular Ebola press briefing yesterday, Dr. Brown said the ELWA holding unit now converted to a treatment unit has been receiving between two to three patients in the past few weeks as compared to the past two months where they had to admit over nine to 10 persons per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Omoruto, a Ugandan, also confirmed that the cases of Ebola have reduced as well but is not sure if it is the reality in the communities or people are just not reporting to the ETUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Omoruto, several patients have been discharged from the Island Clinic ETU while more patients currently undergoing treatment are expected to be discharged anytime soon because they are responding to treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in relation to the death of one of the four doctors who joined in the Ebola fight from its onset at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center, Dr. Omoruto described it as unfortunate and a regrettable situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Dr. Scotland's early departure due to Ebola could be attributed to the walk out protest by health workers at the Island Clinic ETU where he was being kept, treated and monitored before being transferred to Bomi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Omoruto, Dr. Scotland could have survived if the health workers who were assigned at the Island Clinic didn't leave their work in protest which led the deceased to willfully request his transfer to Dr. Logan in Tubmanburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Dr. Scotland was later brought back to the Island Clinic ETU but by then his breathing system was deteriorating and his organs were all mal-functioning and there was barely anything they could do to save his life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were in contact with a person who had ebola and the time period for them to get ebola has lapsed. It is over. They do not have ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Troh, 54, spent three weeks confined to a home, undergoing twice-daily temperature readings by government healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, it was announced that a third Dallas hospital worker tested negative for ebola. The woman disembarked a cruise ship where she had been quarantined in Galveston, Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, health officials in Ohio are monitoring more than 100 people following a visit by one of the infected Dallas nurses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">946 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no one in his or her 'sound mind', as we locally say, who would not happily rejoice over reports that the number of cases about the Ebola virus that has now claimed the lives of about 2000 Liberians, is gradually reducing in the country. Since its outbreak, in the past six months, the virus, which has concomitantly affected normal lives in all sectors of the country, the country is said to have taken the lives of Liberians, increasing the number of orphans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, the outbreak has led to some actions, such as travel restrictions on flight that have discontinued to operate in this country. As a nation, the government has declared a State of Emergency and has correspondingly taken measures and actions to help curtail the spread. It has quarantined certain areas and has imposed a curfew to restrict people's movement, since one of the ways people contact the disease is through body contacts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As President Sirelaf rightly observed in her recent letter to the world about what the virus disease has done to Liberia in particular, she pointed out that the virus disease has brought the country to a standstill. &quot;The virus has been able to spread so rapidly because of the insufficient strength of the emergency, medical and military services that remain under-resourced and without the preparedness to confront such a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, she said 2,000 Liberians have died, some who are children struck down in the prime of their youth, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters or best friends, including many brave health workers that risked their lives to save others, or simply offer victims comfort in their final moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the consequences of the virus, measures have been put into place, with various groups on the national level and in various communities joining the war to confront this pestilence on the nation. Also, the concern and assistance of friendly countries and members of the international community, has greatly contributed to filling some of the gaps that have been exposed since the outbreak of this disease that has also affected neighboring countries -Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, as the nation welcomes this latest news about the reduction in the number of cases since the last few months, one cannot speak of this success, without mentioning the role being played by some members of the international community and some local groups and institutions as well as churches; the Indian Association, the Lebanese Community, Mandingo Caucus, Ecobank, Winners Incorporated, J. Luther Tarpeh, UNESCO Peace Ambassador to Liberia, just to name a few. Let me also recognize the role of few countries, including America, India, China, Nigeria and Ghana, as well as the World Bank and the World Health Organization, the African Union for continuously showing concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the reduction in the number of Ebola cases yesterday at the daily press briefing at the Information Ministry, it was gathered that the number of Ebola cases per day has now reduced from 10 to three. At ELWA Two, it is reported that in September the Center received over 520 Ebola patients with over 142 survivors and approximately 290 deaths and currently there are 54 patients and 41 have been confirmed at that unit while the Island Clinic ETU received 384 patients with 103 survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors Jerry Brown of ELWA-Two and Atai Omoruto of the Island Clinic ETU have both admitted that the troops of patients taken at their various Centers have decreased numerically. Dr. Brown said the ELWA holding unit now converted to a treatment unit has been receiving between two to three patients in the past few weeks as compared to the past two months where they have to admit over nine to 10 persons per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Dr. Omoruto, a Ugandan, also confirmed that the cases of Ebola have reduced as well but is not sure if it is the reality in the communities or people are just not reporting to the ETUs. She said several patients have been discharged from the Island Clinic ETU while more patients currently undergoing treatment are expected to be discharged anytime soon because they are responding to treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, while the reduction in the number of cases is good news for this nation, whose citizens have to undergo certain measures to combat this disease, what matters now is to keep abiding by the measures, which I believe have significantly contributed to this drastic reduction from 10 cases to three daily. They include reporting about people who are ill and showing the signs or symptoms of the virus and washing of hands, one measure that has become prevalent in every society as well as avoiding some practices such as bathing dead bodies, touching of dead bodies and testing of temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we can pat ourselves on the back for this reduction in the Ebola case. Notwithstanding, we have to continue to abide by the measures to see this disease completely leave this country, which was once devastated by civil conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot afford what has now befallen us. Hence, the only way out is to be law-abiding as it regards enforcing the measures. This is no time for complacency, as this would be counter-productive to all efforts to curtail this virus. Today, the Federal Republic of Nigeria has been declared Ebola-free; we too, can be in few weeks, only if we keep the measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, there should be no room for COMPLACENCY, but to continue to abide by all of the measures in this battle to defeat Ebola. The anti-Ebola measures, in place today, are the laws we MUST obey to defeat Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we abidingly keep carrying out these measurers, this good news would be ephemeral, thus defeating the purpose of these measures, I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jefferson D.tweh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">263 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bishop of the City Light Church of God located in Bardnersville Estate,Rev. John Kun Kun says anyone who wants to make profit of the deadly Ebola virus that is claiming the lives of many people in the country, will definitely lose because God has spoken that Ebola is going out of Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Kun said some individuals are taking advantage of the nation and also using the nation to satisfy their desires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the press conference last week Sunday, Bishop Kun told journalists that Liberians should have hope and they must not be panic because God will do everything to protect them and Ebola does not have power. He said the power of Ebola has broken over the nation and will never surface in Liberia again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Kun added that he has differed with World Health Organization (WHO) statement made recently that 10,000 persons will be affected by the deadly Ebola virus weekly. He averred that by the power of God, that will not happen and the statement made by WHO cannot be true, because statistics showed that since the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, only 8,000 persons have died so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now everyone is taking serious preventive measures as prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in the country to avoid contracting the virus and International Community is also helping to kick the virus out of Liberia, and how can WHO predict that 10,000 persons will be affected weekly? That is unbelievable, &quot;Bishop Kun Kun expressed concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Bishop John Kun Kun has urged Liberians to take courage because God is in control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DYING patients could be given access to untested medicines from early next year after the Government and senior doctors gave their backing to a Bill proposed by Lord Saatchi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has thrown his department's weight behind the Medical Innovation Bill, which will make it easier for doctors to try out new treatments on patients without the fear of being sued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill - which has divided the medical profession - has also received tentative backing from the General Medical Council (GMC), which in April came out firmly against any change in the law, and a leading cancer charity. The legislation was proposed by Lord Saatchi, the advertising entrepreneur, who began campaigning on the issue after his wife, Josephine Hart, died from ovarian cancer. Lord Saatchi told The Daily Telegraph that the principle of allowing new drugs to be tested on desperately ill people was already being applied in the case of Ebola victims in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In dealing with the deadly Ebola outbreak, the World Health Organisation has decided that departure from standard evidence-based treatment is fully justi-fied and essential,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has set ethical guidelines for the use of new therapies and interventions - they are identical to the provisions of the Medical Innovation Bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters said that the plans - which could be law by March if MPs and peers agree - will allow victims of rare cancers to volunteer to be treated with untried drugs. Bypassing the need for years of clinical trials will bring down the cost of the medicine and may make pharmaceutical firms more likely to fund experimental drugs that only help a small number of people with rare diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill will be debated in the Lords on Friday and is due to be considered by MPs in the Commons in December. Supporters said it now had a 75 per cent chance of becoming law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has decided to support the Bill after new safeguards were agreed with Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, doctors routinely ask hospital colleagues for an opinion before departing from standard treatment for patients in what is called the &quot;Bolam test&quot;. The amended Bill will require them to seek consent from other specialists in the field before trying out untested medical treatments. Mr Hunt is hoping the extra safeguard for patients will see off claims the Bill is a &quot;quacks' charter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Department of Health said: &quot;Innovation is at the heart of modernising the NHS and is essential for improving treatments and finding new cures and work on the Medical Innovation Bill is ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pleased that Lord Saatchi has tabled amendments to the Bill to help ensure patient and staff safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source added: &quot;The Government is currently minded to support the Bill as amended by Lord Saatchi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendments have persuaded the GMC to give its tentative support for the change in the law. Prof Sir Peter Rubin, the GMC chairman, said: &quot;Medicine is a risky business. There are many people alive today because of the willingness of doctors to innovate, deal with uncertainty and take reasonable risks which are understood, shared with, and consented to, by the patient in accordance with good medical practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we welcome the amendments to the Bill in Lord Saatchi's name, we look forward to seeing the final version.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cancer Research UK, which had expressed concerns about the first draft of the Bill, also now supports the change in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Woolnough, the charity's director of Policy and Information, said it was important for Parliament to discuss medical innovation and said the Bill &quot;aims to support clinicians to act innovatively where they have exhausted other options&quot;. She said the amendments &quot;are an improvement&quot;, but &quot;we will monitor the Bill's progress closely&quot;. She added: &quot;We must ensure the Bill contains appropriate safeguards to protect patients.&quot; Some doctors remained concerned. Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery at University College London, said: &quot;Never once have we encountered interference or obstruction due to fear of litigation. There are of course many other obstacles to progress but changing the law with this Bill is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, as a result of unintended consequences, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPAIN, Norway and Luxembourg have together donated less money to the global fight against Ebola than Ikea, according to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the three European countries have committed less than &pound;2.5million, in comparison to a donation of &pound;4.2million from the Swedish furniture seller. Britain has given &pound;125million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour has demanded that countries not meeting their responsibilities be named, while David Cameron has written to 27 fellow European leaders telling them to &quot;step up&quot; donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A British nurse who caught Ebola in Sierra Leone and survived was last night due back there. William Pooley, 29, from Eyke in Suffolk, said doctors were unsure whether he would now be immune, but he wanted to return and try to help prevent more deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Western governments faced further pressure over their response to the crisis in West Africa, which has killed more than 4,500 people, Barack Obama, the US president, criticised his senior aides for their handling of the disease in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama was visibly angry as he gathered officials in the Cabinet room at the White House, the New York Times reported. The president reportedly told staff he was &quot;not satisfied&quot; with the handling of the crisis, adding: &quot;It's not tight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of his anger was directed at the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention over indecision about the level of the threat and failing to ensure staff at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas were sufficiently trained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, the only person to have died from the disease in the US, was treated at the Texas hospital and two nurses there - Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, contracted Ebola from him. They are being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Texas hospital ran a full-page apology in the Dallas Morning News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview, Dr Gary Weinstein, who treated Mr Duncan, angrily denied suggestions that the patient had not received the best care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CDC had allowed Miss Vinson to board a flight from Dallas to Cleveland, Ohio, to prepare for her wedding. The number of people in Ohio now being monitored for signs of the disease has risen to more than 100, including her six bridesmaids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sense of panic spread to a cruise ship when it emerged that a laboratory technician who handled blood samples from Mr Duncan at the Dallas hospital had been allowed to take a cruise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Carnival Magic set sail from Galveston, Texas, on Oct 12. Several days into the cruise the technician identified herself to the captain and went into quarantine in her cabin. As the ship arrived back in Galveston a blood test taken from her came back negative for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A blood test on a Spanish nursing assistant who became the first person to be infected with Ebola in Europe has come back clear, according to a statement issued yesterday on behalf of the Spanish prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The test showed that Teresa Romero's body was clear of all traces of the virus, according to the statement released by Mariano Rajoy's office. Doctors in Madrid are now awaiting the results of a second test to confirm the all-clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Romero, 44, treated two patients who died of Ebola at the hospital earlier this month after travelling from Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following facts about this unfortunate incident duly emerged.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presiding officers made the decision to ban head wear without reference to the AFP or to Asio.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was made on the basis that parliament house was at imminent risk of a protest from people - possibly men - wearing burqas, who intended to disrupt Question Time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody could quite recall how that information came into the shared domain until a DPS official could, in fact, recall it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information came from police, who got the information from a media crew on the forecourt of parliament house.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It later turned out that said media crew had got the information from a tips and rumours line on 2UE. Naturally, the protest never eventuated. As a consequence, a ban was issued and relations between the parliament and the Muslim community were damaged very badly for absolutely no reason.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just because national affairs hadn't quite covered itself in enough glory - then there was an outbreak of semantics. Tony Abbott said on October 3 he'd sought a reversal of the burqa ban from the Speaker. Bronwyn Bishop said the request didn't happen because it wasn't a formal request, even though she wasn't actually asked whether the request was informal or formal, just whether or not there had been one.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just for the remaining segment of the population still interested in facts, this is what what has got Richard di Natale upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was advice from police at the parliament house security briefing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some simple things that can certainly help us and help DPS in providing a safe and secure environment at parliament house. As mentioned we want you to wear your pass, we want it visibly displayed. We want you to consider your environment, ensure that if you're in an external office - closing blinds, reducing line of sight external to the building. If you have people wandering around that you're not sure of, ask them what their business is. If you're not comfortable doing that please approach a PSS or an AFP member and we would be more than happy to engage that person in that regard. Consider your own personal movement, personal routines. Some common sense approaches around varying timings, routines, locations that you undertake you physical activity, the way your drive into work - that sort of thing. </SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 19 Tony Abbott referred to &quot;chatter&quot; about parliament house. &quot;The chatter involving parliament house was chatter between Australians in Syria and Iraq and their supporters here in Australia. Numbers of AFP in parliament house are ramping up already, the armed element in parliament house will increase and people will notice that security in parliament house is tighter, very quickly.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does this fit with the evidence given today that the threat level at parliament house has not changed since 2010? Surely the threat level would increase in such circumstances? What am I missing here? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Paul Farrell is watching immigration estimates and has kindly sent me this update: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senate legal and constitutional affairs committee has just gotten very interesting. There has been considerable debate about recent events on Nauru, after allegations were made against Save the Children staff that they may have breached Commonwealth disclosure laws. The allegations were contained in a Transfield intelligence report, and the matter has been referred to the AFP for investigation. In response Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has referred the immigration minister's office for investigation to the AFP to determine how the Transfield report found its way into the hands of the Daily Telegraph several weeks ago. But in a strange twist it now appears that Hanson-Young has obtained her own copy of the Transfield document that contains the central allegations, which she began distributing to senators during the estimates hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Committee chair senator Ian Macdonald realised what the senator was attempting to table he halted proceedings so the committee could debate whether or not they would allow the document to be tabled. The committee considered the matter in closed chambers. The committee has refused to allow the report to be tabled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macdonald: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee has endorsed my ruling that the document cannot be tabled on the basis of which we understand it to be, and we'll take it from there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rumours  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This day is unbelievably superb. Officials in estimates have now given evidence that the police got their information about the supposed burqa protest on October 2 from.. wait for it.. the TV crew on the forecourt of parliament house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, to recap: we have a crew relaying a rumour to police, who then relayed a rumour to DPS, who then relayed a rumour to the presiding officers, who then proceeded to ban women in burqas from the public galleries. Oh yes, and the protest NEVER HAPPENED. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The threat level at parliament house is the same as it was in 2010  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I'm wrangling the response from the PMO, and peppering you with Lewis Carroll, the finance committee of estimates is going full random. Green senator Richard di Natale is going back over a briefing that was given at the height of the enhanced security hysteria at parliament house. I actually chose not to report it at the time, given I could not fathom the public interest in sharing matters that are not normally shared. But I think it's ok to go there now, in an environment of relative calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a police briefing several weeks ago, occupants of the building were advised to keep away from the windows to avoid snipers, and vary their routes to work if they felt concerned. Apparently. I wasn't there, but this is fact, according to accounts from people who were there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carol Mills is asked about this advice, did she agree with it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have certainly not closed my blinds nor varied my route to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further questioning yields a more than salient fact. The threat level at parliament house is the same as it was in 2010. It's medium - despite AFP blokes wandering around with machine guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mills: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's correct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 4.34pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems a shame,&quot; the Walrus said, &quot;to play them such a trick, After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I weep for you,&quot; the Walrus said: &quot;I deeply sympathize.&quot; With sobs and tears he sorted out/Those of the largest size/Holding his pocket-handkerchief/ Before his streaming eyes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime minister's office response to Bishop on the burqa ban  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've had a conversation with the prime minister's office this afternoon to try and ascertain why Tony Abbott said on October 3 that he'd asked the Speaker to reverse the burqa ban, and Madam Speaker told parliament today that he did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the response from the PMO: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister spoke to the speaker the day the revised security arrangements were announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made clear his views on the changed arrangements. No formal request was made to change the arrangements as they are a matter for the presiding officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, essentially, their explantion is he did speak to her, and indicate his (negative) view about the events to of the day - but given the bureaucratic technicalities (these issues are a matter for the presiding officers) - it was not a formal request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an informal request. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 4.17pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is Senator Heffernan, who ignores the suggestion from Bernardi to be on his best behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heffernan, to the head of DPS, Carol Mills :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear you've been to see the Queen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mills: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May I say the Queen chose not to see me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 4.12pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has issued a warning in the finance committee. Senator Bill Heffernan is expected at any moment. The pause which follows that update is as significant as his Law and Order moment earlier today. The earlier pause was confusion. This pause could denote dread. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate president Stephen Parry is persisting meanwhile with his various explanations and rationales concerning the burka ban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no point in banning people if they can come back into the building disguised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.54pm AEST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Walrus and the Carpenter/Walked on a mile or so/And then they rested on a rock/Conveniently low:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And all the little Oysters stood/And waited in a row. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come,&quot; the Walrus said, &quot;to talk of many things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of shoes/and ships/and sealing-wax/Of cabbages/and kings/And why the sea is boiling hot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And whether pigs have wings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what Tony Abbott said the day after the controversy on October 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a lot of grey area here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, yesterday the presiding officers made an interim decision that people wearing burqas and other attire that obscured the face wouldn't be allowed in the public galleries, they'd have to go into the glassed-in galleries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I asked the Speaker to rethink that decision and my understanding is that it was an interim decision, that it would be looked at again in the light of security advice that will come in coming days and I'm sure that the matter will be fully resolved before the parliament comes back in a fortnight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very curious, this. On the night of October 2, the prime minister's office briefed that Abbott would seek a reversal of the ban. But both the presiding officers - Bronwyn Bishop and Stephen Parry - say this didn't happen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Bishop consult the AFP or Asio? The Speaker doesn't answer that question directly. (The Senate president Stephen Parry said earlier today that neither Asio nor the AFP were consulted.) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: You did recommend a number of areas where there was strong safeguards and more oversight was needed. Did the government overreach a little bit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tehan: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think they overreached. They consulted with the intelligence agencies, with the federal police and with the community, and then put in the legislation what it thought, on balance, needed to be done. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously the committee has had another look at that and we have put forward some recommendations but the important thing was we heard evidence from both the Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security saying that they have the oversight powers to be able to deal with this legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watt had indicated to Labor (by way of correspondence) that he would attend finance estimates if invited to attend by the committee.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in Medibank Private will be sold for between $1.55 and $2 each, indicating the share float could raise the government between $4.3bn and $5.5bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, announced details of the share float of the government-owned private health insurer in Melbourne this morning. He said Australian retail investors would be able to apply for shares from 28 October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A price cap for retail investors means that Australian residents who choose to apply for shares will not pay any more than $2.00 per share, even if the final price is set above the indicative range,&quot; Cormann said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the indicative price range, the indicative market capitalisation of Medibank Private would be $4,269 - $5,508 million, which would place it among the top 100 companies on the ASX.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government intended to sell down its entire shareholding and use the funds on its asset recycling scheme to encourage infrastructure construction. More than 750,000 Australians pre-registered their interest in receiving a share offer prospectus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being pressed - Parry finally coughs up that Asio and the AFP were not involved in that particular decision. The agencies did not seek to seggregate people in full face coverings. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senate president defends the ban as a prudent decision in the circumstances given the specific risk on the day.

She says there was, initially, no suggestion the intention of the group was to disrupt Question Time. Callinan is going through events on the day, various meetings to determine a response.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labor's John Faulkner has ever so politely nudged Penny Wong to the side. He'd like to know about meetings of parliament's security management board. Parry has essentially told the committee the security management board has not met formally either before the burqa ban was imposed, or after that decision was made. He means the presiding officers have met with various people informally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faulkner isn't impressed. </SPAN></P>

I received briefings from Iraqi leaders and international coalition partners on the campaign against ISIL and the current political situation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of additional lines of context on Bronwyn Bishop in Burqa Backflip again from Daniel Hurst - who worked yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presiding officers of Australia's parliament house have backed down from a controversial decision to segregate Muslim women wearing facial coverings such as burqas or niqabs in the public galleries. The speaker, Bronwyn Bishop, and the Senate president, Stephen Parry, met on Sunday to reconsider the &quot;interim access arrangements&quot; announced just over two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop and Parry faced criticism over the decision to force visitors wearing facial coverings to sit in a separate area of parliament's public gallery shielded by glass panels. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, had called on the pair to rethink the segregation policy, noting that all members of the public in the galleries had already cleared airport-style security checkpoints.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just for all the estimates nerds out there (besides me, I mean.) You know who you are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I've flagged, today's inquisitorial magic undertaken in small committee rooms includes Senate president Parry coming before the Finance and Administration committee; immigration officials at Legal and Constitutional Affairs; infrastructure and regional development at the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport committee; and environment in the spotlight at Environment and Communications committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reader would prefer Bronwyn Bishop in burqa backflip on the basis that it sounds more acrobatic. More power to that arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This stunning outbreak of basic common sense won't stop Labor from running an inquisition about this issue in Senate estimates later this morning. Of key interest will be what advice the prime minister's office gave to the presiding officers concerning the initial ruling, which banned head coverings in the main public gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, responding to the news this morning on Twitter: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's welcome that the Speaker has reversed ruling on the burqa/niqab. Segregation has no place in our parliament; common sense has prevailed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had also expected to hear more today about the controversy in the last sitting concerning the security arrangements for parliament house - specifically, the controversy concerning head coverings for Muslim women visiting the people's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I note that the department of parliamentary services has just issued the following backdown.. sorry.. advice: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All visitors entering Parliament House will be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features. This will enable DPS security staff to identify any person who may have been banned from entering Parliament House or who may be known, or discovered, to be a security risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once this process has taken place, visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building, including all chamber galleries, with facial coverings in place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, good morning, blogans, bloganistas, and welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant early morning news is the foreign minister Julie Bishop has settled the relevant legal authority for special forces to enter Iraq in their &quot;advise and assist&quot; role. Readers of Politics Live will know that the completion of this paperwork has taken some period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abbott government has been making it clear for weeks that special forces are ready to go, ready to go, ready to go go go, did we say ready to go. (Yes, it is that kind of morning.) But the government has also been making it plain that &quot;ready to go&quot; does not mean ready to go without an underpinning legal framework. That now appears done, thanks to Bishop, who has been meeting key Iraqi government people in Baghdad over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This development of course draws Australia further into a dangerous conflict in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1051 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a column ostensibly explaining why moderates struggle in the Republican party, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen last year wrote: &quot;People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York - a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts - but not all - of America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the thought of New York's first family's interracial marriage makes many Republicans gag, imagine how many sick bags they are filling over Ebola. The arrival of the virus in America has crystallised a range of Conservative anxieties: immigration, race, terrorism, science, big government, Barack Obama - you name it. For the right, Ebola is not just a disease, it is a metaphor for some of the things they don't understand and many of the things they loathe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative eminence grise Phyllis Schlafly believes Obama is allowing it into the country deliberately. &quot;Obama doesn't want America to believe that we're exceptional,&quot; she said. &quot;He wants us to be just like everybody else, and if Africa is suffering from Ebola, we ought to join the group and be suffering from it, too.&quot; Rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh claims liberals won't impose a travel ban from infected areas because Ebola is &quot;payback&quot; for slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roots of this fear-mongering are deep, and when Ebola finally landed it fell on fertile soil. First, it came from abroad - a place that many Conservatives are both afraid of and resent. Republicans are the most likely to be against immigration, for bombing Isis, to believe that America's global power is declining, and to fear globalisation. They've wanted to build a huge wall on the Mexican border for years. Ebola breaking out on the other side of the globe has simply added to their siege mentality. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Republican senate candidate for North Carolina Thom Tillis said in a debate recently. &quot;We have an Ebola outbreak, we have bad actors who can come across the border. We need to seal the border and secure it.&quot; South Carolina congressman Joe Wilson last week warned that Hamas might deliberately bring Ebola sufferers into the US through Mexico illegally. You couldn't make it up. There have been three confirmed cases of Ebola in the US and none in Mexico - if anyone should be sealing the border to protect themselves from the virus it should be the Mexicans keeping Americans out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, it's coming from Africa - a continent about which Conservatives apparently know little: while being briefed on foreign affairs during the 2008 campaign, vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin asked her tutors whether &quot;South Africa was part of the country&quot; (of Africa)? Four years later, Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney's main rival, argued that thanks to Aids and the threat of radical Islam &quot;(Africa) was a country on the brink&quot;. Limbaugh thinks Sierra Leone was founded by &quot;British African American slaves&quot; - whoever they are. One of the reasons the government can't ban direct flights from the infected west African countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - is because there are no direct flights from those countries to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, Ebola makes the case for government: an institution Conservatives have no love for. It is an issue of public health to which no individual or privatised response can make any substantial, meaningful contribution. To fight an epidemic like Ebola you need a well-resourced public sector, well-trained government employees, central planning and coordination and a respect for science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, we have not seen a lot of this either from the Centers for Disease Control or the Obama administration, whose response to the outbreak has been confused. Obama is said to be seething at his team's efforts. Coming so soon after an intruder made it into the White House, and just a year after the botched healthcare rollout, his administration is getting a reputation for incompetence that only confirms the right's conspiracy theories. Fighting Ebola doesn't just need government; it needs competent governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, it makes the case for public healthcare. In 2012, 43% of Americans reported not getting the medical care they needed because of costs. The figure for the uninsured is far higher. Fearing high bills and long waits at emergency rooms, the uninsured generally wait to see if an ailment is really serious before seeking assistance. Imagine how likely they would be to seek immediate help for a temperature and, if they did turn out to have Ebola, how many people they might infect before they did. About a quarter of Texans, the state where the outbreak is centred, do not have medical insurance. (That includes Thomas Eric Duncan, the only person to die from Ebola in the US.) It would be less but Texas governor, Rick Perry, refused to cooperate with the federal government to expand Medicaid under the provisions of Obamacare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Ebola serves as a proxy for the many long-held Conservative prejudices about Obama - that he is an African-born interloper come to destroy America. A 2010 poll showed that just under a third of Republicans believed Obama was a &quot;racist who hates white people&quot;. Michael Savage, another rightwing radio host, calls him &quot;Obola&quot;. &quot;Obama wants equality and he wants fairness, and it's only fair that America have a nice epidemic or two . . . to really feel what it's like to be in the third world. You have to look at it from the point of view of a leftist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the point of view of this leftist, what really terrifies the right about Ebola is that it shows - albeit in a deadly, scary, tragic way - that we are all connected. It shows that no matter how strong the gates around your community, how high the wall on your border, how sophisticated the alarm on your house; no matter how much you avoid state schools, public transport and public libraries; no matter how much you pay the premium to retreat from the public sphere - you cannot escape both your own humanity and the humanity of others, and the fact that our fates are tied. If you want to feel secure in Texas, regardless of your race, income or religion, it's in your interests that people have healthcare in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">857 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British nurse who survived Ebola has flown back to Sierra Leone expressing fears that the world will return to indifference about the plight of Africans when the crisis abates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Pooley will resume work today in an Ebola isolation unit run by a team backed by three NHS trusts and a London university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he could not see anything changing in attitudes towards Africa, where diseases such as malaria have already killed 70 times more people than Ebola this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Suffolk-born nurse said it had been an easy decision to return despite the worries of his family and friends. He has said that he could not stand idly by and watch more die. &quot;I chose to go before and it was the right thing to do then and it's still the right thing to do now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is widely assumed that a person cannot contract Ebola twice, this is not scientifically proven and Pooley has been warned that he still faces a risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have told me I very likely have immunity, at least for the near future, to this strain of Ebola. I have also been told it's a possibility that I don't, so I will just have to act as if I don't,&quot; he told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was keen to return to alleviate suffering and put the fuss about his own brush with the disease behind him. Before leaving he demonstrated typical selflessness, banking 1.2 litres of plasma in a lab in Birmingham to help WHO research on a &quot;convalescent plasma therapy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of it might be used for research and consent has been given. It may be possible to use it for any future patients,&quot; he said. Pooley has also had white blood cells harvested for research. Last month he flew to the US, where he gave a further three litres over six days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on the ward at the Connaught hospital in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, he will wear full personal protective equipment, including mask, goggles and special overalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're going to get the virus on yourself and you need to dispose of that virus safely. You couldn't walk into the ward in your own clothes. You might be exposed to the virus and then walk out of the ward and potentially other people would be exposed too,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is joining a 10-strong team working with King's Health Partners, a partnership between King's College London and three London NHS trusts: Guys and St Thomas', King's College hospital, and South London and Maudsley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm excited to get back out there. I want to get back to work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King's team, headed by a British doctor, Oliver Johnson, has been at the Connaught since 2013 working on health infrastructure. When the Ebola virus hit in May, it swung operations around to help contain the outbreak. As it went out of control, Johnson worked with the government to set up an Ebola command centre in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fantastic that Will has chosen to join our small team . . . The situation here in Freetown is getting worse by the day,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;Will's experience and commitment will be vital as we do everything we can to flow the stem of cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Pooley was airlifted from Sierra Leone on 25 August, Ebola had already killed 1,400 people. The situation has rapidly deteriorated since and the death toll has now passed 4,500. As the crisis intensifies in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the WHO has warned Ebola could be infecting as many as 10,000 people a week by December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pooley said he understood the concern about an outbreak in Britain or America but urged the public to donate money to fight the &quot;real problem&quot; in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The risk of a really damaging outbreak here (in the UK) is negligible. There's an absolute catastrophe happening in another part of the world, so really that should be our focus,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the WHO admitted it had mishandled the early stages of the outbreak, Pooley said he was pessimistic about attitudes. &quot;I can't really see anything changing. Maybe we will get involved in the Ebola response, but after it's over things will go back to how they've always been,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a total shame we're ignoring all this death going on not too far away, but it's always been the case. It always will be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists and politicians clashed yesterday over the US response to Ebola, while public unease failed to be quelled by an all-clear given to Texas healthcare workers and cruise ship passengers potentially exposed to the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just two weeks to go until closely fought midterm elections, Republican senator Ted Cruz stepped up his criticism of White House policy against travel restrictions, calling for extra border guards and dismissing its argument that medical advice showed quarantines would be counter-productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctors making this argument are working for the administration and repeating their talking points,&quot; said Cruz in an interview on CNN. &quot;The arguments they are giving don't make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criticism was immediately rejected by one of the administration's top scientific advisers who stressed that revised US public health protocols were more than sufficient to contain future transmission and designed to &quot;shave off risk&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never had an experience where the president is telling me to tell him something he wants to hear,&quot; said Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. &quot;There is no such thing as zero risk, but when you get into relative risk, the chances (of infection within the general public), if not zero, are so vanishingly low that there are lots of other things you should worry about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials acknowledge there is a tension between showing the &quot;abundance of caution&quot; needed to reassure people and causing more anxiety by over-reacting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was demonstrated vividly yesterday as a cruise ship at the centre of a high-profile Ebola scare returned to port in Galveston, Texas, having been prevented from docking elsewhere, only to have all tests prove negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lab worker from a Dallas hospital, who may have handled specimens from the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, Thomas Eric Duncan, went into voluntary quarantine in her cabin with her husband last Wednesday after the Carnival cruise operator was told by federal authorities that she was on board and tighter travel protocols were being introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman had already been self-monitoring, taking her temperature daily for fever signs, but isolated herself and stepped up her health checks after fears grew last week that the hospital's procedures had been inadequate and news broke that a nurse had taken a commercial flight the day before developing Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fauci questioned whether the response to the cruise ship was medically necessary, but argued the caution in evidence in recent days was important for reassuring the US public. &quot;You can understand why it was done,&quot; he said. &quot;Fear is something that needs to be respected.&quot; Nevertheless, the passage of a 21-day incubation time limit yesterday for some of the healthcare workers exposed to Duncan when he first attended a hospital in Dallas is providing hope that the transmission to other nurses and medical staff will be limited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years into the economic crisis we can still get days - as with last week's market correction - where the froth blows off the recovery and reveals only something flat and stale beneath. The fundamental economic problems have not been solved: they've just been palliated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today's economy we never quite seem to turn the corner towards rising growth, falling poverty, stabilised public finances. Not so much winter without Christmas, but winter without ever getting to the shortest day. And that is doing something to our psychology. It is destroying our confidence in &quot;agency&quot; - the human ability to avoid danger, mitigate risk, regain control over fluid situations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see it clearest of all in people's attitudes to war and disaster. Earlier this year the editor of the BBC's Today programme admitted they were having trouble retaining listeners in the face of relentless bad news: Syria, Isis, Libya, Gaza. It was not the scale of the horror that turned them off: it was their own powerlessness in the face of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is logical to feel powerless if you witness the best educated and briefed people of your generation flounder - as politicians and diplomats have - in the face of a collapse of global order. But for economists - veterans of Lehman Brothers, Enron and the dotcom boom and bust before them - there is a feeling of deja vu. We know what it's like to get all your preconceptions blown out of the water, and see talented people flounder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In economics, big, uncontrollable forces are the norm; but by understanding them - by charting the rules of the game we're supposed to play - we gain the ability to act. So, as one Lehman trader anecdotally told his new recruit before the crash: &quot;Stay here, keep your head down, do nothing extraordinary and in 20 years you will have a Lamborghini, just like me.&quot; Agency in a normal capitalist system is about knowing the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a disrupted system, power flies to the extremes. The majority of people feel powerless because the rules no longer apply: you can keep your head down, do nothing extraordinary, and still leave the building with only a cardboard box. Meanwhile, for a tiny minority, disrupted systems seem to endow them with kryptonite powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such people set up companies and close them down with ease, long before any requirement to file accounts comes due. A whole new international class of scam-trepreneurs has grown up: running island nightclubs, free porn sites, car-wash businesses we never realised we needed, and finance companies for which there is no adequate label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crisis makes such people hyper-free, but can leave the rest of us paralysed. And with paralysis comes paranoia. For the paralysed individual, nothing is really true; everything seems fabricated by the powers that stand above them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of all this, the average person learns the true meaning of &quot;inshallah&quot;: the Arabic phrase denoting resignation to the will of God. We become resigned to the economy being screwed, resigned to the rich getting richer; resigned to the fact that all wars end in failure, fiasco or injustice. And we're resigned to the possibility that all political heroes - however noble - will betray us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1930s &quot;agency&quot; was restored in dangerous ways: nationalism, fascism, civil war: it was only four years from the Wall Street crash to the rise of Hitler. Our crisis has lasted longer, and although less severe, what it's doing to our heads may be just as corrosive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebuilding the economy, stopping Ebola and bringing order to the Middle East are tasks too big for individuals. But the fight against fatalism starts in the democratic republic of the brain. Of all the civilisations pummelled by austerity, Greece is in deepest. I am amazed by the capacity of its young people to resist fatalism and innovate, whether it's anarchists trying to set up the biggest legal squat in Europe or the entrepreneurs inventing new models or forming startup businesses in the face of withering fire from the Greek bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Lehman crisis erupted I saw it initially in terms of right v left, Hayek v Keynes. Six years later, I've become used to meeting people who believe crisis is the normal state of things, and that they are powerless. The agency problem is clear: too many bad people have the power to act; the vast majority of decent people don't. So regaining our power to act can feel almost more important than what we actually do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now, hundreds of our fellow citizens - civilians and soldiers - are in West Africa voluntarily risking their lives to fight Ebola. That is agency in full working order. If you look at the people clamouring to save Kobane - who include Turkish anarchists, Kurdish guerrillas, freelance journalists and RAF Typhoon crews - that is also agency in full working order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's in the economy that agency remains weak. There is no &quot;medical Swat team&quot; for the world economy, no peshmergas. There are only politicians, central bankers, business managers, workers and consumers, and a lot of them are gripped by fatalism. So one of the most dangerous things about the present is not wild swings in the stock markets - it is the mass psychology of powerlessness. We have very little precedent for understanding its longterm consequences.</SPAN></P>

However, I do not agree that &quot;if the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently.&quot; Mr Annan knows very well that there would be no need for the west to help Africa fight Ebola today if most of the &pound;550bn given to the continent as development aid since independence, had not been diverted to fund local leaders' luxury lifestyles. Yet the insinuation of racism is too often used to morally blackmail western governments into taking, or not taking an action in Africa. For example, last year, the African Union passed a resolution that claimed the west was using the international criminal court (ICC) to witch-hunt African leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

However, reports on the effectiveness of aid from the OECD in 2010 and the UN University in 2013 make no reference to health. The resilience of the health system in the face of Ebola strongly suggests far too little progress has been made. Unless radical improvements are made to primary healthcare and basic services such as sanitation and clean water, Sierra Leone and a multitude of low and middle income countries will remain vulnerable to premature mortality and epidemics. We are surely entitled to ask whether the emphasis on trade and economic development in aid is at the expense of the majority of the populations in many states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For any infective disease, the basic reproduction rate is the number of new cases produced by a single case in a susceptible (ie unvaccinated) population (Simon Jenkins, 17 October). With Ebola the rate is just above 1.5, which means that every two cases produce three more. That is the basis for the WHO prediction that new cases in West Africa will double every month. Without a vaccine, the disease will become progressively more difficult to control as the number of cases increase, and unless quarantine measures are introduced, spread to the rest of the world seems inevitable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">565 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear World</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In just over six months, Ebola has managed to bring my country to a standstill. We have lost over 2,000 Liberians. Some are children struck down in the prime of their youth. Some were fathers, mothers, brothers or best friends. Many were brave health workers that risked their lives to save others, or simply offer victims comfort in their final moments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no coincidence Ebola has taken hold in three fragile states - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - all battling to overcome the effects of interconnected wars. In Liberia, our civil war ended only eleven years ago. It destroyed our public infrastructure, crushed our economy and led to an exodus of educated professionals. A country that had some 3,000 qualified doctors at the start of the war was dependent by its end on barely three dozen. In the last few years, Liberia was bouncing back. We realized there was a long way to go, but the future was looking bright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Ebola threatens to erase that hard work. Our economy was set to be larger and stronger this year, offering more jobs to Liberians and raising living standards. Ebola is not just a health crisis - across West Africa, a generation of young people risk being lost to an economic catastrophe as harvests are missed, markets are shut and borders are closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus has been able to spread so rapidly because of the insufficient strength of the emergency, medical and military services that remain under-resourced and without the preparedness to confront such a challenge. This would have been the case whether the confrontation was with Ebola, another infectious disease, or a natural disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thing is clear. This is a fight in which the whole world has a stake. This disease respects no borders. The damage it is causing in West Africa, whether in public health, the economy or within communities - is already reverberating throughout the region and across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international reaction to this crisis was initially inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency. Now finally, the world has woken up. The community of nations has realized they cannot simply pull up the drawbridge and wish this situation away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fight requires a commitment from every nation that has the capacity to help - whether that is with emergency funds, medical supplies or clinical expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have every faith in our resilience as Liberians, and our capacity as global citizens, to face down this disease, beat it and rebuild. History has shown that when a people are at their darkest hour, humanity has an enviable ability to act with bravery, compassion and selflessness for the benefit of those most in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From governments to international organisations, financial institutions to NGOs, politicians to ordinary people on the street in any corner of the world, we all have a stake in the battle against Ebola. It is the duty of all of us, as global citizens, to send a message that we will not leave millions of West Africans to fend for themselves against an enemy that they do not know, and against whom they have little defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time for talking or theorizing is over. Only concerted action will save my country, and our neighbours, from experiencing another national tragedy. The words of Henrik Ibsen have never been truer: &quot;A thousand words leave not the same deep impression as does a single deed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yours sincerely,</SPAN></P>

He said in response to a letter from the Liberian Foreign Ministry, Cuba will also donate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to the Liberian government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Ngafuan made the disclosure o Thursday when he appeared before the House of Representatives to report on international assistance towards the fight against Ebola in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has engulfed three West African countries including Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and Liberia has so far recorded the highest number of deaths amongst the three West African Countries most affected by the epidemic in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the severity of the situation in Liberia, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf over the weekend wrote the world about the worsening situation facing her country saying that the virus has become a global issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coming of the 50 Cuban doctors will be a major boost in the fight against the vicious virus that continues to claim lives on a daily basis in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The Ebola virus is not just a public health crisis; it has also become a social crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis, and a threat to national security well beyond the outbreak zones; Morrison O.G.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Elections Commission (NEC) will on today publish the final list of candidates for the 2014 Special Senatorial Election. According to the final list of candidates, a total number of 139 persons have been qualified to contest the Special Senatorial Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list shows that ten candidates have been qualified to contest the election in Bomi County while Bong has 13 candidates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of candidates also shows that Gbapolu County has Seven candidates, Grand Bassa has Five, Grand Cape Mount eleven while Grand Gedeh eleven persons have been, Grand Kru Seven Candidates, Lofa has nine candidates, Margibi County 13 candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the list, Maryland County has Eight Candidates, Montserrado eleven, Nimba six, River Gee has nine candidates, River Cess has Twelve Candidates and Sinoe County has a total of Seven Candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list further shows that a total of Twenty-six Independent candidates will contest the Special Senatorial Election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six Counties (Grand Cape Mount, Margibi, Maryland, Nimba, River Gee and river Cess) have one independent candidate each while Six Counties ( Sinoe, Lofa, Grand Kru, Grand Gedeh, Grand Bassa and Bong Counties) have two independents each; Bomi has three independents while Montserrado has Five Independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gbapolu County has no independent Candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of candidates also shows that there are twenty female candidates in the senatorial Race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nimba, Lofa, Grand Kru, Grand Gedeh and Bong Counties have 1 female candidate each while Margibi, Cape Mount and Gbapolu Counties have two female candidates each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bomi, Montserrado and River Cess Counties have Three Female candidates each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no female candidates in Grand Bassa, Maryland, River Gee and Sinoe Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, registered political Parties, Independent candidates, youths and student groups have consented to a suggestion that the Special Senatorial Election be held on December 16, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggested date was recommended by the National Elections Commission at separate meetings held with them on Friday at the headquarters of the Commission (NEC) in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political parties, candidates, youths and student groups have also recommended flexibility in conducting the Special Senatorial Election in the event there is an upsurge in the Ebola situation during the period up to December 20, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakeholders recommended that should this occur, the election should be conducted in counties that report lower risks of Ebola and that election in those counties still reporting high infection levels of the virus be suspended. Under this condition, partial election will ensure there is quorum in the Senate to conduct normal business, while the legal framework would be adopted to conduct election in the affected counties as the Ebola case level reduces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, members of the Press Union of Liberia have expressed mixed views on the conduct of the election on the suggested date of December 16, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members of the Press Union believe that a national conference should be held to discuss whether or not to hold the Special Senatorial Election while tackling the Ebola Virus disease. Other members suggested the election be held with safety measures put in place, while others argued there should be no election until the Ebola Virus is eradicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultations are aimed at finding a suitable date for the holding of the Special Senatorial Election in the wake of a Joint Resolution recently adopted by the National Legislature and to seek flexibility for the Special Election to be conducted in counties where the prevalence of Ebola is minimum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Joint Resolution adopted by the Legislature on October 10, 2014 mandates the National Elections Commission to conduct the Special Senatorial Election no later than December 20 this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a request from members of the House of Representatives to provide them update on the number of donations coming to Liberia relative to the fight against Ebola, Minister Ngafuan told the lawmakers that as a result of frantic international engagements, the Liberian Government, has attracted numerous global assistance in the country's bid to fight the virus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the direct assistance attracted through the Foreign Ministry, the country's chief diplomat informed members of the 53rd Lower House that the Ministry has been engaging its Embassies and Missions and friendly Governments across the world as a way of buttressing efforts of the Presidency in mobilizing international support to help battle against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the lawmakers on Thursday, October 16, 2014 on Capitol Hill, Minister Ngafuan indicated that the efforts of the Presidency and the Foreign Ministry with other Ministries and Agencies have translated into huge support coming in to help deal with the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Ngafuan enumerated regional contributions in the fight against Ebola and acknowledged the contributions of Europe through European Union and member states, Asian countries, the Americas and the African countries and African Union.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">634 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE OUTBREAK OF the Ebola virus on the nation which has claimed the lives of many persons has indeed weakened the fragile healthy sector of the country, imposing on its limited capacity and resources to curtail the spread of the virus and also catering to the many persons who seek treatment at various health centers. Since the outbreak which has also affected health workers, many main medical centers have ceased to operate or reduced the number of services to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE from the international community, including some countries, as well as multilateral and bilateral groups, the World Bank and the World Health Organization, the country has been able to make strive in curtailing the spread of the virus, by establishing many centers and also by improving the response methods.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUST LAST WEEK, it was reported that Africa's richest man, billionaire Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has expressed his preparedness to assist Liberia in the fight against the Ebola virus disease. According to an Executive Mansion release, in a telephone conversation with President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf on Friday, October 17, Alhaji Dangote volunteered to assist the country with medical personnel and other human and material resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FURTHERMORE, HE PROMISED that the Dangote Foundation will work with the Liberian leader's office to determine what assistance can be provided ranging from medical personnel as well as other professional healthcare workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR HER PART, President Sirleaf thanked Alhaji Dangote for the promised assistance and praised the Nigerian businessman for reaching out to the government and people of Liberia noting that this assistance will go a long way to help rebuild the country's healthcare system with highly skilled medical doctors and healthcare personnel during this critical period and beyond the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DESPITE THE CONCERNS by these countries, groups and individuals to assisting this country fight the Ebola virus, there are still needs to help restore the country's health sector to its pre-Ebola period. The situation is such that because of the Ebola outbreak, coupled with the lack of facilities, many persons, said to be suffering other illness, are turned back by health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS WHY we are happy that President Sirleaf has renewed her pleas to the world to continue to help fight the virus. This, we believe, would continue to send the message for more assistance as the country fight this deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN HER COMMUNICATION to the world, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is again pleading to countries around the world to join the fight against the Ebola virus disease and stressed that this is a fight in which the whole world has a stake. She stated further that this disease respects no borders. She said, &quot;The damage is seen in West Africa, whether in public health, the economy or within communities, is already reverberating throughout the region and across the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY, WE TAKE specific interest in the helping to assist health facilities in the country to be capacitated to cater to the many health needs of citizens. It is disheartening to note that because of the fragile state of the country's health sector, citizens have been turned back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THANKFULLY, WHILE APPRECIATING the many help being given to combat this virus in this country, we urge the government and its partners to also consider the plights of the medical facilities, which are not catering to Ebola cases, to begin to treat people with non-Ebola-related illnesses. The situation of the country's health facilities is very serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONSIDERING THE SERIOUSNESS of the situation, we urge our government and its partners to ensure that something be done to reverse this negative trend that is said to be contributing to the number of death tolls during this crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to eradicate the deadly Ebola Virus Disease are increasing daily and interestingly, most well-meaning Liberians are not only sitting supinely awaiting the International Community do everything in eliminating the killer Virus, but instead, they are collaboratively stepping up efforts aimed at aiding their compatriots stricken by the lethal disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So was the case on Saturday, October 18, 2014 when the National Staff Association (NASA) of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the Foundation for Aiding Children's Empowerment (FACE) donated a consignment of assorted food, clothing, disinfectants and other anti-Ebola materials to the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Memorial and the ELWA Hospital Ebola treatment Units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation which is valued at over two thousand US Dollars (2.000) was made possible through the voluntary contributions of ten US Dollars (10.00) by few Liberian and some foreign UNMIL staff and the leadership of the Foundation for Aiding Children's Empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation was in direct response to a request made by the JFK and ELWA Ebola Treatment Units to the public of needed items recently. The consignment included 20 bags of rice, several cartoons of bath and laundry soup, four (4) bales of used clothes and several sachets of bottled Aqua Life mineral water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation at JFK, the head of FACE and acting head of the UNMIL National Staff Association (NASA) Mr. Momolu J. Johnson, Sr. said, both organizations moved by the plight of those affected by the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her part, the supervisor of the JFK Ebola treatment Unit miss Patience P. Tokpah thanked Mr. Johnson and his organizations for the donation and assured that it will be used for the purposed intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also encourage all well-meaning Liberians and foreigners to emulate the fine example of FACE and NASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the second consignment at the ELWA Treatment Unit, expressing gladness at responding to the needs of the Ebola Victims. Receiving the donation, the head of the ELWA Ebola treatment Unit Dr. Nathaniel Dovillie expression profound appreciation about the initiative that led to the donation and thanked the public in general for responding to the needs of the center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foundation for Aiding Children's Empowerment is a self-help local rights advocacy group founded by in late 2010 by Mr. Momolu J. Jonson, Sr. and his wife Brownetta Luke Johnson in order to empower women and children, raise awareness about the danger of rape, sexual exploitation and abuse, child trafficking, HIV/Aids domestic violence child labor and other vices that negatively affect the growth and development of women and children in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dangote is ranked by Forbes Magazine as the 43rd richest person in the world, and the richest man in Africa. President Sirleaf Pleads to Countries Worldwide to Join the Fight against the Ebola Virus Disease</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is again pleading to countries around the world to join the fight against the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a fight in which the whole world has a stake,&quot; the Liberian leader cautioned; adding that this disease respects no borders. &quot;The damage it is causing in West Africa, whether in public health, the economy or within communities - is already reverberating throughout the region and across the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, President Sirleaf made the assertion in a &quot;Letter to the World&quot; aired on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) world news on Sunday, October 19, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned that Ebola which has taken hold in three fragile states - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-it is the duty of all, as global citizens, to send a message that they will not leave millions of West Africans to fend for themselves against an enemy that they do not know, and against whom they have little defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader urged governments, international organizations, financial institutions, non-governmental organizations, politicians and ordinary people on the street or in any corner of the world, that all have a stake in the battle against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time for talking or theorizing is over. Only concerted action will save my country, and our neighbors, from experiencing another national tragedy,&quot; the Liberian leader urged, quoting the words of Henrik Ibsen that &quot;A thousand words leave not the same deep impression as does a single deed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She indicated that initially the international reaction to this crisis was inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency. Now, she said, the world has woken up. &quot;The community of nations has realized they cannot simply pull up the drawbridge and wish this situation away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf reiterated that the fight against the Ebola virus disease requires a commitment from every nation that has the capacity to help - whether that is with emergency funds, medical supplies or clinical expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking about the devastation that the Ebola virus disease has done to Liberia in particular, President Sirleaf said in just six months, the virus disease has brought the country to a standstill. &quot;The virus has been able to spread so rapidly because of the insufficient strength of the emergency, medical and military services that remain under-resourced and without the preparedness to confront such a challenge,&quot; she stressed, noting that this would have been the case whether the confrontation was with another infectious disease, or a natural disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian President indicated that over 2,000 Liberians have died, some who are children struck down in the prime of their youth, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters or best friends, including many brave health workers that risked their lives to save others, or simply offer victims comfort in their final moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, President Sirleaf stressed that Liberians are a resilient people and as such, have the capacity as global citizens to face down this disease, beat it and rebuild. &quot;History has shown that when a people are at their darkest hour humanity has an enviable ability to act with bravery, compassion and selflessness for the benefit of those most in need,&quot; she pointed out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who likes a political leader to wield excessive power in contemporary times? The few who do would highly say or admit it openly. Even in Liberia, which has a long history of tyranny, one would hardly find many cowing to despotic tendencies, perhaps except within the current Ministry of Information where there were officials heard lambasting lawmakers, terming them &quot;fake&quot;, for fiercely denouncing and rejecting President Sirleaf's request to the National Legislature to grant her additional extra-constitutional powers to exercise during the reining state of emergency. Even the Liberty Party, which some time ago was branded by some critics as &quot;regime collaborator&quot;, is speaking different political language right now. It has been heaping praises on the National Legislature for rejecting the President's request, The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Liberia's foremost opposition political parties is commending the House of Representatives for its unanimous rejection of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request to the National Legislature for additional emergency powers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement signed by its Assistant Secretary General for Press and Propaganda, Edward Toomey, the Liberty Party said it was in full agreement with Liberian National Legislature and many other &quot;compatriots whose swift opposition to the President's attempt to unnecessarily curtail the basic rights guaranteed by our constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our hope that the entire National Legislature will be even more vigilant during these difficult times to prevent our fledgling democracy from being compromised by failure of leadership,&quot; the Liberty stressed. &quot;Liberty Party presents its compliments and congratulates the Honorable Members of the House of Representatives, under the leadership of Speaker Hon. Alex Tyler and Deputy Speaker Hon. Hans Barchue for rejecting President Sirleaf's request for sweeping emergency powers during this difficult time of our national existence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party also congratulated its legislative members J. Byron Brown, Representative for Grand Bassa County who made the motion to reject the President's request for extra-ordinary powers and the suspension of critical constitutional rights of Liberians and residents at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This great decision of the Lower House of the Liberian National Legislature was a vote in favor of democracy, which highlights the diligent work and collective effort of members of The House of Representatives,&quot; the Party said. &quot;This may well go down in history as one of the finest moments in the struggle for democratic governance in Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf early this month requested the National Legislature to approve the exercise of excessive powers under the state of emergency declared in August purportedly to hasten her administration's inhibiting of fast-spreading Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request had provoked outrage and debate in the public, especially in the National Legislature which later took a unanimous vote to reject the President's plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in full agreement with the House's decision to reject the President's request for many reasons, including that the additional powers requested do not seem to align with a transparent approach to stopping the spread of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD),&quot; the party said, adding: &quot;The President has not explained to Liberians the value added and reported results achieved from the initial authority granted her pursuant to the State of Emergency against the spread of EVD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Liberty Party the President's &quot;approaches contradict successful approaches employed in other places to fight Ebola that emphasize engagement of community and opinion leaders&quot; and that the measures being suggested by the President also contradict the views of epidemiologists and disease control and prevention experts who suggest that awareness and consistent messaging from trusted individuals in society are the most effective approaches to influencing public opinion and behavior changes needed to stop the spread of EVD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Outside government circle, the fight against EVD needs a credible and respected national voice in the spirit of the late Chief Tamba Taylor, to work alongside similar singular credible voices in each local community and region,&quot; the party indicated. &quot;Liberty Party continues to call on the government to reach out to community opinion leaders, including young men and women who reside in those communities and local groups, and connect them to the resources and training needed for an effective fight against the EVD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party said despite its repeated admonitions that the health care system in Liberia was deplorable, &quot;the President and her supporters, as well as critics of rational opposition, remained adamant that our comments were political and that Liberia was being developed under the current political leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thank the Honorable House of Representatives of the Liberian National Legislature and our many compatriots whose swift opposition to the President's attempt to unnecessarily curtail the basic rights guaranteed by our constitution,&quot; said the Liberty Party, which also expressed the hope that the entire National Legislature will be even more vigilant &quot;during these difficult times to prevent our fledgling democracy from being compromised by failure of leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 12 this year, President Ellen John Sirleaf wrote a highly compassion-provoking letter to the President of the United States, Barack Obama not only underscoring the paralysis of her government's response regime against threats posed by Ebola but also indicating that a whole generation could be wiped out if the United States did not act urgently. The tune of that letter portrayed a clear prostration on the part of Sirleaf before the US presidency that many nearly mistaken the move for the subjugation of Liberian sovereign clout to its former colonizer, some call it quasi colonizer. Whatever they called it, the response to President Sirleaf's letter came almost immediately. The United States has dispatched 3,000 of its armed forces to Liberian soil, perhaps the first in relations since the mid 20th Century. But the man who leads the United States of America and has promised a robust response against Ebola is not convinced that his country alone can meet the Ebola challenge. In recent days, he has been lamenting the international community's slow response. This must have prompted President Sirleaf, whose country is bearing half of the brunt of the Ebola menace in West Africa to again, this time, target the global community with her usual terse, sympathy-laden letter of plea for urgent, concerted intervention. The Analyst report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite enormous pledges and outpour of national and international supports in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus, predictions by experts continue to be grim and ominous. The Americans who promised to have up to 4,000 in the fight are so far concentrating on building Ebola treatment centers which are not expected to be complete and functional until November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the fatality figure is rising and nervously continues to grow amongst the population and particularly within Government. This might have pushed President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to writing yet another urgency-seeking communication in the space of two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first was sent to President Barack Obama of the United States. In that communication, President Sirleaf to Obama, &quot;the outbreak has overwhelmed the containment and treatment measures we have attempted thus far. Our already limited resources have been stretched to breaking point... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Sirleaf told Obama: &quot;Without more direct help from your government, we will lose this battle against Ebola. A WHO investigation conducted with other partners and our own Ministry of Health and Social Welfare projects thousands of cases over the next three weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of that letter, President Sireleaf said, &quot;The virus spreading at an exponential rate and we have a limited time window to arrest it. Mr. President, well over 40% of total cases occurred in the last 18 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps or perhaps not, the Americans have come. While they are still building Ebola treatment centers set to end in November nearly a two month earlier, President Obama is expressing dissatisfaction over international response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US president Barack Obama has condemned the international community for failing to do enough to counter the global Ebola threat, saying further 'the world is not doing enough' to counter the threat posed by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the US president indicating the indispensability of concerted global response to the fight against Ebola, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has thrown our appeal for urgent assistance beyond the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter addressed to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), President Sirleaf said This fight against requires a commitment from every nation that has the capacity to help - whether that is with emergency funds, medical supplies or clinical expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In just over six months, Ebola has managed to bring my country to a standstill,&quot; the Liberian head of state lamented: &quot;We have lost over 2,000 Liberians. Some are children struck down in the prime of their youth. Some were fathers, mothers, brothers or best friends. Many were brave health workers that risked their lives to save others, or simply offer victims comfort in their final moments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote that &quot;Ebola threatens to erase that hard work&quot; Liberia has put in recovering from 16 years of destructive civil conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf wrote: &quot;Our economy was set to be larger and stronger this year, offering more jobs to Liberians and raising living standards. Ebola is not just a health crisis - across West Africa, a generation of young people risk being lost to an economic catastrophe as harvests are missed, markets are shut and borders are closed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the &quot;virus has been able to spread so rapidly because of the insufficient strength of the emergency, medical and military services that remain under-resourced and without the preparedness to confront such a challenge. This would have been the case whether the confrontation was with Ebola, another infectious disease, or a natural disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one thing is clear. This is a fight in which the whole world has a stake,&quot; she insisted. &quot;This disease respects no borders. The damage it is causing in West Africa, whether in public health, the economy or within communities - is already reverberating throughout the region and across the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian President wrote in the letter that it is no coincidence that Ebola has taken hold in three fragile states - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - all battling to overcome the effects of interconnected wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote further: &quot;In Liberia, our civil war ended only eleven years ago. It destroyed our public infrastructure, crushed our economy and led to an exodus of educated professionals. A country that had some 3,000 qualified doctors at the start of the war was dependent by its end on barely three dozen. In the last few years, Liberia was bouncing back. We realized there was a long way to go, but the future was looking bright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international reaction to this crisis was initially inconsistent and lacking in clear direction or urgency,&quot; President Sirleaf said. &quot;Now finally, the world has woken up. The community of nations has realized they cannot simply pull up the drawbridge and wish this situation away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She however took solace in faith and &quot;in our resilience as Liberians, and our capacity as global citizens, to face down this disease, beat it and rebuild.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History has shown that when a people are at their darkest hour, humanity has an enviable ability to act with bravery, compassion and selflessness for the benefit of those most in need,&quot; the President said, noting further: &quot;From governments to international organisations, financial institutions to NGOs, politicians to ordinary people on the street in any corner of the world, we all have a stake in the battle against Ebola. It is the duty of all of us, as global citizens, to send a message that we will not leave millions of West Africans to fend for themselves against an enemy that they do not know, and against whom they have little defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time for talking or theorizing is over,&quot; she said. &quot;Only concerted action will save my country, and our neighbours, from experiencing another national tragedy. The words of Henrik Ibsen have never been truer: 'A thousand words leave not the same deep impression as does a single deed.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the massive outpour of material and human contributions from national and international sources, the Ebola Virus Disease is widely believed to be winning. In fact experts say it is they expect fatality of 10,000 every week in the next weeks in addition to the heartbreaking 1.4m infections in December and January. But with no proven clinical prove of cure, these predictions and actual infections are gloomier than what is likely to happen in this country. The desperately needed solution is ultimately Ebola's cure, which many pharmaceutical companies would not be ready as urgently and desperately needed on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, what appears to be the much-desired relief has arrived; courtesy of the group, &quot;Friends of Liberia in the Caribbean and Spain.&quot; The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been announced that an experimental drug to cure Ebola has arrived in the country. The Medicine, produced by a group of scientists from the laboratories of the Eurof&aacute;rmacos Group Europa based in Spain, sent the new antiviral treatment to Liberia, named &quot;EBOFLIP&quot;, to start an immediate clinical trial on patients infected with the EBOLA virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pronouncement is made by the Friends of Liberia in the Caribbean and Spain, led by Ambassador Rafael Martinez, which has again donated a second consignment of assorted Medicine to Liberia, to assist with the fight of the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the second donation at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare this week, on behalf of Eurofarmacos Group, Liberia's former Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Ambassador Wesley Momo Johnson, said the drugs represent a form of treatment that is effective for viral infection in immune-competent and immune-compromised patients with Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers such as Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amb. Johnson is now the Chief Executive Officer of Access Liberia Incorporated, a Liberian-owned consultant firm which represents the company in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a press release quotes Dr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Frias, President of Eurof&aacute;rmacos Group Europa that the manufacturer of EBOFLIP saying, &quot;We have no doubt that within the next few weeks Liberia should able to affirm the results of the clinical trial of the drugs, and that they will prove consistent enough to ensure the ultimate control of the pandemic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the release the Eurof&aacute;rmacos Group Europa already has 30,000 treatments in stock awaiting distribution and has the ability to produce up to 500,000 treatments per month if required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also states that EBOFLIP, unlike other products being trialed at present, is not only effective at stopping the development of the disease, but also provides excellent immunity against contracting Ebola, without having to create a live vaccine solution for the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is particularly important in immunizing those at high-risk of exposure to the virus such as close family, treating doctors and medical staff,&quot; the group said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accepting the donation of drugs on behalf of the Government of Liberia, Dr. Bernice Dahn, Deputy Minister for Health Services and Chief Medical Officer at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, thanked Ambassador Johnson for the assistance to Liberia and asked him to convey to Ambassador Rafael Martinez and the Friends of Liberia in the Caribbean and Spain, especially the laboratories of Eurof&aacute;rmacos Group Europa S.L., that the Liberian people are extremely grateful for the donation, which has come at a critical time, when the country and its people are grappling with the Ebola Virus which is ravaging the lives of hundreds of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went on to praise the Eurofarmacos Group for the donation and promised to provide the Ebola Treatment Unit with the drug to ensure that it is clinically tested; in keeping with acceptable standards and that the results would be conveyed to the Lab accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian public sector workforce had its first shock when the administration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was in its infancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Sirleaf and her principal duties, arriving at the national leadership realm coming from their private sector backgrounds, wanted the politics-made bloated public bureaucracy disemboweled to a &quot;small and efficient&quot; government. And despite the emergent administration's &quot;papa na come&quot; slogan, they severed hundreds if not thousands of &quot;non-essential&quot; employees under its downsizing and rightsizing policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Government ages to its expiry soon, after ironically helping to further bloat the public service, it is contemplating revisiting the policy of its adolescence--retrenching more civil servants. But, as The Analyst reports, the 53rd National Legislature is not inclined to let that happen under its watch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director General of the Civil Service Agency (CSA), George Werner, has confirmed that proposals are under consideration to redundant about 30,000 civil servants considered non-essential staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the redundant employees will be paid two years instantly, get retraining and those with enhanced skills after the two years will be re-employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Information had earlier refuted reports that the Government was retrenching &quot;non-essential&quot; employees who are serving a stay-home order imposed by the government as a measure to avert the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When while appearing before the Liberian Senate, Werner said: &quot;The essence of this proposal is to redundant surplus government employees who are not working in context and reduce the institutionalization of poverty that has reduced government employees to mere beggars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July the government declared a number of civil servants non-essential staff and asked them to stay home and be paid their full salaries and benefits as part of measures to decongest public offices in the wake of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it emerged that plans were afoot to redundant the non-essential staff, the Liberian Senate cited the CSA Director General to clarify reports of plans. LINA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Objects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been strong opposition to the CSA's and by extension Government's move. Last Thursday the Liberian Senate voted unanimously to discourage and prevent the severing of 30,000 employees from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers told the CSA director who was appearing before them that Liberian Constitution which guarantees citizens' right for work and employment regardless of sex, creed, and religion, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communicating the decision to CSA director George Werner, the lawmakers it would be a disservice to ordinary employees of Government who have suffered unbearable hardship. Some of the lawmakers instructed Werner and the CSA to abandon the mass retrenchment of public workers to avoid citizens' mass action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They further argued that as servants of the people, issues that relate to their happiness and their well-being will not be &quot;swept under the carpet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every senate given the chance to speak on the matter expressed opposition and rejection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the Senate has ordered the Director General of the CSA to pay to government's revenue a fine of L$4,999 and report a flag receipt to the body within 24 hours for branding the lawmakers &quot;irrational&quot;, a charge he denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSA boss was ordered to publish an apology letter in seven local dailies for the &quot;insult to the entire plenary and ordinary Liberians who have been expressing their dissatisfaction about the planned redundancy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a new message contained in a newly produced anti-Ebola song, all five electoral districts in Grand Bassa County were touched with the distribution of assorted food items and drugs by a non-political association of a Bassa group who led the county's first Ebola humanitarian mission that comprised of members of the county's legislative caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by Honorables Levi Demmah, T. Nelson Williams and Lynch George-Cassell (all three prominent Bassonians), the Bassa Belt Association over the weekend began its initial step in aiding the citizens and residents of Grand Bassa County in an humanitarian mission that began in Compound One and ended in the port city of Buchanan amidst cheers and a deep sense of appreciation from the citizens despite the improtu-nature of the visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Farmington River to the county capital, the group was eventually joined by all five political representatives and or their proxies and the Senior Senator of the county as the Junior Senator who heads the Legislative Caucus sent her representative due to travel engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As citizens of Bassa, under the banner Bassa Belt we have come together to fight Ebola. We believe that in all times, whether in good or bad times, we must mobilize ourselves to help our people&quot;, remarked Hon. Demmah, adding, &quot;In this group, we have no politics in our midst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so we are well pleased that we the people of Grand Bassa County, while the Government is contemplating on bigger issues, will be contemplating on other issues that can support clinics and people that are at the various hospitals in terms of providing some food stuffs and drugs intended to strengthen them because we now know that not only people are being turned away from some hospitals and that drugs are insufficient in some of the clinics in the various districts. So, if we do what we can do collectively as people of Grand Bassa, we will be supporting the fight against Ebola&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on contributors, he noted that sons and daughters of Grand Bassa County from all walks of life contributed to the initial steps, committing to do more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following distributions at various points for Electoral Districts One and Two received by their respective representatives in the persons of Hon. Hans Barchue and a proxy for Hon. Mary Karwah, the convoy continued unto the port city of Buchanan where Electoral Districts Three, Four and Five were represented by their respective representatives in Honorables Byron Brown, Robertson Siaway and Gabriel Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In separate remarks, all the county's political leaders including Pro Temp Gbezohngar Findley all hailed the group's initiatives and cautioned the citizens of the county to abide by the new message of 'accepting no stranger and visitor' and 'early reporting at treatment centers' to enhance chances of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hon. T Nelson Williams termed as a good initiative the move by the group to provide services and medical supplies to the people of Grand Bassa County. He then expressed confidence that the initiative will serve more of a unifier: &quot;That's our prayer, that's our hope and we will do everything possible to ensure that we have longevity so we can all work together in the interest of our country and county. Today we see unification, we see unity amongst the leadership of Bassa which is a good thing.&quot; He continued, &quot;I think now than ever before, the people of Bassa will like to see a unified Caucus. So we have come with one voice to say that Ebola must be dismissed and eradicated from our county and from our country.&quot; Superintendent Etweda Cooper, on behalf of the county's administrative leadership, thanked the group for its initiatives for coming together to &quot;add in the fight against Ebola&quot; and for &quot;setting examples which is important to see that each of us is active in fighting Ebola&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upgrading the message of &quot;Don't accept strangers and visitors&quot;, the Superintendent added, &quot;I will also add don't just accept strangers but also don't go and be strangers to somebody else's because many of us have gone and collected Ebola and brought it to Grand Bassa County&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She stressed the need for a continuity in the fight despite the decrease in Ebola suspected, probable and confirmed cased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Cooper hoped for an Ebola-free Christmas holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sundaygar Dearboy song made in the Bassa dialect preaching messages of early reporting which encouraged his kinsmen to call 4455 and accept no strangers or visitors was also presented to the county leadership for wide dissemination to the various radio stations in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributors to the initial step came from Senator Findley, LPRC Managing Director T. Nelson Williams, II. , Gender Minister Julia Duncan-Cassell, Deputy Commissioner Dekontee Sackie-King, Deputy Transport Minister Levi Demmah, Assistant Information Minister Lynch George-Cassell, Cllr. TC Gould, Tomar Johnson of the Gender Minister, Abraham Copper of Ecobank, Madagline Dagoseh, among others with commitments from the rest of the members of the county legislative caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists Nat Bayjay and Abraham Wheon, also two prominent sons of the county who are always engaged with major activities of Grand Bassa, also contributed their expertise towards the initiatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Sir Nick Carter is leading a review of the UK's response to the virus, and could use 3,000 British soldiers to impose a blockade and restrict human movement in the African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Nick, the Chief of the General Staff, will advise Ministers on proposals, including an increase in troop numbers and using Royal Navy ships to patrol its coastal waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top-level review comes as charity Oxfam said a critical shortfall of Western military personnel in West Africa was in danger of putting lives at risk. It wants troops to deliver vital supplies and build treatment centres for victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But defence sources disclosed last night that options to be considered by Sir Nick go much further and include UK troops deploying to towns and villages deep inside Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source said: From a military perspective ebola is like a biological warfare attack and should be countered accordingly. There needs to be a clampdown on human movement inside Sierra Leone and possibly to and from the country between now and late 2015 when it is hoped that an antidote will have been developed.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Nick, who led thousands of UK troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, is expected to deliver recommendations by the end of this week. Currently 750 British military personnel are committed to stamping out ebola. The UK has also sent a hospital ship and three helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak began more than 4,500 people have died from the disease. Experts fear the death toll could rise to a million by July next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a further move, the Government's health watchdog Public Health England last night released specific advice for pregnant women concerned about contracting ebola, saying research suggested there is limited evidence' they are at increased risk of severe illness, medical complications and death when infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: Reported complications include spontaneous abortion and pregnancy-associated haemorrhage. Infants born to mothers who are in the terminal stage of disease are invariably infected.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the number of specialist beds available in the UK for ebola victims has been reduced following a legal row over building work at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is withholding payments to the building company Laing O'Rourke Construction after claims that work on a &pound;330?million rebuilding project there is not up to standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Leonard Fenwick, the trust's chief executive, said: It means we can't move to the next stage and build the centre for infectious diseases.' Laing O'Rourke declined to comment due to legal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said the virus was the biggest health problem for a generation' - and that not all states were doing enough.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has written to Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, to say ebola should be placed on the agenda of next week's Brussels summit. Mr Cameron said the one billion euros - &pound;800million - would pay for 2,000 extra health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the EU has raised less than half that sum to tackle ebola. Britain has already pledged &pound;125million, second only to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cameron brought up the need for a stronger response at the Asia-Europe Meeting of world leaders in Milan yesterday. Meanwhile, Public Health England said ebola screening is to be introduced at Manchester and Birmingham airports, on top of existing measures at Heathrow, Gatwick and London's Eurostar terminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions about the programme were raised after a Downing Street spokesman revealed only five people were screened on Tuesday - the first day of the initiative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel Pellegrini has insisted Yaya Tour&eacute; and Serbian pair Matija Nastasic and Aleksandar Kolarov are ready to face Tottenham for Manchester City today after returning from a troubled week of international football.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tour&eacute; flew back to Manchester on Thursday, a day earlier than originally planned, after playing in Ivory Coast's 4-3 defeat at home to DR Congo on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serbia defenders Nastasic and Kolarov endured the abandonment of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Albania in Belgrade on Tuesday as a result of pitch battles after a drone carrying an Albanian flag was flown into the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the international crisis surrounding the Ebola virus escalating in west Africa this week, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew admitted that the club were taking precautions to monitor the club's African players Cheick Tiot&eacute; and Papiss Ciss&eacute;. But Pellegrini insisted that Tour&eacute; remained unconcerned by the prospect of travelling to and from Africa, despite the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No, really we are not concerned about it,&quot; Pellegrini said. &quot;Yaya is not concerned either. I suppose he is sure about that problem and I don't think he will have any problems. I don't know if he was screened, but for the moment he is OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kolarov and Nastasic, meanwhile, have both been named in the squad to face Spurs after being on the pitch during the outbreak of trouble against Albania. Uefa is investigating the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have both come back on Thursday,&quot; Pellegrini said. &quot;Of course it was not a good experience for them. We will see what happens in the future. But it was a very bad thing for football. In both a political sense and football sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, City are set to prepare for next month's derby against Manchester United by sleeping at the club's new &pound;200million training ground the night before the game. The City Football Academy is located on the Etihad Campus next to the club's Etihad Stadium. The first-team building, as well as housing changing rooms, a gym, refectory and cutting-edge medical centre, also has hotel-style rooms for each member of Pellegrini's squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The first team will be able to stay there on the night before a home game, instead of going to a hotel,&quot; said Patrick Vieira, City's reserve team manager. &quot;It is much more professional.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON A BUOYANT day for the wider market, Carnival was rocked by an Ebola scare on one of its cruise ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares in the FTSE 100 company tumbled as much as 4.6pc as traders reacted to news that an American health worker travelling on the Carnival Magic vessel had been placed in isolation aboard the ship. The individual is a lab worker at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and may have come into contact with specimens collected from a now deceased Liberian patient. Although the individual has shown no signs of the deadly virus, the vessel, which was bound for the Caribbean, is now en route back to Texas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Travel-related stocks, including Carnival, have slumped in recent weeks on fears that the spread of Ebola beyond West Africa could stunt demand to travel. But despite slumping on yesterday's news, Carnival shares, which also trade in New York, recovered to close up 20p, or 0.9pc, at &pound;22.14 in London. Greg Johnson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said he was not surprised by the rebound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wider market rally would have buoyed Carnival, and a survey showing US consumer sentiment was at its highest level since July 2007 would have given the stock an additional boost, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FTSE 100, shaken in recent days by a surge of volatility, enjoyed a brisk rally. Unlike Thursday, when the index swung violently between a strong rise and a heavy loss, the FTSE 100 managed to improve on early gains to close up 114.38 points at 6,310.29, a 1.9pc rise that was its biggest since July last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A rally in oil stocks, on the back of a rise in crude prices, also helped to pull the London market higher. Tullow Oil jumped 40.1p to 524p and Ophir Energy advanced 12.3p to 194.4p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An upgrade to &quot;buy&quot; at Societe Generale gave an extra boost to Tullow. Analysts at the broker said: &quot;Tullow Oil's share price has collapsed 44pc in the year to date due to the triple whammy of falling oil prices, mixed drilling results and concerns over a lack of progress with its asset disposal strategy.&quot; However, the group's &quot;financials remain strong&quot;, and its &quot;size and balance sheet strength should ... allow it to ride out the current lower oil price environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A well-received trading update from Petrofac, in which the oilfield services group stuck with its full-year profit guidance, lifted the shares 72&frac12;p higher to &pound;10.60. Liberum analysts said the &quot;market generally expected Petrofac to miss this year's guidance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Royal Mail was another FTSE 100 riser, gaining 19.1p to 431.7p after heavyweight broker Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to &quot;equal weight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rolls-Royce was the bluechip laggard, slumping 108&frac12;p, or 11.5pc, to 832p following a fresh profit warning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Fraser Nelson (&quot;Ebola may be gruesome but it's not the biggest threat to Africa&quot;, October 17) states that poverty is the root cause of Africa's problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the main reasons for this poverty is the continent's rapidly increasing population, which continues to outstrip its ability to feed itself. The population in Nigeria has increased by 300 per cent in the last 40 years: that in Ethiopia by 380 per cent. Even developed nations would find it almost impossible to cope with such burgeoning increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to reduce this poverty, resources must first be concentrated on stabilising the population growth by introducing contraception methods such as vasectomy. As harsh as it sounds, there seems little point in reducing child mortality if children are subsequently to starve. In tandem with birth control, the developed world must invest in agriculture and industry to enable Africans to feed and support themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such investment ought to be managed by donors as many African leaders are renowned for diverting aid money for their own use, particularly in procuring arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is time that the United Nations managed controlled change instead of just fighting fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tony Ellis Northwood, Middlesex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - As we now have to face the prospect of the global spread of infectious diseases such as Ebola, we must surely begin to pay even more attention to public hygiene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When one sees the disgusting state of many of our bank's hole-in-the-wall cash machines, I do wonder if we are overlooking a potential source of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should not banks and retailers be obliged by law to clean these devices regularly with a powerful disinfectant?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Mann Bideford, Devon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - There seems little point in border checks for potential Ebola victims if we proactively import infected patients who then, due to arguably foreseeable errors, infect their carers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus - its very name seems to have come straight from the heart of darkness - is striking fear across the globe. It has killed (officially) 4,546 people out of 9,191 infected since the first case in West Africa in December 2013, but it now poses a risk to millions. Yesterday, David Cameron, the Prime Minister, described it as the &quot;biggest health threat to the world in a generation&quot;. A politician's soundbite, or the stark reality?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Belgian scientist who co-discovered the virus is phlegmatic. Professor Peter Piot, now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says there is good news - and bad. Back in September 1976, he was a 27-yearold researcher at a microbiology laboratory in Antwerp when he identified the new pathogen. He discovered it in vials of blood taken from a Flemish missionary nun in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), who had died of a mysterious illness that was killing scores of people. Prof Piot flew out a few days later, part of a team who would track the virus to its source - fruit bats - in the rainforest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He saw the effects of the disease rampaging through a remote jungle community of Yambuku, and witnessed the agonising prelude to death, of fever, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhage. The worm-shaped virus, consisting of just seven genes, attacks the immune system and dissolves the body's blood vessels. Most people who are infected within a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Piot knew then that he was dealing with something new and unusual, but he had not yet realised it was a virus that had the potential to kill millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I could never, ever have imagined then that we would have a major epidemic from this virus,&quot; Prof Piot, now 65, says. &quot;In 38 years we had maybe 1,500 deaths - say 40 a year. That is not a public health crisis. I never thought it would come to the point that we see today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its terrifying nature, Ebola - named after a small river near the village where the nun died - is actually a poor candidate for the &quot;Apocalypse virus&quot; beloved of Hollywood epics. And Prof Piot insists that it is still impossible to predict how bad the African epidemic will become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says that he likes to &quot;put myself in the mind of the virus&quot;. And if you are an Ebola virus then &quot;we humans make a very, very bad host. You need to jump to another host in a week because your host is dead&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paradoxically, it is the very virulence of Ebola - it rapidly incapacitates its victims and kills between 50 and 70 per cent of them - that has meant all outbreaks predating this one have rapidly burnt themselves out. A virus wants its host to stay alive and mobile for as long as possible, so it can infect other people. With Ebola, once the symptoms start, you will not be going anywhere (one of the reasons that screening air passengers arriving in the UK may be pointless). Ebola is also hard to catch - it requires direct contact with bodily fluids, and you cannot infect others until you are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what has changed? Earlier outbreaks occurred in remote areas of the Congo, a vast, sparsely populated nation with few roads. Such places are a form of natural quarantine, says Prof Piot, and after killing a few dozen people - most often doctors and nurses, who are most likely to be exposed to infection - these outbreaks subsided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the current outbreak has taken root, are very different. More densely populated and urban, with better transport links, they have young, mobile populations who depend heavily on West Africa's vast fleet of shared taxis to get around (a major transmission risk, not least when they were used to transport infected corpses for burial).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even so, Prof Piot is convinced that the world could have brought the disease rapidly under control months ago if prompt action had been taken. The World Health Organisation reacted too late, he says, and by the time the seriousness of the outbreak was fully realised it was heading out of control. According to one estimate, it will cost around &pound;1 billion a month to build and staff the treatment centres needed to isolate a notional 100,000 patients, quarantine their contacts and prevent the disease from spreading. So far, despite vague pledges, the international community has given nothing like enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem with Ebola is that it is not over until the last patient is either dead or has recovered,&quot; Prof Piot says. &quot;Actually, I thought this outbreak was dying out in May, in Guinea. Then a famous woman, a traditional healer, died, and at her funeral hundreds of people touched the body. Then there was this explosion in three countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spread of Ebola is, of course, fuelled by the fact that the nations affected have no health systems to speak of (in 2010 there were only 51 doctors in the whole of Liberia) and that traditional funeral practices involve the touching and kissing of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Can it be stopped? It will be a bumpy ride. I am worried for West Africa. We will see a decline in cases eventually, but without a vaccine I am not sure we can stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several companies are fasttracking vaccines: two in particular, one being developed in Canada and one by GlaxoSmithKline in Britain, hold promise. But yesterday GSK said their vaccine would be &quot;too late&quot; for this outbreak and probably not available until late 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Healthcare workers are likely to be the first recipients, as it is Ebola's ability to strike the very people caring for victims that has contributed to the spread. &quot;Ebola has literally destroyed the health services in these countries,&quot; Prof Piot says. As a result, it is quite possible that more people have died as a result of the lack of treatment for other diseases, such as malaria, than of Ebola itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Piot admits to being &quot;very worried&quot; about Africa, but remains optimistic that Ebola will not be a major problem in the West. &quot;Even in Nigeria, when they had a small epidemic, it was quickly contained. The authorities acted promptly, including a non-negotiable quarantine. Also, in Congo, a recent outbreak was contained... and Congo is not the best-organised country in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he agrees that if the African outbreak continues to spread, it is inevitable that cases will occur elsewhere. &quot;If it does get to the UK, I am convinced that we can contain it.&quot; He is also dismissive of claims made by several scientists that the virus could become airborne, pointing to the Aids virus as an example: &quot;Even though it has had millions of passages through humans, HIV is still transmitted in the same way it always was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is more worried that Ebola will mutate into a less virulent strain (something that is more likely as it spreads through a larger population) - one that may only kill 30 per cent of those infected. &quot;That may well lead to more secondary cases [because more infected people will be mobile for longer].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no evidence that the virus is becoming more virulent and reports that the death rate have risen from 50 to 70 per cent are a result of insufficient data during the early days of the outbreak, Prof Piot insists. A strong public health message is being broadcast by local radio stations and there are signs that dangerous practices, such as open coffins at funerals, are on the wane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is some truth in the Prime Minister's assertion yesterday. Ebola has killed thousands of Africans and will kill tens of thousands more, possibly millions, before it is brought under control. It has the potential to destroy the economies of some of the poorest nations on Earth (Sierra Leone's nascent tourist industry is probably now dead) and spread to other continents where millions live in poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is hope, too, says Prof Piot. &quot;Change in behaviour has to come from within these communities, not from a bunch of white doctors telling people what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And we need to spend the money. A billion pounds a month sounds a lot, but it is eight times less than the world spends on video games. We can't afford not to defeat Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA screening will be extended to two more of Britain's major airports, it has been disclosed, as David Cameron warned the disease was &quot;the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers at Manchester and Birmingham Airports will be assessed for signs of the virus once the arrangements covering Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras have &quot;settled&quot;, the head of Public Health England said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Downing Street said that just five people travelling from affected countries in West Africa were screened for Ebola on Tuesday, the first day of checks for the illness, despite official estimates that 1,000 people a month would try to come to Britain from the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosures came amid mounting concern over the scale of international efforts to deal with the epidemic in West Africa, as Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank chief, warned that &quot;we are losing the battle&quot; because some countries were &quot;only worried about their own borders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leaked draft document yesterday showed that the World Health Organisation acknowledged that it botched attempts to stop the outbreak in West Africa, blaming factors including incompetent staff and a lack of information. The virus has already killed an estimated 4,555 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, UK cruise liners said they were taking the threat of deadly Ebola &quot;very seriously&quot; after a US health-care worker was quarantined on board a ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama separately appointed an Ebola &quot;tsar&quot; to manage the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some boarding schools in Britain are writing to parents to find out whether their children are going to areas hit by the outbreak, amid fears that they will return with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cameron called on fellow EU leaders to &quot;significantly step up&quot; their contribution to tackling the outbreak, suggesting other countries were failing to shoulder their share of the burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, had said he was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; at the scale and speed of the international response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are no direct flights to the UK from the three worst affected countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, Downing Street has said that passengers arriving via another destination on a single ticket were being &quot;required&quot; to undergo www.screening.No 10 estimated around 1,000 people a month will try to come to Britain from one of the affected countries via Brussels, Paris or Casablanca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: &quot;I can say that on Tuesday there were five people on a single ticket and all were screened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is putting &pound;125million towards fighting Ebola - the highest sum after the US. Yesterday, a video emerged of one of two nurses who caught the virus after treating a man who died of it in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting up in her hospital bed, a tearful Nina Pham told fellow nurses: &quot;I love you guys.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON A BUOYANT day for the wider market, Carnival was rocked by an Ebola scare on one of its cruise ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in the FTSE 100 company tumbled as much as 4.6pc as traders reacted to news that an American health worker travelling on the Carnival Magic vessel had been placed in isolation aboard the ship. The individual is a lab worker at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and may have come into contact with specimens collected from a now deceased Liberian patient. Although the individual has shown no signs of the deadly virus, the vessel, which was bound for the Caribbean, is now en route back to Texas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travel-related stocks, including Carnival, have slumped in recent weeks on fears that the spread of Ebola beyond West Africa could stunt demand to travel. But despite dropping on yesterday's news, Carnival shares, which also trade in New York, recovered to close up 20p, or 0.9pc, at &pound;22.14 in London. Greg Johnson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said he was not surprised by the rebound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wider market rally would have buoyed Carnival, and a survey showing US consumer sentiment was at its highest level since July 2007 would have given the stock an additional boost, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100, shaken in recent days by a surge of volatility, enjoyed a brisk revival. Unlike Thursday, when the index swung violently between a strong rise and a heavy loss, the FTSE 100 managed to improve on early gains to close up 114.38 points at 6,310.29, a 1.9pc rise that was its biggest since July last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rally in oil stocks, on the back of a rise in crude prices, also helped to pull the London market higher. Tullow Oil jumped 40.1p to 524p and Ophir Energy advanced 12.3p to 194.4p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An upgrade to &quot;buy&quot; at Societe Generale gave an extra boost to Tullow. Analysts at the broker said: &quot;Tullow Oil's share price has collapsed 44pc in the year to date due to the triple whammy of falling oil prices, mixed drilling results and concerns over a lack of progress with its asset disposal strategy.&quot; However, the group's &quot;financials remain strong&quot;, and its &quot;size and balance sheet strength should ... allow it to ride out the current lower oil price environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A well-received trading update from Petrofac, in which the oilfield services group stuck with its full-year profit guidance, lifted the shares 72&frac12;p higher to &pound;10.60. Liberum analysts said the &quot;market generally expected Petrofac to miss this year's guidance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail was another FTSE 100 riser, gaining 19.1p to 431.7p after heavyweight broker Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to &quot;equal weight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rolls-Royce was the bluechip laggard, slumping 108&frac12;p, or 11.5pc, to 832p following a fresh profit warning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he Ebola virus - its very name seems to have come straight from the heart of darkness - is striking fear across the globe. It has killed (officially) 4,546 people out of 9,191 infected since the first case in West Africa in December 2013, but it now poses a risk to millions. Yesterday, David Cameron, the Prime Minister, described it as the &quot;biggest health threat to the world in a generation&quot;. A politician's soundbite, or the stark reality? The Belgian scientist who co-discovered the virus is phlegmatic. Professor Peter Piot, now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says there is good news - and bad. Back in September 1976, he was a 27-yearold researcher at a microbiology laboratory in Antwerp when he identified the new pathogen. He discovered it in vials of blood taken from a Flemish missionary nun in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), who had died of a mysterious illness that was killing scores of people. Prof Piot flew out a few days later, part of a team who would track the virus to its source - fruit bats - in the rainforest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He saw the effects of the disease rampaging through a remote jungle community of Yambuku, and witnessed the agonising prelude to death, of fever, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhage. The worm-shaped virus, consisting of just seven genes, attacks the immune system and dissolves the body's blood vessels. Most people who are infected die within a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Piot knew then that he was dealing with something new and unusual, but he had not yet realised it was a virus that had the potential to kill millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could never, ever have imagined then that we would have a major epidemic from this virus,&quot; Prof Piot, now 65, says. &quot;In 38 years we had maybe 1,500 deaths - say 40 a year. That is not a public health crisis. I never thought it would come to the point that we see today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its terrifying nature, Ebola - named after a small river near the village where the nun died - is actually a poor candidate for the &quot;Apocalypse virus&quot; beloved of Hollywood epics. And Prof Piot insists that it is still impossible to predict how bad the African epidemic will become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that he likes to &quot;put myself in the mind of the virus&quot;. And if you are an Ebola virus then &quot;we humans make a very, very bad host. You need to jump to another host in a week because your host is dead&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, it is the very virulence of Ebola - it rapidly incapacitates its victims and kills between 50 and 70 per cent of them - that has meant all outbreaks predating this one have rapidly burnt themselves out. A virus wants its host to stay alive and mobile for as long as possible, so it can infect other people. With Ebola, once the symptoms start, you will not be going anywhere (one of the reasons that screening air passengers arriving in the UK may be pointless). Ebola is also hard to catch - it requires direct contact with bodily fluids, and you cannot infect others until you are symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what has changed? Earlier outbreaks occurred in remote areas of the Congo, a vast, sparsely populated nation with few roads. Such places are a form of natural quarantine, says Prof Piot, and after killing a few dozen people - most often doctors and nurses, who are most likely to be exposed to infection - these outbreaks subsided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the current outbreak has taken root, are very different. More densely populated and urban, with better transport links, they have young, mobile populations who depend heavily on West Africa's vast fleet of shared taxis to get around (a major transmission risk, not least when they were used to transport infected corpses for burial).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Prof Piot is convinced that the world could have brought the disease rapidly under control months ago if prompt action had been taken. The World Health Organisation reacted too late, he says, and by the time the seriousness of the outbreak was fully realised it was heading out of control. According to one estimate, it will cost around &pound;1 billion a month to build and staff the treatment centres needed to isolate a notional 100,000 patients, quarantine their contacts and prevent the disease from spreading. So far, despite vague pledges, the international community has given nothing like enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with Ebola is that it is not over until the last patient is either dead or has recovered,&quot; Prof Piot says. &quot;Actually, I thought this outbreak was dying out in May, in Guinea. Then a famous woman, a traditional healer, died, and at her funeral hundreds of people touched the body. Then there was this explosion in three countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of Ebola is, of course, fuelled by the fact that the nations affected have no health systems to speak of (in 2010 there were only 51 doctors in the whole of Liberia) and that traditional funeral practices involve the touching and kissing of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can it be stopped? It will be a bumpy ride. I am worried for West Africa. We will see a decline in cases eventually, but without a vaccine I am not sure we can stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several companies are fasttracking vaccines: two in particular, one being developed in Canada and one by GlaxoSmithKline in Britain, hold promise. But yesterday GSK said their vaccine would be &quot;too late&quot; for this outbreak and probably not available until late 2015.</SPAN></P>

The authorities acted promptly, including a non-negotiable quarantine. Also, in Congo, a recent outbreak was contained... and Congo is not the best-organised country in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are dark, unseen enemies, come from far away - and they are scaring us witless. Isis is not a disease, and Ebola is not a terror organisation. But fear is their common currency: intentional for one, inevitable for the other. Today they can seem to be working in tandem, a pincer movement paralysing the world's governments as it terrifies the world's people. Each time one advances, the space for the other expands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the vantage point of the west, the similarities are obvious. It starts with a menace that was once obscure and understood by few, with a name that keeps shifting (is it Isis, Isil or IS?) or a pronunciation that is uncertain (is it ee-boh-la or ebb-ola?), and which suddenly becomes all-pervasive, threatening catastrophe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, the turning point came when the victims were no longer distant others, but people deemed to be like us. So the Islamic State became impossible to ignore not when it conducted mass executions, on camera, of hundreds of Iraqi and Syrian fighters, but when it beheaded western hostages, men whose names sounded like our own: James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning. Ebola was an African problem until cases surfaced in places we could point to on a map: Madrid or Dallas. The Isis and Ebola stories are both captured by a simple Andre Carrilho cartoon showing a ward full of dying black people - with a cluster of TV cameras huddling around the lone white victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the greater similarity is the feeling of impotence that both crises prompt. The US, the most armed nation in the history of humankind, which spends more on weapons than the 10 next highest-spending nations combined - along with five European allies and partners from the Gulf states - is pounding Isis from the air and yet making only marginal progress. No one is talking of victory over Isis; most speak of merely containing it. Meanwhile, the same US, with all its state-of-the-art technology and germproof suits, couldn't prevent one of its nurses catching Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against that impotence rages the cry that something must be done. It loses little ardour when it is confronted with evidence that that something is likely to do no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, military strategists pointed out the obvious defects in a policy of air strikes against Isis. Surely its fighters would hide themselves and their (serious) military kit rather than remain exposed in plain sight. And if Isis did hide among civilians, then western attacks would end up killing innocents not militants, thereby creating sympathy, and recruits, for the jihadists. As for the British (and European) willingness to hit Isis in Iraq but not Syria, that surely was to insist on a border that had been erased by war. Isis operates in both countries, combining them into a single battlefield. Surely it was quaintly legalistic of America's allies to preserve a distinction that events had made defunct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The errors in the anti-Ebola strategy were just as obvious. &quot;Enhanced screening&quot; at British airports and Eurostar terminals carries the smack of firm, decisive action. But health experts coughed politely and noted that such screening would not pick up those whose symptoms were not yet visible, and would be no protection at all against those who lied about their movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experts further warned that a likely product of such measures would be increased anxiety, which might hinder - not help - the one action that really would make a difference: getting doctors and nurses to go to west Africa and combat Ebola on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not as if policymakers don't hear these warnings. They do. As chief of staff to Tony Blair during a decade in Downing Street, Jonathan Powell managed a fair few crises. He says of President Obama and Isis: &quot;He knows bombing has no chance. He wants to be the man who ends wars, not starts them. He's taking action he knows can't succeed. There's a logical dissonance there and it shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron is, no doubt, similarly conflicted, though for different reasons. He surely believes air strikes over Iraq but not Syria make little sense, but political reality - given parliament's veto of action against Syria last year - means he can act in one area but not the other. On both Isis and Ebola politicians are aware of the limits on their capabilities, yet have to make a show of mastery and control. Yesterday, Obama appointed an Ebola tsar, a title that suggests a contagious disease can be instructed to recede by imperial fiat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the biggest problem might also be the most prosaic. It is simply that these two big crises have struck at once. In 1999, during the Kosovo war, I asked a White House official about progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He confessed to me that even the White House - regularly imagined by Hollywood as the throbbing heart of power, bursting with might - could only cope with one major international issue at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell puts the capacity a little higher than that, recalling his own &quot;rule of six&quot;, by which he could cope with six problems - small, medium or large - at once, but no more. He pictured himself running between spinning plates. If there was too much going on, &quot;lack of time, lack of space, meant you couldn't get back to that first plate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is especially true in presidential or quasi-presidential systems, where any big decision has to be taken by the person at the top. There are only so many hours in the day, only so much room in the leader's head. When people speak of &quot;limited bandwidth&quot;, this is what they mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, that's always been true: leaders have to deal with both the crises the public know about and those boiling away below the surface, as well as trying to advance their own agenda, rather than merely reacting to events. But in an age that Michael Ignatieff describes as &quot;the new world disorder&quot;, where Isis and Ebola take their place alongside an ongoing war in Ukraine, and where the authoritarian behemoths Russia and China are becoming more assertive, that is becoming harder than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is simply not enough capacity to deal with all these problems at once. We make mistakes in our handling of each of them, and so they all get worse. Isis feeds Ebola, and Ebola feeds Isis - and our fear feeds them both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain and the United States have issued stark warnings that the international community will be responsible for a substantial loss of life in west Africa and a greater threat across the world unless the financial and medical response to the Ebola crisis is intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the World Health Organisation (WHO) admitted mishandling the early stages of the outbreak, US secretary of state John Kerry said a failure to respond could turn Ebola into &quot;a scourge like HIV or polio&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry criticised the international community for providing only a third of the UN target of $1bn (&pound;620m). He called on world leaders to provide cash, helicopters and treatment centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting growing impatience with the limited response from countries such as Russia and China, he said: &quot;If we don't adequately address this current outbreak now, then Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio, that we will end up fighting, all of us, for decades. And we shouldn't kid ourselves. Winning this fight is going to be costly, it is going to take all of our efforts, and it is not risk-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron wrote to the European council president, Herman Van Rompuy, to call on EU leaders to agree at a summit next week to donate an extra euros 1bn (&pound;790m) and to despatch 2,000 European clinicians and workers to the region within a month. In his letter in advance of a European summit in Brussels next week, the prime minister wrote: &quot;If we do not significantly step up our collective response now, the loss of life and damage to the political, economic and social fabric of the region will be substantial and the threat posed to our citizens will also grow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron wants EU leaders to agree to dispatch at least 2,000 workers to west Africa within the next month, to increase co-ordination of screening at European ports, and improve coordination of flights to west Africa to fly frontline health staff to the region. Britain believes Germany is starting to respond, though it considers this has been slow. The interventions by Britain and the US came as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Barack Obama named an Ebola &quot;tsar&quot; to take charge of combating the virus in the US and health officials revealed they were monitoring 16 people connected to a nurse who has the virus. The government also asked three biology labs to submit plans for producing the experimental anti-Ebola drug ZMapp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical group, said a vaccine it was working on would be &quot;too late for this epidemic&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the death toll rose to 4,546 out of 9,191 cases in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned that international pledges were not having any impact on the spread of the virus. Christopher Stokes, who is leading the charity's response, welcomed pledges of help, but told the BBC they were &quot;not having any significant impact on the epidemic and it won't now for maybe another month or month and a half&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WHO draft document obtained by the Associated Press said: &quot;Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see fairly plain writing on the wall.&quot; Experts should have realised that the conventional way of containing an outbreak would not work in a region with porous borders and broken health systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, chided the international community because only $100,000 had been paid into his $1bn trust fund to fight Ebola. A further $20m has been pledged but not received. A wider UN appeal has received $376m, about 38% of the amount the UN is seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has pledged more than &pound;125m in aid to Sierra Leone because of its historic ties to its former west African colony. Britain is providing more than 700 treatment beds across the country, while 750 troops are to be deployed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and France are focusing on Liberia and Guinea because of their historic ties. French aid to Guinea adds up to more than euros 70m. The German government has so far promised to support the aid effort in west Africa with a total of euros 102m.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The giant pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline said yesterday that its work on a vaccine for Ebola will &quot;come too late&quot; to do anything about the current situation. Even now it is trying to compress trials that would normally take a decade into a year. The impression it gives is that it is working flat out, no holds barred. But hang on a moment. Ebola was discovered back in 1976. What has GlaxoSmithKline been doing since then? Answer: not much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small clue to why can be found by looking at the stock price of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, the Canadian-based drugs firm that some investors seem to think is leading the pack on Ebola research. Tekmira shares rose a massive 180% from mid-July to October, with most of the share-price action coming when the virus jumped to Europe and the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has been killing people in central and western Africa for at least 38 years - but it's only when the virus becomes a threat to the developed world that there is seen to be a profit in it. I know it sounds cynical to say it flat out like that - but it sounds cynical because it is. What business case is there for developing drugs to save the lives of poor Africans when they don't have the money to pay for them? Especially when there is so much more profit to be had in - for instance - giving rich white men erections. As a study in last year's Lancet showed, of the 336 new drugs developed in the first decade of this century, only four of them were for what are known in jargon as neglected tropical diseases - three for malaria and one for diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point being this: the business model of market-driven big (or even medium-sized) pharma does not work well to address the challenges posed by a virus that ultimately has no respect for geography or bank balance. Some of the developed world's early interest in Ebola was in whether it could be weaponised. It was said that the Russian biological weapons unit - Biopreparat - had turned Ebola into an aerosol spray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is red meat for conspiracy theorists (like those who tell you that the patent for the Ebola virus is owned by the US government, which is true). But my suspicion is not about shady government actions but about basic capitalist economics. Isn't it interesting that there is money about to ask scientists to turn a virus into a weapon, but not the money about to ask scientists to find a vaccine? And by the time there's a market for a vaccine, it's too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What better example of what is commonly called market failure - that state of affairs in which market forces do not make for desirable outcomes. Here's another example: remember Nelson Mandela having to take on the big pharmaceutical companies as thousands of dying South Africans were unable to afford Aids drugs. Apparently, the market-driven economics of health care do not have an answer to a virus that begins in a part of the world where there isn't much money. And that is often where dangerous viruses begin. Which is precisely why market forces will not be able to save us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, on the contrary, market-driven healthcare is incentivised to keep us sick. For what profit is there in a healthy population? If everyone were healthy, it would be the job of the pharmaceutical companies to persuade us that we were not well, that certain things about us needed fixing, putting right (even if they didn't).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its a bit like Friedrich Nietzsche's criticism of the Christian priest: that the priest first has to poison us into imagining we are unwell - and thus in need of saving - before he can present himself as the cure, as salvation. There is no market for salvation in a sinless world. Of course, big pharma presents itself as evidence-based and scientific. Not at all like Nietzsche's Christianity. But it's not the science that calls the tune. It is the stock price. And the stock price goes up when rich people feel threatened.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every Sunday since she can remember, Annette Sanoh has attended church in Susan's Bay, a slum of crowded tin-roofed homes in Freetown. Now as the Ebola epidemic mushrooms in the capital of Sierra Leone, Sanoh has started going to church services almost every night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe we are all in God's hands now. Business is bad because of this Ebola problem, so rather than sit at home, I prefer to go to church and pray because I don't know what else we can do,&quot; said Sanoh, a market trader. At the church she attends, a small building jammed between a hairdresser's and two homes, she first washes her hands in a bucket of chlorinated water before joining hands with fellow church members as they pray together.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We pray Ebola will not be our portion and we pray for hope,&quot; said Sanoh, as the disease this week reached the last remaining district that hadn't yet recorded a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By any measure, West Africa is deeply religious and the region is home to some of the world's fastest-growing Muslim and Christian populations. Posters and banners strewn across the city are constant reminders of the hope many find in spirituality amid a fearful and increasingly desperate situation. In one supermarket, a notice asking customers to pray for Ebola to end was taped on to a fridge full of butter. It urged Muslims to recite the alfathia; Christians, Our Father; and Hindus Namaste. &quot;For non-believers, please believe in God. Amen, Amina,&quot; it finished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials have fretted about the impact of influential spiritual leaders, worrying that evangelical churches which sometimes hold services promising &quot;healing&quot; could ignite new chains of transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the outbreak races into its eleventh month, leaving behind almost 4,500 dead across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, experts have warned that an influx of international aid can only contain the epidemic alongside other measures in communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Control of transmission of Ebola in the community, that's going to be the key for controlling this epidemic,&quot; said Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, speaking at Oxford University on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will it be possible without the vaccine? We really don't know, because it supposes a massive behavioural change in the community; behavioural change about funeral rites, so people don't touch dead bodies any longer, in carers, as people could be infected while transporting someone to a hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are signs that messages are filtering through. Some churches are playing a critical role in educating their congregations about the disease, which is spread through direct contact with body fluids of those already showing symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, pastor Amos Teah, said once full pews were now largely empty as members feared gathering in crowds, while he has changed the way he conducts his Methodist church services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days we go to church, we sing, but we no longer carry out the tradition of passing the peace. We no longer shake hands. We are even thinking about using spoons to serve communion . . . to drop the bread into a person's palm, avoiding all contacts with that person. The church has placed strong emphasis on prevention,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other changes, women no longer wore veils to church, as they were often shared among churchgoers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Guinea, an 85% Muslim country, Abou Fofana said he had stopped going to mosque for another reason. &quot;Even though I survived Ebola, nobody wants to come near me. Even my children have faced problems as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he still continued to pray at home. Like many survivors, he credits his faith in helping him pull through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the MSF centre in Sierra Leone's forested interior of Kailahun, Malcolm Hugo, a psychologist, said he hadn't been able to find a pastor willing to visit the centre. So the church services are &quot;mainly filled with Muslims attending,&quot; said Hugo, one particularly bad afternoon in which several children had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health experts and officials warn that the longer the epidemic is left unchecked, the greater the risk of it spreading to other countries in a region where families extend across porous borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in one piece of rare good news, yesterday the UN health agency officially declared an end to the Ebola outbreak in Senegal. The WHO commended the country on its &quot;diligence to end the transmission of the virus,&quot; citing Senegal's quick and thorough response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case of Ebola in Senegal was confirmed on 29 August in a young man who had travelled by road to Dakar from Guinea, where he had direct contact with an Ebola patient. By 5 September laboratory samples from the patient tested negative, indicating that he had recovered from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the outbreak is now officially over, Senegal's geographical position makes the country vulnerable to additional imported cases of Ebola virus disease,&quot; WHO said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be enough. It is certainly a bit late. But at least the response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa by the US, Britain and France now involves a significant commitment of people and resources. The same cannot be said of others among the world's most influential countries, whose miserly and irresponsible reaction to the epidemic belies their claims to 21st-century global leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, was not naming names when he spoke of his dismay that some were not doing enough to combat what the World Health Organisation (WHO) terms a global security threat. But a large question mark hangs over the contributions of China and Russia, the two other permanent members of the UN security council, as well as other emerging powers including the remaining, supposedly up-and-coming Brics countries - Brazil, India and South Africa. &quot;It's time that those other countries who really have capacity . . . provide financial and other logistical support,&quot; he said. For the habitually cautious Ban, this was fighting talk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4,500 people, mostly in west Africa, have died from Ebola since the epidemic began this year. Last month, the UN said $988m was needed to tackle the disease over the next six months. Since then $365m has been committed in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the hardest-hit countries, but nearly all that money was donated directly to UN agencies and NGOs. Colombia, one of the world's poorer countries, was alone in paying $100,000 into the UN fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the Ebola response has been spearheaded by the usual suspects. Britain has taken the lead in assisting Sierra Leone, a former colony. Likewise, the US is centring its efforts on Liberia, with which it has historic ties, while France is concentrating on Guinea. The UN fund, if appropriately supported by other donors, could be used to supplement these efforts, which in Britain's case involve &pound;125m in bilateral assistance as well as the deployment of military assets and NHS volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, warned that the international community had no choice but to support the battle against Ebola. &quot;It is not a matter of choosing whether to do it or not. It's just a question of when we pay the price for it,&quot; he said. &quot;Countries need to support the UN fund. They have to step up and they have to put the money in right now. It is the most rational thing to do from humanitarian, public health and economic perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such pleas, the response of many, so far unaffected, countries remains unimpressive. China, the world's second largest economy, initially offered a paltry $38m in aid. On Thursday it raised that sum by $16m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, the US this week announced an additional $142m in humanitarian aid, on top of its extensive, previously announced, military and other multilateral assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding President Vladimir Putin's insistence on Russia's revived superpower status, its contribution has been minor league, mainly comprising $1m in food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent reluctance of the 21st century's emerging powers to take on a bigger role is not merely a matter of money. Politics plays a part, too. The leaders of these rising countries, proud of their enhanced standing, do not want to be viewed as tamely following in the west's footsteps. Yet the paradox highlighted by this crisis is that even as they tell the western powers their day is done, China and others duck the responsibilities of global leadership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 800 NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics have signed up to work in Sierra Leone as the spread of Ebola continues to outpace efforts to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But medical charities operating in west Africa warn that &quot;hysteria&quot; whipped up about a potential outbreak in Europe or the US could compromise efforts to attract thousands more volunteers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Casey, head of International Medical Corps's Ebola emergency response team in Liberia, said: &quot;There's some serious fear and paranoia around that's not based on facts, and they haven't anything to worry about. If someone doesn't have symptoms you can't give someone Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casey recounts the experience of one of his colleagues, a Spanish nurse returning from Liberia, who was told by her friends she was no longer welcome in their flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people feel like they are going to be a pariah they are not going to volunteer. These people who volunteer should feel like heroes. They have risked everything,&quot; Casey said. &quot;But if people are worried that they are going to be shunned, this could really compromise the response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US-born Casey said that compared to volunteer numbers after last year's earthquake in the Philippines &quot;we have seen a slow trickle at best&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These cases in the US and Spain have been isolated. Ebola is not going to knock down these countries, but if it gets into places like Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, especially in this paranoid environment it will be a catastrophe on an unimaginable scale,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the US and the UK committed to building more than 20 new Ebola treatment units in Sierra Leone and Liberia, pressure on recruitment is growing. The Department for International Development (DfID) is scheduled to open its 100-bed hospital outside the Sierra Leone capital Freetown on 27 October, and there are plans to build four more Ebola treatment hospitals in Sierra Leone, taking capacity up to 700-beds. These five facilities will require up to 2,000 international staff, DfID told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first NHS volunteers are expected to arrive around November or December but over time will be absorbed by other agencies on the ground. They will be seconded for up to two months with their salaries paid by DfID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London-based intensive-care nurse Margarita Toumasou, who responded to a separate volunteer appeal by Avaaz, the online campaign, said: &quot;There are risks every day with our job with HIV, with hepatitis. They need people to deliver the therapeutic care. They are not getting the numbers they need and we are trained to cope with risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign to attract volunteers has its own problems however, including a bottleneck in training. So far only 130 out of the 800 volunteers have been vetted for suitability, and 120 of those have been approved. They will then still need two weeks of training in the UK followed by more &quot;live&quot; training in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUARDIAN COMMENT AND DEBATE PAGES; Pg. 41</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1042 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are dark, unseen enemies, come from far away - and they are scaring us witless. Isis is not a disease, and Ebola is not a terror organisation. But fear is their common currency: intentional for one, inevitable for the other. Today they can seem to be working in tandem, a pincer movement paralysing the world's governments as it terrifies the world's people. Each time one advances, the space for the other expands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the vantage point of the west, the similarities are obvious. It starts with a menace that was once obscure and understood by few, with a name that keeps shifting (is it Isis, Isil or IS?) or a pronunciation that is uncertain (is it ee-boh-la or ebb-ola?), and which suddenly becomes all-pervasive, threatening catastrophe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both cases, the turning point came when the victims were no longer distant others, but people deemed to be like us. So the Islamic State became impossible to ignore not when it conducted mass executions, on camera, of hundreds of Iraqi and Syrian fighters, but when it beheaded western hostages, men whose names sounded like our own: James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning. Ebola was an African problem until cases surfaced in places we could point to on a map: Madrid or Dallas. The Isis and Ebola stories are both captured by a simple Andre Carrilho cartoon showing a ward full of dying black people - with a cluster of TV cameras huddling around the lone white victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the greater similarity is the feeling of impotence that both crises prompt. The US, the most armed nation in the history of humankind, which spends more on weapons than the 10 next highest-spending nations combined - along with five European allies and partners from the Gulf states - is pounding Isis from the air and yet making only marginal progress. No one is talking of victory over Isis; most speak of merely containing it. Meanwhile, the same US, with all its state-of-the-art technology and germproof suits, couldn't prevent one of its nurses catching Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against that impotence rages the cry that something must be done. It loses little ardour when it is confronted with evidence that that something is likely to do no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, military strategists pointed out the obvious defects in a policy of air strikes against Isis. Surely its fighters would hide themselves and their (serious) military kit rather than remain exposed in plain sight. And if Isis did hide among civilians, then western attacks would end up killing innocents not militants, thereby creating sympathy, and recruits, for the jihadists. As for the British (and European) willingness to hit Isis in Iraq but not Syria, that surely was to insist on a border that had been erased by war. Isis operates in both countries, combining them into a single battlefield. Surely it was quaintly legalistic of America's allies to preserve a distinction that events had made defunct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The errors in the anti-Ebola strategy were just as obvious. &quot;Enhanced screening&quot; at British airports and Eurostar terminals carries the smack of firm, decisive action. But health experts coughed politely and noted that such screening would not pick up those whose symptoms were not yet visible, and would be no protection at all against those who lied about their movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experts further warned that a likely product of such measures would be increased anxiety, which might hinder - not help - the one action that really would make a difference: getting doctors and nurses to go to west Africa and combat Ebola on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not as if policymakers don't hear these warnings. They do. As chief of staff to Tony Blair during a decade in Downing Street, Jonathan Powell managed a fair few crises. He says of President Obama and Isis: &quot;He knows bombing has no chance. He wants to be the man who ends wars, not starts them. He's taking action he knows can't succeed. There's a logical dissonance there and it shows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron is, no doubt, similarly conflicted, though for different reasons. He surely believes air strikes over Iraq but not Syria make little sense, but political reality - given parliament's veto of action against Syria last year - means he can act in one area but not the other. On both Isis and Ebola politicians are aware of the limits on their capabilities, yet have to make a show of mastery and control. Yesterday, Obama appointed an Ebola tsar, a title that suggests a contagious disease can be instructed to recede by imperial fiat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the biggest problem might also be the most prosaic. It is simply that these two big crises have struck at once. In 1999, during the Kosovo war, I asked a White House official about progress on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He confessed to me that even the White House - regularly imagined by Hollywood as the throbbing heart of power, bursting with might - could only cope with one major international issue at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell puts the capacity a little higher than that, recalling his own &quot;rule of six&quot;, by which he could cope with six problems - small, medium or large - at once, but no more. He pictured himself running between spinning plates. If there was too much going on, &quot;lack of time, lack of space, meant you couldn't get back to that first plate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is especially true in presidential or quasi-presidential systems, where any big decision has to be taken by the person at the top. There are only so many hours in the day, only so much room in the leader's head. When people speak of &quot;limited bandwidth&quot;, this is what they mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, that's always been true: leaders have to deal with both the crises the public know about and those boiling away below the surface, as well as trying to advance their own agenda, rather than merely reacting to events. But in an age that Michael Ignatieff describes as &quot;the new world disorder&quot;, where Isis and Ebola take their place alongside an ongoing war in Ukraine, and where the authoritarian behemoths Russia and China are becoming more assertive, that is becoming harder than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is simply not enough capacity to deal with all these problems at once. We make mistakes in our handling of each of them, and so they all get worse. Isis feeds Ebola, and Ebola feeds Isis - and our fear feeds them both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain and the United States issued stark warnings that the international community will be responsible for a substantial loss of life in west Africa and a greater threat across the world unless the financial and medical response to the Ebola crisis is intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the World Health Organisation (WHO) admitted mishandling the early stages of the outbreak, US secretary of state John Kerry said a failure to respond could turn Ebola into &quot;a scourge like HIV or polio&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry criticised the international community for providing only a third of the UN target of $1bn (&pound;620m). He called on world leaders to provide cash, helicopters and treatment centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting growing impatience with the limited response from countries such as Russia and China, he said: &quot;If we don't adequately address this current outbreak now, then Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio, that we will end up fighting, all of us, for decades. And we shouldn't kid ourselves. Winning this fight is going to be costly, it is going to take all of our efforts, and it is not risk-free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron wrote to the European council president Herman Van Rompuy to call on EU leaders to agree at a summit next week to donate an extra euros 1bn (&pound;790m) and to despatch 2,000 European clinicians and workers to the region within a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter in advance of a European summit in Brussels next week, the prime minister wrote: &quot;If we do not significantly step up our collective response now, the loss of life and damage to the political, economic and social fabric of the region will be substantial and the threat posed to our citizens will also grow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron wants EU leaders to agree to dispatch at least 2,000 workers to west Africa within the next month, to increase co-ordination of screening at European ports and to improve co-ordination of flights to west Africa to fly frontline health staff to the region. Britain believes Germany is starting to respond though it believes this has been slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interventions by Britain and the US came as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Barack Obama named an Ebola &quot;tsar&quot; to take charge of combating the virus in the US, as health officials revealed they were monitoring 16 people connected to a nurse who has the virus;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical group, said a vaccine it was working on would be &quot;too late for this epidemic&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the death toll rose to 4,546 out of 9,191 cases in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned that international pledges were not having any impact on the spread of the virus. Christopher Stokes, who is leading the charity's response, welcomed pledges of help but told the BBC they were &quot;not having any significant impact on the epidemic and it won't now for maybe another month or month and a half&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WHO draft document obtained by the Associated Press said: &quot;Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see fairly plain writing on the wall.&quot; Experts should have realised the conventional way of containing an outbreak would not work in a region with porous borders and broken health systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, chided the international community because only $100,000 had been paid into his $1bn trust fund to fight Ebola. A further $20m has been pledged but not received. A wider UN appeal has received $376m, about 38% of the amount the UN is seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has pledged more than &pound;125m in aid to Sierra Leone because of its historic ties to its former West African colony. Britain is providing more than 700 treatment beds across the country while 750 troops are to be deployed there. The US and France are focusing on Liberia and Guinea because of their historic ties. French aid to Guinea amounts to more than euros 70m. The German government has so far promised to support the aid effort in west Africa with a total of euros 102m.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The giant pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline said yesterday that its work on a vaccine for Ebola will &quot;come too late&quot; to do anything about the current situation. Even now it is trying to compress trials that would normally take a decade into a year. The impression it gives is that it is working flat out, no holds barred. But hang on a moment. Ebola was discovered back in 1976. What has GlaxoSmithKline been doing since then? Answer: not much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small clue to why can be found by looking at the stock price of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, the Canadian-based drugs firm that some investors seem to think is leading the pack on Ebola research. Tekmira shares rose a massive 180% from mid-July to October, with most of the share-price action coming when the virus jumped to Europe and the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has been killing people in central and western Africa for at least 38 years - but it's only when the virus becomes a threat to the developed world that there is seen to be a profit in it. I know it sounds cynical to say it flat out like that - but it sounds cynical because it is. What business case is there for developing drugs to save the lives of poor Africans when they don't have the money to pay for them? Especially when there is so much more profit to be had in - for instance - giving rich white men erections. As a study in last year's Lancet showed, of the 336 new drugs developed in the first decade of this century, only four of them were for what are known in jargon as neglected tropical diseases - three for malaria and one for diarrhoea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point being this: the business model of market-driven big (or even medium-sized) pharma does not work well to address the challenges posed by a virus that ultimately has no respect for geography or bank balance. Some of the developed world's early interest in Ebola was in whether it could be weaponised. It was said that the Russian biological weapons unit - Biopreparat - had turned Ebola into an aerosol spray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is red meat for conspiracy theorists (like those who tell you that the patent for the Ebola virus is owned by the US government, which is true). But my suspicion is not about shady government actions but about basic capitalist economics. Isn't it interesting that there is money about to ask scientists to turn a virus into a weapon, but not the money about to ask scientists to find a vaccine? And by the time there's a market for a vaccine, it's too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What better example of what is commonly called market failure - that state of affairs in which market forces do not make for desirable outcomes. Here's another example: remember Nelson Mandela having to take on the big pharmaceutical companies as thousands of dying South Africans were unable to afford Aids drugs. Apparently, the market-driven economics of health care do not have an answer to a virus that begins in a part of the world where there isn't much money. And that is often where dangerous viruses begin. Which is precisely why market forces will not be able to save us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, on the contrary, market-driven healthcare is incentivised to keep us sick. For what profit is there in a healthy population? If everyone were healthy, it would be the job of the pharmaceutical companies to persuade us that we were not well, that certain things about us needed fixing, putting right (even if they didn't).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its a bit like Friedrich Nietzsche's criticism of the Christian priest: that the priest first has to poison us into imagining we are unwell - and thus in need of saving - before he can present himself as the cure, as salvation. There is no market for salvation in a sinless world. Of course, big pharma presents itself as evidence-based and scientific. Not at all like Nietzsche's Christianity. But it's not the science that calls the tune. It is the stock price. And the stock price goes up when rich people feel threatened.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every Sunday since she can remember, Annette Sanoh has attended church in Susan's Bay, a slum of crowded tin-roofed homes in Freetown. Now as the Ebola epidemic mushrooms in the capital of Sierra Leone, Sanoh has started going to church services almost every night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe we are all in God's hands now. Business is bad because of this Ebola problem, so rather than sit at home, I prefer to go to church and pray because I don't know what else we can do,&quot; said Sanoh, a market trader. At the church she attends, a small building jammed between a hairdresser's and two homes, she first washes her hands in a bucket of chlorinated water before joining hands with fellow church members as they pray together.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We pray Ebola will not be our portion and we pray for hope,&quot; said Sanoh, as the disease this week reached the last remaining district that hadn't yet recorded a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By any measure, West Africa is deeply religious and the region is home to some of the world's fastest-growing Muslim and Christian populations. Posters and banners strewn across the city are constant reminders of the hope many find in spirituality amid a fearful and increasingly desperate situation. In one supermarket, a notice asking customers to pray for Ebola to end was taped on to a fridge full of butter. It urged Muslims to recite the alfathia; Christians, Our Father; and Hindus Namaste. &quot;For non-believers, please believe in God. Amen, Amina,&quot; it finished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials have fretted about the impact of influential spiritual leaders, worrying that evangelical churches which sometimes hold services promising &quot;healing&quot; could ignite new chains of transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the outbreak races into its eleventh month, leaving behind almost 4,500 dead across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, experts have warned that an influx of international aid can only contain the epidemic alongside other measures in communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Control of transmission of Ebola in the community, that's going to be the key for controlling this epidemic,&quot; said Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, speaking at Oxford University on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will it be possible without the vaccine? We really don't know, because it supposes a massive behavioural change in the community; behavioural change about funeral rites, so people don't touch dead bodies any longer, in carers, as people could be infected while transporting someone to a hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are signs that messages are filtering through. Some churches are playing a critical role in educating their congregations about the disease, which is spread through direct contact with body fluids of those already showing symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, pastor Amos Teah, said once full pews were now largely empty as members feared gathering in crowds, while he has changed the way he conducts his Methodist church services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days we go to church, we sing, but we no longer carry out the tradition of passing the peace. We no longer shake hands. We are even thinking about using spoons to serve communion . . . to drop the bread into a person's palm, avoiding all contacts with that person. The church has placed strong emphasis on prevention,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other changes, women no longer wore veils to church, as they were often shared among churchgoers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Guinea, an 85% Muslim country, Abou Fofana said he had stopped going to mosque for another reason. &quot;Even though I survived Ebola, nobody wants to come near me. Even my children have faced problems as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he still continued to pray at home. Like many survivors, he credits his faith in helping him pull through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the MSF centre in Sierra Leone's forested interior of Kailahun, Malcolm Hugo, a psychologist, said he hadn't been able to find a pastor willing to visit the centre. So the church services are &quot;mainly filled with Muslims attending,&quot; said Hugo, one particularly bad afternoon in which several children had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health experts and officials warn that the longer the epidemic is left unchecked, the greater the risk of it spreading to other countries in a region where families extend across porous borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in one piece of rare good news, yesterday the UN health agency officially declared an end to the Ebola outbreak in Senegal. The WHO commended the country on its &quot;diligence to end the transmission of the virus,&quot; citing Senegal's quick and thorough response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case of Ebola in Senegal was confirmed on 29 August in a young man who had travelled by road to Dakar from Guinea, where he had direct contact with an Ebola patient. By 5 September laboratory samples from the patient tested negative, indicating that he had recovered from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the outbreak is now officially over, Senegal's geographical position makes the country vulnerable to additional imported cases of Ebola virus disease,&quot; WHO said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be enough. It is certainly a bit late. But at least the response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa by the US, Britain and France now involves a significant commitment of people and resources. The same cannot be said of others among the world's most influential countries, whose miserly and irresponsible reaction to the epidemic belies their claims to 21st-century global leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, was not naming names when he spoke of his dismay that some were not doing enough to combat what the World Health Organisation (WHO) terms a global security threat. But a large question mark hangs over the contributions of China and Russia, the two other permanent members of the UN security council, as well as other emerging powers including the remaining, supposedly up-and-coming Brics countries - Brazil, India and South Africa. &quot;It's time that those other countries who really have capacity . . . provide financial and other logistical support,&quot; he said. For the habitually cautious Ban, this was fighting talk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4,500 people, mostly in west Africa, have died from Ebola since the epidemic began this year. Last month, the UN said $988m was needed to tackle the disease over the next six months. Since then $365m has been committed in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the hardest-hit countries, but nearly all that money was donated directly to UN agencies and NGOs. Colombia, one of the world's poorer countries, was alone in paying $100,000 into the UN fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the Ebola response has been spearheaded by the usual suspects. Britain has taken the lead in assisting Sierra Leone, a former colony. Likewise, the US is centring its efforts on Liberia, with which it has historic ties, while France is concentrating on Guinea. The UN fund, if appropriately supported by other donors, could be used to supplement these efforts, which in Britain's case involve &pound;125m in bilateral assistance as well as the deployment of military assets and NHS volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, warned that the international community had no choice but to support the battle against Ebola. &quot;It is not a matter of choosing whether to do it or not. It's just a question of when we pay the price for it,&quot; he said. &quot;Countries need to support the UN fund. They have to step up and they have to put the money in right now. It is the most rational thing to do from humanitarian, public health and economic perspective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such pleas, the response of many, so far unaffected, countries remains unimpressive. China, the world's second largest economy, initially offered a paltry $38m in aid. On Thursday it raised that sum by $16m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, the US this week announced an additional $142m in humanitarian aid, on top of its extensive, previously announced, military and other multilateral assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding President Vladimir Putin's insistence on Russia's revived superpower status, its contribution has been minor league, mainly comprising $1m in food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent reluctance of the 21st century's emerging powers to take on a bigger role is not merely a matter of money. Politics plays a part, too. The leaders of these rising countries, proud of their enhanced standing, do not want to be viewed as tamely following in the west's footsteps. Yet the paradox highlighted by this crisis is that even as they tell the western powers their day is done, China and others duck the responsibilities of global leadership.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 800 NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics have signed up to work in Sierra Leone as the spread of Ebola continues to outpace efforts to contain the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But medical charities operating in west Africa warn that &quot;hysteria&quot; whipped up about a potential outbreak in Europe or the US could compromise efforts to attract thousands more volunteers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Casey, head of International Medical Corps's Ebola emergency response team in Liberia, said: &quot;There's some serious fear and paranoia around that's not based on facts, and they haven't anything to worry about. If someone doesn't have symptoms you can't give someone Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casey recounts the experience of one of his colleagues, a Spanish nurse returning from Liberia, who was told by her friends she was no longer welcome in their flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people feel like they are going to be a pariah they are not going to volunteer. These people who volunteer should feel like heroes. They have risked everything,&quot; Casey said. &quot;But if people are worried that they are going to be shunned, this could really compromise the response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US-born Casey said that compared to volunteer numbers after last year's earthquake in the Philippines &quot;we have seen a slow trickle at best&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These cases in the US and Spain have been isolated. Ebola is not going to knock down these countries, but if it gets into places like Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, especially in this paranoid environment it will be a catastrophe on an unimaginable scale,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the US and the UK committed to building more than 20 new Ebola treatment units in Sierra Leone and Liberia, pressure on recruitment is growing. The Department for International Development (DfID) is scheduled to open its 100-bed hospital outside the Sierra Leone capital Freetown on 27 October, and there are plans to build four more Ebola treatment hospitals in Sierra Leone, taking capacity up to 700-beds. These five facilities will require up to 2,000 international staff, DfID told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first NHS volunteers are expected to arrive around November or December but over time will be absorbed by other agencies on the ground. They will be seconded for up to two months with their salaries paid by DfID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London-based intensive-care nurse Margarita Toumasou, who responded to a separate volunteer appeal by Avaaz, the online campaign, said: &quot;There are risks every day with our job with HIV, with hepatitis. They need people to deliver the therapeutic care. They are not getting the numbers they need and we are trained to cope with risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign to attract volunteers has its own problems however, including a bottleneck in training. So far only 130 out of the 800 volunteers have been vetted for suitability, and 120 of those have been approved. They will then still need two weeks of training in the UK followed by more &quot;live&quot; training in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEAR in the West over the risk of catching ebola has reached such a peak that an air passenger was pictured wearing a protective suit at an airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman was seen in the blue plastic Hazmat suit - complete with gloves and mask - in the departure lounge of Dulles International Airport in Washington.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the latest sign of growing concerns in the West about the spread of the deadly virus, which has already killed 4,500 people in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Barack Obama ordered his officials to respond to the disease in a much more aggressive way' as he cancelled planned visits to focus on tackling the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were fresh ebola scares across Europe and North America yesterday as new suspected cases were identified in Spain, France and the US. Emergency procedures were put in place at Madrid airport after a traveller from Nigeria arriving on an Air France jet with 163 passengers on board complained that he had a fever and shivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers wearing protective suits took the man by ambulance to a hospital in the Spanish capital. The return flight was cancelled and the plane is to be disinfected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish authorities are also examining two other people for ebola. Tests are being carried out on a person who came into contact with infected Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero, 44, whose condition is said to be improving. The other suspected victim is a missionary who came down with a fever after returning from Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clues to the current market turmoil can be found in the Scottish referendum, the Ebola outbreak and a set of 17 dots. The last of these are the &quot;dots diagrams&quot; that the US Federal Reserve uses to illustrate where its officials think interest rates will be in the future. They provide a glimpse inside the decision-making process of the main monetary control room in the world. And the picture that emerges is, frankly, terrifying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fed officials currently believe that US interest rates at the end of next year could be anywhere between 0pc and 3pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opinions diverge even more for the end of 2016; the officials think that rates could be anywhere between 0.25pc and 4.25pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, Fed officials have almost no clue at all where interest rates for the world's largest economy will be in 15 months' time. And these are the people who are supposed to be setting them. If they're confused, what hope do the rest of us have?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For several months now the Federal Reserve has been winding down its bond-buying programme and hinting that it will raise rates at some point next year. But, after less than two days of market turbulence (and despite the fact that the Fed says it doesn't target the markets), St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard yesterday said the Fed should consider prolonging QE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are these officials clueless? No. But the complexity of the issues they face is bordering on the overwhelming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eurozone looks like it is stuttering again and the market is worried that policymakers either can't or won't do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world is still massively over-leveraged. The global debt to GDP ratio hit a new record high of 215pc at the end of last year, up from around 200pc when the financial crisis hit. While one wouldn't want to fall for the &quot;household fallacy&quot; of assuming all debt is bad, it is undoubtedly true that heavily indebted countries, like many of those in the eurozone, will find it increasingly hard to meet debt payment as inflation creeps ever lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, said in 2012 that he would do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to save the euro, he had the implicit backing of Germany. Now the mood music has changed. Indeed, Mr Draghi's statement is currently being tested in the European Union's highest court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the eurozone can't be persuaded to save itself (and the rest of the global economy along with it), the crisis of democracy and representation in the developed world, which was illustrated by the Scottish referendum, will worsen. Citizens feel that their elected representatives are powerless against the forces of globalisation. They may have a point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spread of Ebola, the rise of Islamic State and the world's inability to tackle the threat of climate change all point to a failure of global co-ordination. People are asking themselves whether, if governance can't be managed on a global scale, it might not be better to push for more localised power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Huge global problems require global solutions. But there is a scary possibility, even when you join up all the dots, that these simply don't exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA-HIT London Mining has toppled into administration after failing to find a buyer for the business as it struggled with debts following a slump in iron ore prices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company's board had been working with Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered to try to find a strategic buyer to plug a funding gap, which meant that it was running out of money to service its only operating iron ore mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The collapse comes just a week after London Mining's chief executive, Graeme Hossie, warned investors that there was little to no value left in the equity of the shares. Shares of the company closed down to 4.5p before they were suspended, a 95pc fall from where they were a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Administrators at PwC took control of the company yesterday and are searching for a buyer for London Mining's Marampa mine, which employs close to 1,400 people in Sierra Leone and has iron ore reserves expected to support production for the next 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that Indian steel conglomerate Jindal, which had been in discussions about taking over the company, is interested in buying the mine. Frank Timis, African Minerals' chairman, is also understood to be interested in Marampa. Both know the mine well and Jindal already takes production from Marampa, meaning that it could acquire the mine to streamline its business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The collapse in iron ore prices and the resulting impacts on this business have been very dramatic. Our focus is to ensure that a buyer is found for the Marampa Mine operations given it is such an important part of the Sierra Leone economy&quot; Russell Downs, joint administrator and partner at PwC, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London Mining has grappled with plummeting price of iron ore which is sitting at its lowest level since 2009. The group was also hit by a spat with commodities giant Glencore over the pricing of an iron ore supply contract, which is said to have put a squeeze on its short-term cash position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola outbreak, which has sparked a crisis in Sierra Leone, has also piled pressure on the group, which has already chartered flights to move its &quot;non-essential&quot; staff out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.5p The price of shares in London Mining before they were suspended, which represents a 95pc fall since last year</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For stock markets, October - with its fading light, silent leaf fall and first winter chills - is historically the cruellest month. This year is proving no exception. The crashes of 1929, 1987, 2001 and 2008 were all focused on this portentous month. And amid signs of another perfect storm of negatives brewing in the world economy, stocks are again plummeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the beginning of September, the FTSE 100 has fallen by more than 10 per cent, with much of the drop concentrated in the last week - a level of deterioration that satisfies the official definition of a fully blown stock market correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many European bourses, it has been a great deal worse. Greece is already back in classic bear market territory - scarcely believable so soon after the last one. Not since the peak of the Eurozone crisis in 2011-12 have we seen such manifest panic, and before then, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, six years ago. Nor is it just equities; bond yields too are back at levels that indicate a clear and present danger of deflation and economic depression.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normally there is a trigger event for such meltdowns, but unless it be the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, this time it's not entirely clear what. Rather, there has been a steady build-up of worry, culminating in an emerging consensus at last week's meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington that the global recovery is again in danger of stalling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For some economies, still struggling to climb back to pre-crisis levels of output, prospects are again looking truly desperate. It is as if the last recession never really ended at all, lending weight to those who argue that advanced economies have succumbed to &quot;secular stagnation&quot;, a semi-permanent state of impaired demand that is unresponsive to even the extreme levels of monetary stimulus of the past several years. Indeed, judged in terms of UK stock market performance, we appear trapped in a 15-year long cycle of decline. The FTSE 100 has never regained its turn-of-the-century peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The epicentre of alarm this time is again Europe, where both economic and political risks have climbed steeply in recent weeks. With Europe's southern economies gripped by conditions reminiscent of the Great Depression in the Thirties, Italy's Five Star protest movement - in some respects, the equivalent of the UK Independence Party - has promised a referendum on membership of the euro. In Greece, the ultra-Left Syriza has committed to repudiating virtually all aspects of the eurozone austerity programme, even though the country has little chance of regaining access to international debt markets once outside it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet again, the fiscal, monetary and political straitjacket that holds the single currency together is in danger of blowing apart. Just to get this in perspective, it is not yet 2012 in redux, with the explosion in risk premiums that took place back then. Even so, worries about the sustainability of European Monetary Union are back with a vengeance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, an extraordinarily low inflation reading for September has reinforced fears that the eurozone is on the slippery slope to outright deflation, a condition that if it became established would seem to condemn Europe to a repeat of Japan's 20-year slump and would further steepen the challenge of getting on top of mountainous public debts. With falling prices come delayed spending and investment decisions, and a steady ratcheting up of existing debt burdens. In such circumstances, eventual default by heavily indebted nations becomes virtually inevitable. It is not a disease any continent would want to fall victim to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A tanking oil price, which in itself is partly a response to fast abating global demand, has only further increased the chances of Europe succumbing to the illness, even though, by putting more money in people's pockets, it should in time prove helpful to the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not that the plunging oil price is all about weaker demand. Normally, such pressures would be countered by cuts to production from Opec's big swing nation, Saudi Arabia. This time around, the Saudis have decided not to play ball, in apparent determination to inflict damage on other, highercost producers - Iran, Russia, the emerging Middle Eastern Caliphate and possibly even the US, whose shale revolution is endangered by low energy prices. These geopolitical aspects of the price correction have further added to anxieties in financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, the European Central Bank's favourite gauge of inflationary expectations, the five-year forward swap rate, is currently at a record low. Europe's apparent inability to mount a credible response to deflationary threats is again centre stage. Hemmed in by German intransigence and the apparent impediment of European treaties, the ECB has so far failed to apply the monetary therapy of quantitative easing, despite its evident success in Britain and the US. The working assumption in markets is that eventually it will; whether it acts in time, however, remains very much open to question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if another leg in the eurozone crisis wasn't bad enough, there are also signs of a pronounced slowdown elsewhere in the world, with China caught between a rock and a hard place - the imperative of growth at all costs knocking up against evident concern in the Communist Party elite about repeating the economic mistakes of the West. Attempts to dampen the credit-fuelled boom of the post-crisis era may have slowed Chinese growth to below 7 per cent, a level that would be regarded as stellar by Western standards, but which for China is close to disastrous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This slowdown has in turn inflicted damage on the big export nations of Germany and Japan, and those emerging market economies heavily reliant on the commodities boom of recent years, such as Brazil. Even the US shows early signs of stumbling. Such is the degree of concern that two members of the Federal Reserve's Open Markets Committee have broken ranks to express reservations about ending asset purchases, as scheduled this month, and suggested that the Fed might be forced to consider a fourth round of them - so-called QE4. Neither of them are noted &quot;doves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every time the Fed says QE is about to end, the markets react with horror, forcing policymakers to backtrack. It is as if the world economy can never get off the adrenalin fix of central bank moneyprinting. Market expectations of the first US interest rate rise have meanwhile been pushed dramatically back from the middle of next year to well into 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overlaying it all is an even more concerning narrative - that evident fault lines exposed by the financial crisis, from dysfunctional monetary union in Europe, to growing imbalances between surplus and deficit nations, and increasing indebtedness almost everywhere, have been left festering and largely unaddressed. Worse, that attempts to smooth the post-crisis adjustment with fiscal and monetary stimulus have succeeded only in delaying the reckoning, or even adding to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On top of all this comes anxiety about the impact of Ebola. We know from less lethal diseases that international pandemics induce a high degree of behavioural aversion, with profoundly negative consequences for the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Set against this bleak international backdrop, the British economy looks like a beacon of sound governance and policy, hard though it sometimes is to believe for those of us who observe these things at close quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unemployment is back virtually to pre-crisis levels, labour participation is at its best since 2005 and job vacancies are close to an all-time high. Even long-elusive real-wage growth seems to be returning, at least in the private sector. These gains have been hard won, yet they are again in danger of derailment by external developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said that another global recession was avoidable, but only if surplus and deficit nations did the right things. Is there any likelihood of them doing so? Regrettably little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; As if the eurozone crisis wasn't bad enough, there are signs of a slowdown elsewhere in the world</SPAN></P>

A few years ago, the Department of Health warned that another pandemic is &quot;inevitable&quot; and predicted up to 750,000 British deaths. &quot;Socioeconomic disruption will be massive,&quot; it concluded. We are, apparently, just waiting for the next big virus to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps this explains the panicky reaction to Ebola. It's hardly a new disease, having emerged (and been defeated) several times before - but it has never been as big as it is now. It's certainly gruesome, killing seven in 10 people it infects with symptoms including bleeding from the eyes and ears. There are 4,500 dead so far and there are fears that there could be 10,000 new infections a week by the end of the year. The US is talking about a $1 billion aid package for Africa, and Britain too is sending teams of doctors. And this is not entirely altruistic: we're treating Ebola there, runs the subtext, to make sure it doesn't come here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this seems to confirm an old suspicion about Africa: that it is a continent of poverty and scourges, capable of incubating what might be the next big pandemic. In fact, the disease has affected just five of Africa's 53 countries, and in two of them - Nigeria and Senegal - its progress seems to have been halted. While it is contagious (through bodily fluids, rather than by air) the largest district of Sierra Leone, Koinadugu, had (until yesterday) been able to say it is Ebola-free after observing basic border checks. The disease is spreading exponentially in certain places but Africa is not, yet, at its mercy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A sense of proportion tends to be the first casualty of any new virus. It is not quite clear why the Department of Health thinks that the next pandemic will claim 750,000 British lives, given that this is three times the death toll inflicted by Spanish Flu a century ago. The last pandemic, the so-called Hong Kong flu of 1968, claimed 30,000 lives. While tragic, this figure is only slightly more than the official figure for the number of British pensioners who die of the cold each winter - a figure that is, shamefully, treated with a shrug. We have become rather good at guarding against mutant killer viruses, even if we still struggle to protect our elderly against the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most recent viruses to emerge have caused much panic and disruption, but proved far less deadly than (for example) measles. The worldwide death toll for the Sars virus was 770, and the H5N1 bird flu claimed 390 lives. These scares cost tens of billions of pounds of economic damage, due to the inevitable disruption associated with a worldwide scare. But the fatalities have not been as great as for conditions which are far less scientifically challenging - like drug addiction, heart disease or (in Britain) hospital-acquired infections like C-Difficile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The panic in the United States - much of it coming from Barack Obama's opponents - is becoming a case study in misplaced anger. Denounced as &quot;President Ebola&quot; in some sections of the American press, he is faulted for failing to set up an airport test that could have intercepted the Ebola victim being blamed for bringing the virus to the www.country.No safety net can be so tight as to catch everyone. But more to the point, where is the anger about the 40,000 Americans who die each year from preventable conditions like whooping cough and measles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the concern about Africa seems to be at odds with the threats facing the continent. Since Ebola emerged seven months ago it has claimed thousands of lives in Africa, which certainly makes it deadlier than Sars or Avian Flu. But over these same seven months, 40 times as many people will have died from basic hunger and 70 times as many Africans will have been killed by malaria - both basic, avoidable conditions that have dogged mankind from the beginning of time. So where is the anger about this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, Africans dying from malaria should cause far outrage than Ebola - given that we know perfectly well how to overcome malaria. Basic tools like insecticides, mosquito nets and sanitation can eradicate the disease. With enough resources, malaria can be snuffed out - as was proved in Sri Lanka when a US-led campaign brought the annual death toll down from 92,000 to just 17. And this was in back in 1963, when the tools available to fight malaria were far harder to come by. Various agencies, like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, have made striking progress in recent years, but malaria remains a bigger killer now then Ebola is ever likely to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The root problem is a far more basic one: poverty. The countries now battling Ebola - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - are among the poorest in the world with a pitiful health infrastructure. Foreign aid can help if it encourages a basic health service. But sending armies of aid workers can undermine a country's ability to set up a normal health service - if the work is being done by outsiders, who are working on specific projects. Jim Yong Kim, a doctor who now runs the World Bank, has said that Ebola would have been contained if it broke out in Rwanda because it used donor money to build a proper health system after its genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the greatest stories of the last decade is the extraordinary economic growth of sub-Saharan Africa - and how this is quickly translating into poverty reduction, cutting death rates from its everyday diseases. Child mortality is falling at the fastest rate in history. Malaria, too, is in fast decline as ordinary Africans can afford protection, rather than wait to have it handed out by an aid agency. Deaths from measles are down by 80 per cent over the last 10 years. HIV infections, so long the scourge of Africa, are down by a third over the same period. The United Nations envisages the epidemic being vanquished by the end of the next decade, which would be a monumental achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only this week, it emerged that hunger in Africa has fallen by a quarter over the past 25 years - an incredible achievement which will have saved millions upon millions of lives. Better-fed bodies can better fight disease; a mother is a hundred times more likely to die in childbirth in a poor country than she is a rich one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steadily, Africans are closing the gap with the rich world. Blessed with the oil and minerals that fetch such a high price in world markets, the continent is becoming richer, and converting this into prosperity. The result is a golden age of poverty reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all of the continent is growing at the same pace and in the same way, which explains why the Ebola has moved so quickly in countries which have nothing resembling a decent healthcare system. But their story is not Africa's story. The continent is making more progress against its the main killers than at any point time in modern history, so it can realistically look forward not just for to end of Aids, but to end of poverty as we know it today. The Ebola tragedy is a setback in a greater war against disease and poverty - but it is a war which Africans are steadily winning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE hospital at the centre of America's Ebola outbreak admitted yesterday that it had made mistakes and apologised, as a whistleblowing nurse described scenes of &quot;chaos&quot; there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Duncan, 42, the first person to be diagnosed with the disease in the US, died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Oct 8 and two nurses who treated him - Nina Pham and Amber Vinson - contracted the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a congressional hearing in Washington, Dr Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer of Texas state health resources, said: &quot;We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry. Despite our best intentions, and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The admission came as Briana Aguirre, a nurse, described scenes of &quot;chaos&quot; at the hospital, with staff having no idea how to tackle the virus. She said the hazmat suit she was issued had a large gap in the neck and that materials used to treat suspected Ebola patients were left festering in corridors for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She claimed that suspected Ebola patients were wheeled around the hospital without protection and that doctors were told it was acceptable to move between rooms without disinfecting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her claims came amid growing criticism that the US response to the virus has been mismanaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some politicians called for the resignation of Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, and accused his organisation of &quot;demonstrable failures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others demanded that President Barack Obama restrict air travel from west Africa, where the disease has killed more than 4,500 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a tearful television interview, Miss Aguirre said she feared for her job but believed that colleagues would be &quot;proud&quot; of her for speaking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said: &quot;I can no longer defend my hospital at all. I'm embarrassed for my hospital. I watched them violate basic principles of nursing care, of medical care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Mr Duncan arrived in an ambulance he was put in an area with up to seven other patients and it took three hours to call the CDC, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nurse caring for him was looking after three other patients at the same time and the scene was &quot;chaotic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Aguirre said: &quot;Our infectious disease department was contacted to ask 'What is our protocol?' And their answer was, 'We don't know'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There were no special precautions, no special gear. We did not know what to do with his lab specimens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Miss Pham, a friend, later became ill, Miss Aguirre was given the task of treating her. She said the hazmat suit provided was woefully inadequate. Her mouth and nose were left exposed through a gap of several inches at the neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nurse claimed she was told by hospital officials to try to close the gap with tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said: &quot;I threw a fit. I couldn't believe in the second week of an Ebola crisis the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, waste from the treatment of suspected patients was placed in hallway bins, she claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Aguirre said: &quot;There was no one to pick up the garbage for two days. It was literally piled to the ceiling. The garbage room was full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There were people going by without so much as gloves on, or having their feet covered, and walking into other clean areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola virus can survive for several days in body fluids, such as blood, at room temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked if she would want to be treated at her own hospital, the nurse said: &quot;I would try anything and everything to refuse to go there to be treated. I would feel at risk by going there. If I don't actually have Ebola, I may contract it there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said preparations for treating Ebola had consisted of an &quot;optional seminar&quot;. She added: &quot;It wasn't even suggested we go. I don't think any institution in the country is prepared for what to look for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two infected nurses have been moved from Texas. Miss Pham has been taken to the US National Institutes of Health outside Washington, while Miss Vinson has been moved to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Texas hospital defended itself against some accusations by Miss Aguirre, and similar ones from the National Nurses United union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said: &quot;The assertions do not reflect actual facts learned from the medical record and interactions with clinical caregivers. Our hospital followed the CDC guidelines and sought additional guidance and clarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the CDC is itself under fire. It emerged that CDC officials gave Miss Vinson permission to board a commercial flight despite her having an elevated temperature, a possible symptom. She was diagnosed with Ebola the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, 132 people who were on the Frontier Airlines flight are being contacted, the crew has been put on paid leave and the plane has been quarantined and stripped. Three schools in Texas were also temporarily closed after it emerged that a small number of pupils had been on the same flight as Miss Vincent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE World Health Organisation is increasing its efforts to help 15 African countries defend themselves against the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivory Coast and Mali are at greatest risk of being affected by the epidemic, Isabelle Nuttall, the WHO's health security response chief, said yesterday. She added that the organisation would send teams to the countries this weekend to ensure there was an &quot;adequate&quot; response plan if a case occurred.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The virus is known to have killed almost 4,500 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO says there have been 9,000 recorded cases in west Africa and a similar number unrecorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile in France, a nurse who treated the country's first Ebola patient was taken to a military hospital near Paris yesterday with a &quot;suspect fever&quot;, a source close to the case said. According to several sources who did not reveal their names, she was at the same hospital that treated a French nurse who contracted the virus in Liberia when working for M&eacute;d&eacute;cins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res (MSF), who has since recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three people with fever were being tested in Spain for the virus, including one who arrived on an Air France jet carrying 163 passengers that was isolated at Madrid's airport as a precaution. The man, who had travelled from Nigeria, was taken by ambulance with a driver wearing full protective gear to Madrid's Carlos III hospital. The other passengers were allowed to disembark and the plane was taken to a special area to be disinfected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another person with a fever who came into contact with the infected Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero was sent to the same hospital for testing, the health ministry said, and a missionary was being transported for testing after he came down with a fever after returning to Spain from Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also now thought that Miss Vinson may have been ill as early as last Friday - three days before she was diagnosed. Dr. Christopher Braden, a spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the CDC may now include people who were on a flight the 29-year-old nurse took to Cleveland from Dallas on Friday in its investigation of possible contacts. Officials were already attempting to track down 132 passengers, including school children, from the return flight to Dallas on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE hospital at the centre of America's Ebola outbreak admitted yesterday that it had made mistakes and apologised, as a whistle-blowing nurse described scenes of &quot;chaos&quot; there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night it also emerged that one of two nurses who contracted the virus after treating a patient at the Texas hospital may have been displaying symptoms days earlier than thought, meaning she could have come into contact with hundreds more people while contagious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Duncan, 42, the first person to be diagnosed with the disease in the US, died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Oct 8 and nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson who treated him contracted the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a congressional hearing in Washington, Dr Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer of Texas state health resources, said: &quot;We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry. Despite our best intentions, and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now thought that Miss Vinson may have been ill as early as last Friday - three days before she was diagnosed. Dr. Christopher Braden, a spokesman for the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC), said that it may now include people who were on a flight the 29-year-old nurse took to Cleveland from Dallas on Friday in its investigation of possible contacts. Offi-cials were already attempting to track down 132 passengers from the return flight to Dallas on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The admissions came as Briana Aguirre, a nurse, described scenes of &quot;chaos&quot; at the hospital, with staff having no idea how to tackle the virus. She said the hazmat suit she was issued had a large gap in the neck and that materials used to treat suspected Ebola patients were left festering in corridors for days. She claimed that suspected Ebola patients were wheeled around the hospital without protection and that doctors were told it was acceptable to move between rooms without disinfecting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her claims came amid growing criticism that the US response to the virus has been mismanaged. Some politicians called for the resignation of Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, and accused his organisation of &quot;demonstrable failures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others demanded that President Barack Obama restrict air travel from west Africa, where the disease has killed more than 4,500 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tearful television interview, Miss Aguirre said she feared for her job but believed that colleagues would be &quot;proud&quot; of her for speaking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;I can no longer defend my hospital at all. I'm embarrassed for my hospital. I watched them violate basic principles of nursing care, of medical care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr Duncan arrived in an ambulance he was put in an area with up to seven other patients and it took three hours to call the CDC, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse caring for him was looking after three other patients at the same time and the scene was &quot;chaotic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Aguirre said: &quot;Our infectious disease department was contacted to ask 'What is our protocol?' And their answer was, 'We don't know'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were no special precautions, no special gear. We did not know what to do with his lab specimens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Miss Pham, a friend, later became ill, Miss Aguirre was given the task of treating her. She said the hazmat suit provided was woefully inadequate. Her mouth and nose were left exposed through a gap of several inches at the neck. The nurse claimed she was told by hospital officials to try to close the gap with tape. She said: &quot;I threw a fit. I couldn't believe in the second week of an Ebola crisis the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, waste from the treatment of suspected patients was placed in hallway bins, she claimed. Miss Aguirre said: &quot;There was no one to pick up the garbage for two days. It was literally piled to the ceiling. The garbage room was full. There were people going by without so much as gloves on, or having their feet covered, and walking into other clean areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus can survive for several days in body fluids, such as blood, at room temperature. Asked if she would want to be treated at her own hospital, the nurse said: &quot;I would try anything and everything to refuse to go there to be treated. I would feel at risk by going there. If I don't actually have Ebola, I may contract it there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said preparations for treating Ebola had consisted of an &quot;optional seminar&quot;. She added: &quot;It wasn't even suggested we go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two infected nurses have been moved from Texas. Miss Pham has been taken to the US National Institutes of Health outside Washington, while Miss Vinson has been moved to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Texas hospital defended itself against some accusations by Miss Aguirre, and similar ones from the National Nurses United union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: &quot;The assertions do not reflect actual facts learnt from the medical record and interactions with clinical caregivers. Our hospital followed the CDC guidelines and sought additional guidance and clarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC is itself under fire after giving Miss Vinson permission to board a commercial flight despite her having a temperature, a possible symptom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID Cameron said that other European countries &quot;must do more&quot; to stop the spread of Ebola by introducing screening at their airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Prime Minister will today use a summit of European leaders in Italy to push for joint action to &quot;strengthen protection across the board&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Britain, screening has been introduced at Heathrow airport for people from affected countries and next week it will be rolled out at Gatwick and Eurostar. Ministers are considering whether to extend the screening to regional airports and ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date only Britain, France and the Czech Republic have introduced the checks for people travelling from West Africa. Almost every other nation has claimed the checks are unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Cameron's frustration with other European nations emerged from an emergency Cobra meeting yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Number 10 spokesman said: &quot;There was a detailed update about plans for protecting the UK against Ebola. The Health Secretary set out that screening was up and running across all Heathrow terminals and would be in place at Gatwick and St Pancras during the next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a discussion regarding screening across Europe and the Prime Minister made clear other countries needed to do more and introduce their own checks if we are to strengthen protection across the board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concerns came amid criticism of the US response, after a nurse with Ebola was allowed on a flight from Ohio to Texas despite telling officials she had a fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American authorities are trying to track down 132 passengers who were on board with Amber Joy Vinson - who was infected along with a colleague after caring for a patient in Texas. President Barack Obama has cancelled campaigning engagements to focus on the problem, promising a &quot;much more aggressive&quot; approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three people are being tested in Spain, including one who arrived on an Air France jet that was isolated at Madrid airport as a precaution. The man - who had travelled from Nigeria - was taken by ambulance to hospital, with the driver wearing full protective gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another person who came into contact with infected Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero has a high temperature and is being monitored, and a missionary who recently went to Liberia is being tested after developing a fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British Army medics have begun arriving in Sierra Leone to help with the battle against the disease. A team of 91, including nurses, doctors and infectious disease consultants, will join 40 soldiers already in the west African country to work at a UKsupported treatment centre, which has 12 of its 92 beds set aside for healthcare workers who risk infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their deployment comes before the departure of Royal Navy ship RFA Argus, due to reach the area by the end of the month with a further 225 military personnel from a total planned deployment of 750.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation has reported a total of 8,997 cases of Ebola, including 4,493 deaths up to the end of October 12, the vast majority of them in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Downing Street spokesman said a Cobra emergency committee meeting chaired by Mr Cameron heard that the Chief Medical Officer still regarded the risk to the UK as &quot;low&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong US factory output growth and the intervention of a senior American central bank official brought some relief to markets yesterday following three days of turmoil that have knocked billions of pounds off the value of the FTSE 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another day of wild swings in stock prices, James Bullard, hawkish president of the St Louis federal reserve, said the US central bank should consider maintaining its policy of pumping funds into the economy as inflation expectations eased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bullard, an influential member of the central bank's decision-making committee, made his remarks as investors sought havens in German and US bonds, sending the Dow down more than 200 points in early trading and pushing leading shares in London at one point to a year low of 6072. By the close the FTSE was 16 down at 6196, while the Dow ended down 24.5 points at 16,117.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervention and US data showing a monthly 0.5% rise in industrial production triggered a rally that left most stock markets only slightly down on the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global shares have been hard hit by mounting concerns about the prospects for economic growth, Ebola and geopolitical tensions, fears that have also hit the oil price, sending it to a four-year low. Overnight, Asian stock markets had tumbled in reaction to the losses in Europe and the US on Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei losing 2.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.7%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve was expected to end its purchases of bonds under its programme of quantitative easing within a few months as a prelude to a first increase in interest rates. While the economy remains robust, a lack of wage rises has undermined demand on the high street and pushed down prices. Bullard said that to keep consumers spending the Fed should consider maintaining cheap credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note to clients: &quot;The reasons for this new jitteriness are not hard to find with the global economic outlook turning darker, and growth downgrades coming thick and fast from all angles, while concerns about the spread of Ebola are inducing fears about travel bans prompting changes in consumer behaviour across the US.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of job creation in France and Italy and diving business confidence in Germany added to investors' fears. Inflation figures this week showed several countries, including Italy and Sweden, had fallen into deflation, reflecting weakening domestic demand and the impact of sanctions on Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European leaders were forced to pledge their support for Greece amid growing concerns that the country's spiralling debt interest bill endangered its recovery. Greek bond yields, which determine the cost of financing Athens's debt, soared past 9% as weak figures from the eurozone combined with a succession of downwards revisions to global growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European stock markets dived in early trading before rallying late in the afternoon after the strong industrial production numbers from the US. In Germany the Dax closed up 0.4% but France's CAC was down 0.3%. Investors seeking a haven for their cash sent the yield on German 10-year bonds to a new low of 0.718%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend leaders of Greece's fragile coalition had been in Washington to persuade the International Monetary Fund that they should be released from their draconian austerity programme. They told IMF director Christine Lagarde they could prosper without the need for further rescue funds. Days later the suggestion appeared fanciful as reports of a weakening eurozone economy and fractious budget row between Berlin, Paris and Rome undermined investor confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jyrki Katainen, vice-president of the European Union's executive commission, said Greece had made &quot;immense progress&quot; since the euros 240bn (&pound;190bn) rescue started in 2010. &quot;There should be no doubt Europe will continue to assist Greece in whatever way is necessary so the government can keep financing itself,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The further dip in eurozone consumer price inflation in September will clearly be of serious concern to the European Central Bank as it keeps the deflation spectre very much in sight, especially given current stuttering eurozone economic activity and sharply falling oil prices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can tell me if Ebola is the worst plague since, variously, Aids, Sars, BSE or the black death. All I hear is that it &quot;might&quot; be. I do not mind being told no one knows. But what do I make of a prime minister who emerges from his Cobra bunker and declares &quot;a very serious threat to the UK&quot;, a US president who says it is &quot;spiralling out of control&quot;, and a World Health Organisation that says it is &quot;the most severe health emergency seen in modern times . . . a potential threat of an unparalleled human catastrophe&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have lost control of the language of proportion. The result is an outbreak of crying-wolf syndrome. David Cameron and his cabinet currently tell me to be scared witless by Ebola, an attack from Isis, a resurgent Russia and global warming (sometimes). In July, the prime minister said we face being &quot;cast back into the dark ages of medicine&quot; because of a new strain of superbugs. This was capped two months later when Stephen Hawking declared that &quot;the God particle could destroy the universe&quot;. In small print it said this was &quot;very unlikely&quot;, but how unlikely is very?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this all scientific drivel, or merely abuse of the sacred word &quot;could&quot;? We have no tools for assessing such threats. There is no help from the Office for National Statistics or Office for Budget Responsibility. Tim Harford of the BBC Radio 4 programme More or Less tries to keep his head above the sea of tosh. But the only sane response is total scepticism of the motives of those seeking to make us afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real threat from Ebola, the subject of agonising coverage from Africa and panic measures from governments, is hard to assess. It has been around since the 1970s. It was eventually contained each time, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo earlier this year. If governments really thought it so terrifying they would issue a temporary ban on air travel which, in the digital age, is almost all non-essential. But when fear is in the air and politicians want to seem in control, who can tell?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one sure pandemic is panic. In 1997 we were told that bird flu could kill 2 billion people worldwide. In 1999 European Union scientists wailed that the illness BSE/CJD could kill 500,000 people. It peaked at 28 deaths in the UK and is down to two a year. The Sars outbreak of 2003 was asserted by one expert as having &quot;a 25% chance of killing tens of millions&quot;. The press headlined Sars as &quot;a plague worse than Aids&quot;. One Briton possibly died from Sars last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent flus classed as H1N1 and H5N1 seemed to arrive as regularly as swallows in summer. All were eagerly labelled pandemics by scientists, apparently to unlock millions of pounds in government drugs purchases. In 2006, bird flu was declared &quot;the first pandemic of the 21st century&quot; (others not having come up to scratch). The WHO, penetrated by big pharma advisers, issued a statement that &quot;one in four Britons could die&quot;. They did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2009, flu scares were on autopilot. &quot;This could really explode,&quot; a BBC reporter wailed of the latest arrival. &quot;It is here,&quot; cried the London Evening Standard, with fear &quot;spreading like a Mexican wave&quot;. The Department of Health's Sir Liam Donaldson famously declared that &quot;65,000 could die&quot;. Drugs companies such as Roche and GSK were showered with gold, with a staggering $2bn eventually being spent worldwide on Tamiflu. One of the few official bodies to call the scaremongering to account, the Council of Europe, called the hyping of the 2009 pandemic &quot;one of the great medical scandals of the century&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health scares are classics of the politics of fear. After a while they lose all force, except to distort medical priorities. Hundreds died of hospital-caught infections while ministers panicked over bird flu. But what are we to do? As with fear of terrorism, crime, poverty or common illness, we have to rely on authority to advise and warn us. When authority has a vested interest in alarmism, anarchy reigns. We are at the mercy of the lobbyist, the spin doctor and the headline writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lunacies of medical catastrophism are one thing. The political exploitation of personal insecurity is more serious. We can take an aspirin to ward off mad science disease but we cannot altogether dismiss a minister who claims to know our lives and livelihoods are at risk. I expect the police to guard me from danger without constantly telling me what the danger is. Why do politicians behave otherwise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political scientist Louise Richardson wrote in What Terrorists Want that it is precisely what western politicians seem happiest to give them: they want to make us fear them. &quot;By declaring war on terror,&quot; she says, &quot;far from denying al-Qaida its objectives we are conceding its objectives. That is why a war on terror can never be won.&quot; It is a terminological admission of defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear is the dumbing down of politics. After 9/11, Americans were made very afraid of planes. They duly took to their cars and an extra 1,500 died as a result. Privately promoted catastrophe has always had a good press. Bookshops are crammed with titles such as The Long Emergency, The Population Bomb, Our Final Hour. The fact that Aids, predicted to slash by a third Africa's population, has simply not done so, will no more dent the appeal of Armageddon than will the wilder claims of climate changers. The political psychologist Philip Tetlock famously gathered 28,000 predictions from scientists and other experts, then waited and found they were no better than random guesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the answer is to take a leaf from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The government should appoint a commission for the assessment of panics. Its job would be to test alarmist announcements against stringent statistical probability. If a budget can be independently audited and crime figures independently scrutinised, why not Downing Street scaremongering?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the real risk of thousands dying of flu or being blown up by terrorists? Should we be very scared, seriously scared or scared out of our minds? What force should these words convey to the body politic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My commission would test for the abuse of words such as &quot;could&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;up to&quot;, as in &quot;Isis terrorism could threaten up to a thousand lives&quot;, or &quot;superbugs could take us back to the dark ages&quot;. The new press regulator, Ipso, would do likewise for that equal offender, the media. Penalties would be harsh, such as a year's course in regression analysis and probability theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A democracy must know what it should fear. Perhaps young people who did not know the cold war threat of nuclear annihilation are more susceptible to the phoney scaremongering of today. Either way, it lays them open to lobbyists and cynics. Freedom from fear is a human right. We pay politicians to guard us from terror by not terrifying us.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operator of the Texas hospital in which two nurses contracted Ebola has apologised for initially failing to diagnose the patient who infected them and for misinforming the public about how it happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer at Texas Health Resources, conceded that errors were made by Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, which sent Thomas Duncan home after he complained of a fever and abdominal pain after his arrival from his native Liberia last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr Duncan, despite our best intentions and highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes,&quot; Varga wrote in testimony to the US Congress. &quot;We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan died on 8 October, a week after he became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, and two weeks since he first sought treatment at the hospital. Two nurses involved in his care - Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29 - have since been diagnosed with the virus, raising serious questions about the hospital's procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas Health initially explained its failure to diagnose Duncan, who did not have health insurance, by saying a nurse had not shared the patient's travel records with a doctor. It has subsequently retracted that statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had advised hospitals to consider Ebola when diagnosing people suffering from a fever after travelling to countries affected by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the hospital operator said questions over Duncan's ability to pay had no impact on his treatment, adding that he had been cared for and prescribed antibiotics. Duncan returned to the hospital in an ambulance three days later and eventually died in an isolation unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varga wrote in his testimony: &quot;In our effort to communicate to the public quickly and transparently, we inadvertently provided some information that was inaccurate and had to be corrected.&quot; He conceded that had been &quot;unsettling to a community that was already concerned and confused&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor, a senior executive vice president for the hospital's operator, said he and his colleagues &quot;don't yet know precisely how or when&quot; Pham was infected with Ebola as she was &quot;using full protective measures under CDC protocols&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Nurses United union criticised Texas Health for Duncan's care after medical records suggested staff worked in the quarantine unit with their skin exposed during the three days between the patient's admission and his diagnosis. They alleged other failings in protective clothing and the isolation of Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Were protocols breached? The nurses say there were no protocols,&quot; the union's co-president, Deborah Burger, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the hospital replied: &quot;The assertions do not reflect actual facts learned from the medical record and interactions with clinical caregivers. Our hospital followed the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and sought additional guidance and clarity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital said Duncan was admitted to the emergency room and swiftly placed in isolation after he arrived for the second time. But the union, quoting the nurses, had said he had waited for hours in a room with other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital said staff wore appropriate personal protective equipment as recommended by the CDC at the time, including shoe covers and face shields. It said it kept up with the CDC's evolving guidelines on protective equipment: &quot;When the CDC issued updates, as they did with leg covers, we followed their guidelines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union said the caregivers who initially treated Duncan were woefully underprotected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the New York Times, Varga explained what he believed led to Duncan's misdiagnosis on his initial visit, in which he was interviewed, examined and sent home with a high fever and a course of antibiotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varga said he believed a nurse didn't ask for Duncan's travel history until two hours after his arrival. The nurse reported that Duncan had travelled from west Africa, but she, according to Varga, did not communicate that to the treating physician who interviewed the Liberian man 10 minutes later. The doctor came away with the impression Duncan was a local resident; Varga could not explain why that was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varga said workers did not wear full biohazard suits during the critical three-day window before Duncan's diagnosis was confirmed. He said staff wore masks, gloves, gowns and shields in accordance with CDC protocols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 77 healthcare workers believed to have worked in the quarantine room or handled samples of Duncan's blood are being monitored for symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varga said in his testimony the staff had been separated into three categories based on their level of risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at highest risk have been told to stay off work and not use public transport. They are required to remain in the county where they live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his written testimony to the subcommittee, before a hearing yesterday, the CDC director, Dr Thomas Frieden, said the nurses' infections &quot;demonstrate the need to strengthen the procedures for infection-control protocols &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged on Wednesday that after suffering a fever, Vinson had asked the CDC whether she should take a flight to Ohio, where she was to spend time with family. She had been told to proceed because her temperature of 99.5F (37.5C) fell below the CDC threshold of 100.4F.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CDC officials have since acknowledged that she should not have flown on a commercial plane. Last night a spokesman for the CDC said that Vinson who was going to Ohio to prepare for her wedding may have been ill as early as last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven people in north-east Ohio entered voluntary quarantine - despite having no symptoms - after confirmed contact with Vinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frieden sought to allay public fears over the virus. He said he and his colleagues &quot;remain confident that Ebola is not a significant public health threat to the United States&quot; thanks primarily to its not being easily transmitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vinson was transferred from Dallas to a special bio-containment unit in Atlanta on Wednesday night. Varga, who gave no update about Vinson's condition, said: &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, President Barack Obama authorised the Pentagon to call up reserve and National Guard troops if they are needed to assist in the US response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola epidemic, which is out of control in three countries and directly threatening 15 others, may not end until the world has a vaccine against the disease, according to one of the scientists who discovered the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it would not have been difficult to contain the outbreak if those on the ground and the UN had acted promptly earlier this year. &quot;Something that is easy to control got completely out of hand,&quot; said Piot, who was part of a team that identified the causes of the first outbreak of Ebola in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1976 and helped bring it to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of the epidemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea means that isolation, care, and tracing and monitoring contacts, which have worked before, will not halt the spread. &quot;It may be that we have to wait for a vaccine to stop the epidemic,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piot was speaking as Dr Tom Frieden, director of the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), was interrogated by Republican politicians in Washington DC, who wanted explanations for his staff granting permission for Amber Vinson, a nurse who has now tested positive for the Ebola virus, to board a plane even though she had a slightly raised temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not know exactly what was said, but she did contact our agency and she did board the plane,&quot; said Frieden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a Downing Street spokesman said a meeting of the government's emergency response committee, Cobra, was told the chief medical officer still believed the risk to the UK remained low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frieden said he was confident the outbreak would be checked in the US, but stressed the need to halt the raging west African epidemic. &quot;There are no shortcuts in the control of Ebola and it is not easy to control it. To protect the United States we need to stop it at its source,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things I fear about Ebola is that it could spread more widely in Africa. If this were to happen it could become a threat to our health system and the healthcare we give for a long time to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three vaccines are now being fast-tracked through early safety trials in volunteers in the UK, the US and in unaffected Mali to ensure that they do no harm. If they are acceptable, it is likely healthcare workers - who are at highest risk of being infected and more than 200 of whom have died - will be offered a vaccination before Christmas. But the only proof that any of them works will be if there is a significant drop in the number of deaths among vaccinated people on the frontline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the epidemic is not going to be stopped in these three countries, it will definitely spread to adjacent countries such as Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau and Mali,&quot; said Piot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at a seminar in Oxford as the World Health Organisation warned that 15 countries, neighbouring or trading with those where the epidemic is raging, were at risk. They are Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Gambia, Ghana, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Sudan and Togo. Nigeria and Senegal have both succeeded in halting an outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the WHO said all needed to be better prepared. &quot;The objective is to stop the transmission from occurring in these countries. They may have a case, but after one case we don't want more cases,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the week, she predicted, the number of cases will have risen to over 9,000, with more than 4,500 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piot said: &quot;It could lead to major destabilisation of societies and also political destabilisation. It is going to come at a very high cost. Some countries are very vulnerable. The economic impact is already enormous - just as Sars a decade ago only killed 700, but the economic impact was tens of billions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My concern is that, as so often after a war or crisis, we say never again and then we forget about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of Ebola to Ivory Coast and Ghana could cause major disruption to cocoa production, sending prices skywards. Cocoa prices have already hit three-year highs amid rising global demand for chocolate and fears that Ebola will spread to Ivory Coast and Ghana - which produce about 60% of the world's cocoa - from neighbouring Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cocoa prices have been rising over the year so far, when the cost of most agricultural commodities has fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, where almost 1,200 people have died from Ebola, 40% of farmers have abandoned their fields, said Joseph Sam Sesay, minister of agriculture, forestry and food security. The region where coffee and cocoa - accounting for 90% of the country's agricultural exports - is grown has been hit hard by the virus. Sesay said: &quot;Farms have been abandoned. Some families have been wiped away. Some villages have been wiped away. It is very serious . . . agriculture is the mainstay of our economies - if agriculture is down our economies will be down.&quot; Angela Monaghan</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collapse of the company raises fears about international efforts to combat Ebola, which has claimed about 4,500 lives in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London Mining is building a 130-bed Ebola treatment centre near Lunsar, 60 miles east of Freetown, and has donated Le 709m (&pound;103,000) to Sierra Leone's efforts to fight the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also fears about the increased risk to London Mining's staff if the mine seizes operations. At present, all staff have their temperature checked twice a day, and medical staff are on hand to address any concerns. None of the company's employees have yet contracted the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London Mining and its administrators said they would do all they could to keep the mine going while they search for a buyer, but said &quot;although at this time this is not confirmed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Desjardins, London Mining's managing director, who has been central to coordinating efforts to fight the spread of Ebola, said on 8 October: &quot;We are part of this community and this nation. A strengthened healthcare system is essential for safeguarding the health of our employees and our host communities .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe it is our duty to provide what help we can to stem the spread of this disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavily-indebted company, which has been pushed to the brink by collapsing iron prices combined with the difficulty of working through the Ebola crisis, is one of Sierra Leone's biggest employers and contributes about 10% of the nation's GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administrator, PwC, said the company has already held &quot;advanced discussions&quot; with several potential buyers, and &quot;it is hoped these discussions will mean that a sale of Marampa can now be concluded quickly, with operations continuing and the workforce protected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell Downs, joint administrator and partner at PwC said: &quot;The collapse in iron ore prices and the resulting impacts on this business have been very dramatic. Our focus is to ensure that a buyer is found for the Marampa mine operations given it is such an important part of the Sierra Leone economy. We are liaising with key stakeholders and asking for a short window of forbearance as we look to conclude a transaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graeme Hossie, London Mining's chief executive, said: &quot;I salute all our employees for their dedication and contribution in creating what is now an important part of Sierra Leone's economy and ongoing development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also applaud them for the ongoing leadership role our team has played within the private sector in Sierra Leone in helping address the challenges of the current Ebola crisis. The Marampa mine retains excellent fundamentals and it is our sincere wish for it to find the appropriate financial support to continue operating over the longer term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London Mining, which has been operating in Sierra Leone since 2005, suspended trading in its shares on 10 October after warning that it did not have enough cash to continue to run the mine. The shares, which had traded above &pound;4 in 2011, were suspended at 0.75p valuing the company at just &pound;1m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential buyers for the company include India's third-largest steelmaker, JSW Steel, and Frank Timis, the founder of African Minerals, which owns a neighbouring mine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lost in Showbiz likes to think of itself as a paragon of modesty and shy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understatement. It would never seek to self-aggrandise by claiming that it exerts a vast influence over the world of celebrity, that the famous hang on its every word, looking to it for guidance much as they would a guru or oracle, regarding its pronouncements as wisdom, spun from the purest gold, there to be acted upon with alacrity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sometimes, it does wonder. Last week, Lost in Showbiz found itself forced to berate the world's celebrities for their woefully inadequate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">response to the Ebola outbreak. It noted sorrowfully that, to date, hardly anyone from the glittering showbiz firmament had done or said anything idiotic. Apparently forgetting themselves - and the vital role they're supposed to play in any crisis - they had chosen to make a sober black and white fundraising video. Clearly panicked and desperate, people had taken matters into their own hands and resorted to making idiotic things up, about R&amp;B singer Akon performing in a giant plastic anti-Ebola bubble etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the celebrities Lost in Showbiz called upon to act was R&amp;B's best-loved domestic abuser Chris Brown, a man who suggested the 2011 riots might be quelled if people listened to his recent collaboration with pop-house DJ Benny Benassi, Beautiful People. It's delighted to report that no sooner were its admonishing words published than a suitably chastened Chris Brown took to Twitter and informed his 13.7 million followers that, in his considered opinion, the Ebola epidemic was, in fact, &quot;a form of population control&quot;. No word, alas, as to whether he meant that it was the judgment of God upon an over-populated world or a crisis engineered by shadowy operatives of The Man - just the suggestion that &quot;shit is getting crazy&quot; - but let's not pick nits here. Let us instead offer profound thanks that at least one celebrity has started doing their job properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the only drawback to the situation was that, 9,500 retweets later, Brown suggested he was going to &quot;shut up&quot;. No, Chris Brown! Don't shut up! At the moment, you're our only hope! Indeed, at risk of abusing its position as your guru or oracle Lost in Showbiz commands you to say more stupid things! Have you any thoughts on the advance of Islamic State?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The venue for next year's Africa Cup of Nations finals is in doubt after the proposed hosts, Morocco, reiterated its fears over the Ebola outbreak on the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Confederation of African Football (Caf) received a letter from the Moroccan government last week asking for the tournament to be called off and had agreed to discuss the plans at the next executive committee meeting on 2 November. The prospective hosts proposed either postponing the tournament or allowing them to switch to the 2017 edition instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite reports on the African website supersport.com which quoted a source from the country's ministry of sport claiming that Morocco has now officially withdrawn to &quot;preserve the safety of our citizens&quot;, the sports minister, Mohamed Ouzzine, moved to clarify the situation on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our concern is the health of Africa and, based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,&quot; Ouzzine said. &quot;One has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast. But given the current Ebola situation we don't think such a feast can take place as expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are talking about the Africa Cup of Nations where we are expecting between 200,000 and 400,000, even one million spectators to converge in Morocco. I don't think there is any state or any country that has the necessary capabilities to monitor, check and control the current Ebola situation when faced with these numbers. We don't have a problem with visiting teams, we have a problem with visitors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2013 hosts South Africa are now tipped to take over after reports that the country's Football Association was already in negotiations with Caf, although Sudan and Egypt have also expressed an interest in hosting the tournament. Ghana's sports minister, Mahama Ayariga, confirmed they are also considering a request from Caf to take over hosting duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco's withdrawal could lead to sanctions from the governing body, with potential punishments including the suspension of their national teams and clubs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As America's health authorities warned about the spread of the disease, an alarming slump on the London Stock Market was followed in by a dramatic dip on Wall Street.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of shareholders, including the big pension funds, were left with heavy losses last night after stocks fell wiping as much as &pound;46billion off the value of Britain's biggest listed companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE100 index of leading shares in London tumbled by as much as 2.8 per cent or 181 points, lower at 6211.6, its biggest plunge in a day for a year. It has lost 10 per cent in the last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.64 per cent or 267.31 points to 16047.88 in late afternoon in the US after plunging as much as 450 points earlier in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a terrible day for world markets the spread of Ebola combined with a raft of negative developments caused what dealers described as a perfect storm. In the US, the fall in the Dow gathered momentum after the US Center for Disease Control said it was not clear how a second worker had contracted the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials have said they also don't know how the first health worker, a nurse, became infected. The Federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention said an additional health care worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears over a political crisis in bailed-out Greece and gloom over the outlook for the American economy caused investors to cut their losses and sell. Markets were also spooked by disappointment after stagnation in the eurozone, a slowdown in China and unexpected falls in the global oil price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: Carnage on the markets today as European markets hit by a perfect storm of disappointment over the health of the economy in Europe?...?as well as Ebola.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In France the Cac was down 3.25 per cent while in Germany the Dax fell 2.5 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&divide; Ebola survivor Will Pooley has said he is preparing to go back to west Africa to help deal with the epidemic because it is something I need to do'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteer nurse, from Eyke in Suffolk, said there was a urgent need for strong medical support as the virus has claimed almost 4,500 lives, mainly in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pooley, 29, made a special appearance at a training and discussion session in Whitehall for NHS workers who have volunteered to help on the ground with the international effort.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The international response to the Ebola crisis, highlighted by the United Nations, lacks common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are two distinct facets to the control of the disease. The first, which is being addressed, is the treatment and prevention of the spread of disease within the west African countries. The second, and more important, is to prevent the disease becoming a worldwide pandemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only credible policy is to isolate the three countries with closed borders until the disease is brought under control. This interim period would allow the immigration services to implement a policy of stamping exiting passports with a World Health Organisation logo plus the date, allowing destination airports to clearly identify individuals from this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These international travellers would be brought under a public health remit with further screening and medical advice without the farrago that is occurring at airports such as Heathrow today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A G Murphy London EC4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - In my youth we were quarantined for infectious diseases. Is it because it contravenes human rights that we are not suggesting infected areas be quarantined and that people do not travel from those areas?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Ebola's incubation period of, I understand, up to three weeks, there seems little point in spending a fortune putting any screening into practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; OPINION, COLUMNS; Pg. 25</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to hitting precise targets, Britain's Armed Forces areas good as any, and often better. RAF fighters firing Storm Shadow missiles can hit the mark from more than 300 miles away. The Royal Navy's Harpoon missile can strike an enemy vessel 80 miles over the horizon. Army snipers using the L115A3 long-range rifle in Afghanistan have routinely killed at distances of more than a mile. Yet a viral particle of Ebola, measuring just a couple of millionths of a millimetre across, is a target beyond the accuracy of even these weapons. You can't shoot a disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, Ebola has become the latest enemy for Britain's military. Tomorrow, Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus sets sail for Sierra Leone in Operation Gritrock, Britain's 400-man mission to slow the spread of the virus across west Africa. Elsewhere in the region, 4,000 US soldiers are deploying with a similar aim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why send troops on what is essentially a medical mission? People familiar with crisis-management work say it's not just about their clinical skills, although military medics are certainly among the best. What the Forces really bring to a situation like this is reassurance. When the world around you is dissolving into chaos, the presence of unflappable men and women in uniform is a handy antidote to panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But using the Armed Forces for humanitarian missions highlights a more fundamental question: what are they now for? After years of casualties and controversy in Iraq and Afghanistan, defence chiefs and politicians agree that the British public's appetite for foreign wars is at an almost subterranean low. Once the 13-year Afghan mission ends in a few weeks, no one expects Britain to fight a large-scale ground-based campaign for many years: our involvement against Isil in Iraq has been very carefully limited to RAF patrols and a handful of Special Forces soldiers. Parliament is reluctant even to allow a couple of jets to cross the Iraqi border into Syrian airspace, in order to target people who are hacking the heads off our fellow citizens. Goodness knows what it would take for politicians to authorise the deployment of thousands of British soldiers on to a foreign field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So if we're not going to fight wars abroad, why have Forces that still cost more than &pound;36 billion a year? The obvious answer is &quot;defence&quot;, but defence against what? There are no conventional threats to Britain's territory or domestic interests. The French only invade with bankers, not battalions. Any Russian threat comes via espionage and the energy markets, not tanks and troops. Chinese aggression could yet spark an old-fashioned hot war around the Pacific, but only the US has the capacity to truly participate there; Beijing is still years away from being able to project military power as far as our own neighbourhood. As Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute concludes, &quot;the risk to the UK of head-to-head conflict with peer competitors is likely to remain relatively small for the next decade or so&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But peace could spell financial trouble for the Armed Forces. Britain's fiscal crisis is far from over, meaning there are more cuts to come after the next election. With the biggest items of spending - the NHS and state pension - politically protected, every other part of the state can expect yet more pain. Britain is very likely soon to be spending less than 2 per cent of its GDP on defence, the minimum requirement for membership of Nato. Yet funding for international aid will remain above 0.7 per cent, held aloft by political consensus and - soon - a legal commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving less to defence and more to foreign aid is perennially controversial. Listen to some critics of expanding the aid budget, and you might think abandoning the pledge would fund half a dozen new aircraft carriers. In fact, even after its recent increases, the aid budget is just over &pound;11 billion, around 1.5 per cent of total expenditure. Not quite the pot of gold that some imagine - but in the age of austerity, every little helps, and defence chiefs have certainly been eyeing the aid budget hungrily for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quietly, the line between aid and defence spending is indeed blurring a little. The RAF aid drops for Yazidi civilians fleeing Isil in Iraq were largely funded by the Department for International Development. Likewise, Operation Gritrock. And never having come to terms with their leader's commitment to development spending, many Tories are keen to promise greater pooling of the two budgets in their manifesto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are limits to that ambition, however. Which spending counts towards the 0.7 per cent target is decided not by the Government, but the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a rich-country think tank. Its definition of development aid is curious: building nuclear power plants and art schools overseas counts as aid, but clearing minefields to allow military training does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain is fighting a lonely battle for more military activity to be designated as overseas aid - but realistically, the only way for the Services to get more development cash is to do more development work. Privately, even modern-minded officers bridle at the suggestion that the Armed Forces must become the &quot;armed wing of DfiD&quot;. But in the absence of war, and public money, the arguments for using soldiers as aid workers can only grow. Perhaps, by taking on new enemies like disease, famine and even poverty, our soldiers can not only save some lives, but save themselves from the Treasury's axe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN EBOLA outbreak in America moved closer yesterday when a second Dallas nurse tested positive for the disease a day after she took a flight from Ohio to Texas through two international airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama was forced to cancel a campaign trip to hold an emergency Ebola summit at the White House amid growing condemnation of the chaotic federal response to the arrival of the disease in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He discussed the outbreak earlier in a video conference with David Cameron, and their German, French and Italian counterparts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nurses' leaders condemned what they alleged were alarming safety breaches at the Dallas hospital at the centre of the crisis, alleging that a Liberian man who later died of the disease was left in a waiting room with other patients, and health workers treated him with inadequate protective gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amber Vinson became the second nurse from Dallas Presbyterian Hospital to be diagnosed with Ebola after caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, who died there last week. About 75 other members of the medical team are being monitored for signs of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Vinson is to be airlifted to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta where Ebola experts have successfully treated other patients who contracted the disease in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Vinson told authorities that she had flown from Cleveland back to the Texas city on Monday, the day before she became ill, through airports used by tens of thousands of passengers each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other passengers on the Frontier Airlines flight were being contacted by health officials and given a hotline number to call. Doctors said Miss Vinson was reportedly not showing symptoms of the disease on the plane, so there should be no risk of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials claimed that she broke monitoring guidelines when she flew to Ohio and back to Texas after treating Mr Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medical staff who cared for him were not supposed to take commercial flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama convened the White House summit after officials at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that a faster and more concerted federal response to Mr Duncan's case could have prevented the infection of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nina Pham, 26, another nurse, is said to be in a &quot;good condition&quot; after becoming the first person to contract the disease in America after also helping to care for Mr Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hospital was criticised by some of its own nurses in an extraordinary statement issued anonymously by one of the country's main nursing unions. &quot;Were the protocols breached?&quot; asked Deborah Burger, a co-president of the union, National Nurses United. &quot;The nurses say there were no protocols.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Duncan was initially sent home from the hospital, despite arriving at the emergency room with symptoms of the disease and disclosing that he had recently arrived from Liberia where he had contact with an Ebola victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nurses' statement claimed even when Mr Duncan arrived back seriously ill by ambulance he was not put into isolation for several hours, but left in a waiting area with other patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nurses who first dealt with him wore gowns, gloves with no taping around the wrists, and surgical masks with the option of a shield, the statement claimed, leaving their necks exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement alleged that hospital officials allowed nurses who dealt with Mr Duncan at a time when he was vomiting and had diarrhoea to continue to care for other patients &quot;even though they had not had the proper personal protective equipment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials at the hospital said they would review concerns raised by the nurses but defended their efforts to &quot;provide a safe working environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears of a worldwide economic slowdown and anxiety about the spread of Ebola reverberated around stock markets yesterday, driving shares on both sides of the Atlantic sharply down and pushing the price of oil to a four-year low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 closed down 181 points or 2.8% at 6,211, knocking &pound;46bn off the value of Britain's top companies. This was its lowest level and biggest one-day fall since June last year. It was also close to a 10% decline from its recent peak on</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped sharply after European markets closed, slumping 420 points - 2.5% - and dipping below 16,000 before rebounding to 16,141. Its recent high was 17,265, reached on 18 September, the day before the record-breaking float of Alibaba, the vast Chinese internet business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vix volatility index, also known as the &quot;fear index&quot;, which is linked to the outlook for the American S&amp;P 500 index, jumped by 22% to 31.06 before dropping back to 26.25, up 15% on the previous day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe the picture was the same. Germany's Dax dropped 2.87% while France's Cac was down 3.63%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catalyst for the renewed market turmoil was data indicating the US economy was being affected by a global fall in demand. US retail sales fell 0.3% in September, the first decline since January, and worse than the 0.1% decline expected, while producer prices fell by 0.1%, the first decline since August 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Empire manufacturing report for New York slumped to 6.17 this month, from 20.5 in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US updates followed weaker than expected inflation data from China, with the consumer prices index there hitting a near five-year low and prompting fears of a slowdown unless the central bank acted to revive the country's slowing economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As global slowdown fears grew, oil slumped to a new four-year low, down 0.34% at $84.75 a barrel, with Opec unwilling to cut supplies even with demand faltering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stagnating eurozone economy has also been in the spotlight, in particular Germany, where the government this week cut its growth forecasts for the next two years after growing signs that the country could slide into recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday Greece seemed to be heading for a new political crisis and there were also concerns about the outcome of the European banking stress tests. The test results are due to be published at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geopolitical tensions - including the protests in Hong Kong, the turmoil in the Middle East and the spread of Ebola, with another case reported in Texas - have also unsettled the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Greece the Athens market was down on fears of new political turmoil as the country struggles to put its economy back on track. A survey this week showed the Syriza party, which opposes the country's bailout, had moved ahead of the government and prompted talk of an election early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greek 10-year bond yields soared by more than 80 basis points to 7.85%, their highest since February, threatening the country's funding plans and its attempts to leave its bailout programme early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flood of cheap money supplied by central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, which has been propping up the market for a number of years, is beginning to be turned off. The Fed is due to end its monthly bond buying programme at the end of October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopes that Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, would implement a concerted bond-buying programme to support the flagging eurozone economy were being dashed by opposition from Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the currency markets the dollar lost ground as analysts said the poor US figures meant it was unlikely the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in the immediate future. But as investors sought havens, gold rose $10 to $1243 an ounce, while UK bonds were also in demand. Ten-year gilt yields fell to 2.055%, reaching their lowest level since June 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Madden, a market analyst at IG, said: &quot;The spike in the Greek 10-year yield and the sudden collapse in the equity markets seems all too familiar, and it looks like we are entering another phase of the eurozone debt crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henk Potts, director of global research at Barclays, said: &quot;The stock market is in fear mode at the moment (over) worries about global growth conditions and normalisation of US interest rates. But if the sell-off continues it could prove to be a strong entry point into an asset class that we think will continue to outperform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's stance has appeared to rule out the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi, left, launching a bond buying scheme to prop up the eurozone</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the world has rightly focused on the response to the terrible outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, and the new cases in Europe and the US, another unrelated Ebola outbreak has taken place in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It began in August in the village of Ikanamongo and, as with all other outbreaks, was triggered when the Ebola virus crossed the species barrier between animals and humans and infected one person before spreading to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is thought that the first person to contract the virus in Ikanamongo was a woman, infected while butchering wild game to cook for a family meal. The outbreak caused around 70 infections and 43 deaths. But, unlike in West Africa, the last known case occurred around three weeks ago and the outbreak will likely soon be declared fully contained by the World Health Organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today's globalised world, it is almost certain there will be more Ebola cases reaching Europe and the US - despite the airport screening programme launched this week in several countries. Given this, and the fact that current estimates predict the rate of infection will rise to 10,000 cases per week by December, it is vital that the lessons of how to defeat Ebola are learned quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the DRC outbreak was reported to health officials in Kinshasa, the response was rapid - a team that had contained numerous outbreaks in the past was brought in. It was headed by Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a professor of microbiology and now director of the DRC National Institute of Biomedical Research, who was the first medic to arrive in Yambuku when the first known outbreak occurred in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team has contained more than 10 outbreaks in the country and, with others in countries such as Uganda, has demonstrated that a rapid and robust response can stop rural outbreaks before they spread to major urban areas and across international borders. In fact, in 1995 the DRC team prevented a potential outbreak in Kinshasa, the capital city with a population of 9 million, when a patient from an outbreak in Kikwit, five hours away by road, made his way to a hospital there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at Kikwit that the three basic public health strategies to prevent Ebola outbreaks were tested and proven. They are: rapid identification and isolation of those with the Ebola infection in controlled health facilities where workers are protected; tracing everyone who has been in contact with an infected person and monitoring their temperature for 21 days, with those who develop the Ebola fever isolated at a health facility; and helping local people understand how to protect themselves while providing safe patient transport and burial, and working with village chiefs and elders to help quell rumours about the origins of disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what has gone wrong in the current tragic outbreak in West Africa? First, by the time the rural infection was reported it had spread to several communities and the initial response was not robust enough to contain it. Now, urban areas are affected, where community organisation is less structured and effective, and where trust in government is low because of recent civil conflict. At the same time, the health system has collapsed in several areas where health workers have been infected, making it a challenge to ensure patients are isolated from their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is essential that as many lives as possible are saved while attempts to stop the outbreak are under way. New and innovative ways are already being found to compensate for the weakened public health systems in the three most affected countries. In Sierra Leone, people were confined to their homes for a three-day period. This was controversial: would there be facilities to isolate patients who were identified; would there be burial teams to carry away the dead? But it was accomplished without the dire consequences predicted by many outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other innovations might include modifying community care centres so they can be used for Ebola patients - especially important in providing diagnosis, treatment and isolation of patients whose numbers have surpassed available hospital beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support from international partners is rapidly increasing in West Africa and this is essential for success, even though President Obama declared this week that the world &quot;is not doing enough&quot; to combat the disease. But it is important to remember the lessons from Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. When a major cholera outbreak occurred, the international response was generous, but much of the coordination was ineffective, resulting in duplication of effort, while gaps in the essential response remained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the early lack of coordination in West Africa, and despite declarations that this outbreak is more difficult to contain because of poverty, recent civil disturbance and war, there is no time for excuses. With support from the UN, government efforts must be strengthened. The errors made in Haiti must not now recur in West Africa, where every day lives continue to be lost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's Centres for Disease and Control Prevention was attempting to contact 132 passengers who flew on a plane with a second healthcare worker who has tested positive for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Vinson, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, was immediately isolated after reporting a fever on Tuesday. She had treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient in the US to die from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC said that Vinson had flown on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas on 13 October, the day before she reported Ebola symptoms. The flight was the last one of the evening, and the plane was cleaned in Dallas according to normal procedures, which the airline said meets CDC guidelines, before being used again the next day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline crew said the patient exhibited no symptoms during the flight; however, the CDC is asking all 132 passengers to contact the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama cancelled a campaign trip yesterday and convened his cabinet at the White House instead. Afterwards he warned the US public not to lose sight of the importance of focusing on tackling the disease at its source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As pressure grows on the White House to explain failures to prevent the second case of transmission within the US, the president also announced a &quot;rapid response Swat team&quot; from the CDC would aim to respond to any further infections within 24 hours &quot;to take local hospitals step by step through what needs to be done&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am absolutely confident that we can prevent a serious outbreak of the disease here in the United States, but it becomes more difficult to do so if this epidemic of Ebola rages out of control in west Africa. If it does, then it will spread globally in an age of frequent travel and the kind of constant interactions that people have across borders,&quot; he told reporters after the emergency two-hour meeting of his cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very important for us to understand that the investment we make in helping Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea deal with this problem is an investment in our own public health. This is not simply charity . . . It is also probably the single most important thing we can do to prevent a more serious Ebola outbreak in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed that though protecting healthcare workers was a top priority, the risks of transmission should not be overstated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to use myself as an example so people have a sense of the science here. I shook hands with, hugged and kissed (not the doctors) but a couple of the nurses at Emory because of the valiant work that they did in treating one of the patients. The followed the protocols, they knew what they were doing and I felt perfectly safe doing so. This is not a situation like the flu where the risks of a rapid spread of the disease are imminent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's decision to postpone the trip, just a few hours before Air Force One was scheduled to depart, reflected the urgency facing the administration amid the American public's escalating concerns about the potential spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second infection also calls into question the Dallas hospital's ability to protect staff treating Ebola patients, and raises concerns about the quality of the initial response to Duncan's diagnosis. The CDC admitted before the latest announcement that it should have sent a bigger team to Dallas in the wake of Duncan's diagnosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may get worse before it gets better,&quot; said Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings at a press briefing yesterday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An additional healthcare worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern, and the CDC has already taken active steps to minimise the risk to healthcare workers and the patient,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 77-person team that cared for Duncan, two nurses have so far tested positive for Ebola. Public health officials are still monitoring the other 75 who may have had contact with Duncan or his blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, officials are also monitoring 48 people who had or may have had direct contact with Duncan before he was admitted to an isolation unit on 28 September. The group has nearly reached the end of the disease's 21-day incubation period - most people exposed to the disease develop symptoms after eight to 10 days. Thomas Frieden, the director of the CDC, said on Tuesday it would be &quot;unusual&quot; for these contacts, all of whom are asymptomatic, to develop Ebola at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse, 26-year-old Nina Pham, was the first person to have been infected with Ebola in the US, and was diagnosed at the weekend. She had cared for Duncan during much of his 11 days as a patient at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital said on Tuesday that Pham was in good condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the CDC said it was establishing a rapid-response team to help hospitals &quot;hands on, within hours&quot; whenever there was a confirmed case of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frieden conceded the agency should have been more hands-on with the hospital.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A radio presenter from Sierra Leone who had been broadcasting a myth-busting show about Ebola in his home country was refused accommodation when he arrived to study at the University of East Anglia this month because landlords feared he may have brought the killer virus with him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amara Bangura, 35, from the capital Freetown, has told the BBC he was refused lodgings by two separate landlords who had been happy to rent him accommodation in Norwich until they saw his passport and found out he was from one of the worst-hit Ebola hotspots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcaster, who had used his weekly radio show in Sierra Leone to dispel myths about the disease, said he was devastated to be turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very unreasonable,&quot; he told the BBC. &quot;And if you think everybody coming from Sierra Leone is affected, then that's just completely unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the landlords reportedly told him in a refusal letter: &quot;Under normal circumstance(s) your profile would be a great profile to be one of our lodgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, given that the world is about to probably experience an Ebola epidemic, we have decided not to accept anyone that has been anywhere near the outbreak within the last two months, or is likely to visit those areas in the near future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangura has now found a place to stay and has given a presentation on the Ebola outbreak in Africa to students at the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior officer at the UEA students' union said the landlords' behaviour was &quot;absolutely disgusting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holly Staynor, welfare, community and diversity officer at the union, said: &quot;There is no way we should be discriminating against any students.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangura's show is networked to 35 stations across the west African country through BBC Media Action, and aims to educate, inform and warn listeners about the disease. He told the Guardian last week: &quot;You have to deal with the issues of myth, you have to deal with the issues of religion, you have to answer questions about prevention and how to stay safe&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, while on an assessment mission to a village 45 miles from Freetown that had been placed in isolation, John Crisci, the UN World Food Programme's (WFP) emergency co-ordinator for Sierra Leone, came across a quarantined house guarded by soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Behind them on the patio, covered with a coloured cotton sheet, were two sisters, probably about two and nine years old,&quot; he says. &quot;One was face up and one was face down. Their mother was there on the patio, keeping a distance of a couple of metres. She was looking over at them and you could see that she was desperate and hopeless . . . she couldn't do anything to comfort them. She kept on looking out at the road hoping that the ambulance was coming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We intervened heavily but, unfortunately, one of the little girls passed away. The other sister is in a treatment centre now and we hear her chances are slim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation, was blunt on Ebola's terrible capacity to destabilise communities and institutions. &quot;I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries,&quot; she said. &quot;I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of Ebola in Sierra Leone is affecting life at every level: classrooms are empty, health clinics are swamped, people are going hungry and even the legal system is not immune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday AdvocAid, an NGO that works with women and children in detention in Sierra Leone, was called on to help a woman threatened with prison for her behaviour outside a Freetown hospital. The woman, angry at being told to wash her hands for the 11th time that day, had refused to use one of the ubiquitous buckets of chlorinated water before entering the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unmoved by her claims that she had heard repeated contact with chlorine could give you cancer, the police arrested her. An AdvocAid paralegal managed to get her off with a fine of 50,000 leones (&pound;7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as being an overreaction, says AdvocAid's executive director, Simitie Lavaly, the police response was not the best use of time and resources. Since Ebola broke out in the west African country in May it has left Sierra Leone's justice system under severe strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very few lawyers are going to court because some are scared about coming into contact with infected people and others feel it's not worth their while financially,&quot; she says. &quot;There are not many judges because a lot of them are stranded outside the country after they went abroad for the high court summer recess. The flights were cancelled and they can't come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The few magistrates still sitting, she adds, are struggling to balance the demands of justice with the logistics of emergency public health declarations forbidding large gatherings. &quot;Before, they'd hear 30 cases a day,&quot; says Lavaly. &quot;Now they don't hear more than 10 because if you have more cases, you have more people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With visits from family suspended in an effort to limit infection, it is left to the NGOs to bring food to mothers detained with children, and to top up the prisons' ever-dwindling supplies of chlorine, buckets and gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also bring in a bit of cassava for people, because a lot of time they complain that they don't have enough food,&quot; says Lavaly. &quot;And God forbid, if you get Ebola, your immune system needs the food - not to mention oral rehydration solution. Even without Ebola, there are a lot of malnourished prisoners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is most needed, argues Lavaly, is international help in bringing a swift end to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of us lived through the war,&quot; she says. &quot;It feels like we are back in that time again, but only it is worse. Then, we could see our enemy, but now the enemy is unknown and could be a loved one or close associate. Then, the international community and relatives overseas were sympathetic to our plight, and readily gave financial and moral support. Now, we feel like a pariah nation, closed from the outside world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crisci, who has worked with the WFP for 25 years, has also seen how the spread of Ebola is making it harder for people to feed their families. &quot;The average Sierra Leonean family spends anything from 60% to 70% of their income on food and, with this crisis, families in highly infected hotspots such as Kenema and Kailahun have lost one of the breadwinners in the family either to Ebola or to unemployment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some areas, he says, families are now spending 80%-90% of their income on food and adopting what the WFP calls &quot;severe food-coping strategies&quot;: as food becomes the predominant concern, people stop buying medicines, clothes and hygiene products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, with unemployment rising in towns and the countryside as people lose jobs in banks, hotels and restaurants, farmers stop tending their land and plantation employees shun work that involves large groups, and mothers and fathers are beginning to limit what they eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parents in some areas are now eating one meal a day to try to give two meals to their children,&quot; says Crisci. &quot;When both parents were working and had a steady income, they'd be having three meals a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the WFP is conducting a &quot;no-regrets operation&quot;, opting to bring in and then withdraw excess resources rather than risk failing those in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rations of rice, beans, salt, vegetable oil and supercereals for children - supplemented by onions, stock cubes, tea and toothpaste from the Sierra Leonean government - are being delivered to families whose houses have been locked down by the military and police in the hope of halting Ebola's spread.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments have pledged millions of dollars of aid, volunteer medics are signing up to work on the frontline and individuals are digging deep, but with the Ebola death toll relentlessly rising, the biggest donors are increasingly calling on other countries to step up their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there has so far been no &quot;naming and shaming&quot; of countries deemed to be dragging their feet, US president, Barack Obama, said on Tuesday that &quot;the world as a whole is not doing enough&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN has said it will cost just under $1bn (&pound;628m) to bring the Ebola outbreak under control over the next six months. Yesterday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it alone needed $260m for the fight, of which it had so far received nearly $125m, with a further $42m pledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO communications officer, Fadela Chaib, said the response from governments and donors was slow. &quot;We need 3.3m items of high-quality personal protective equipment and training provision of Ebola treatment centres,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many countries have provided health workers, including Cuba - with 165 workers sent to Sierra Leone - China, Canada, Russia and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcus Manuel, a senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute, said initially some G7 countries had seen the Ebola crisis as mainly a problem for countries with historical links to the west African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an issue of burden-sharing within the G7. That partly reflects long-term historical links that the US has with Liberia and the UK with Sierra Leone . . . Now we are seeing that others are realising that this is a global emergency,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimates of aid needed are being outpaced by the spread of the disease, which has already killed around 4,500 people in west Africa. On Tuesday, Dr Bruce Aylward, the WHO's assistant director general, said the number of new cases was likely to be 5,000-10,000 a week by early December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Manuel, UK and US plans to build treatment centres in west Africa were unlikely to deliver new beds until mid-December, and probably only 3,000 beds in total. &quot;The issue is not just about money,&quot; Manuel said. &quot;The cases keep growing . . . original estimates quickly run out of time . . . Each person is infecting another two people. That's the challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and the UK have led the calls for other nations to step forward. US secretary of state, John Kerry, said last week that the US had contributed $113m to the UN response and he commended smaller countries for their contribution. &quot;But the fact is more countries can and must step up,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, has praised Cuba and Timor-Leste for &quot;punching far above their weight&quot; with their contributions to the global response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power told the general assembly last week: &quot;According to the UN's financial tracking service, only 24 countries have pledged $1m or more to the efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notable absentees include Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the Islamic Development Bank are organising a meeting on 5 November in Jeddah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel said another issue was that pledges did not always translate into hard cash. The head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, said on Saturday that he was worried some donors were repackaging aid money, funnelling it away from other areas. He said new money was needed, and said the international response was too little, too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals are also digging into their pockets. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr Priscilla Chan, are donating $25m to the CDC Foundation, a private non-profit organisation gathering donations for the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's richest man, the Nigerian Aliko Dangote, provided about $900,000 to help Nigeria contain the disease, according to the UN list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the world, people are also offering to use their medical skills to treat people. The global campaigning organisation Avaaz said on Wednesday that more than 360 doctors, nurses and medical workers were among about 2,000 people who answered its call for qualified volunteers to fight Ebola in west Africa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">417 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engineers of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) have disclosed plans to effect several reconstruction works in Bong County, Central Liberia. Major Joshua T. Gayflor, Commander of the First Engineering Company, made the disclosure on Tuesday, October 14, 2014, when he briefed the Honorable Minister of National Defense and his entourage at the Tubman Military Barracks in Gbarnga, Bong County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military engineers all over the world are tasked with the wartime role of mobility, counter mobility and survivability in support of all other arms of the armed forces. In peacetime, they are actively involved in increasing infrastructure and national development. Accordingly, since its activation in 2007, the First Engineering Company has continuously supported other arms of the AFL and the Government of Liberia in infrastructural development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his brief to National Defense Minister Brownie J. Samukai, Jr., Major Gayflor revealed that engineers of the AFL are expected shortly to carry out the rehabilitation of a 1.8 kilometers stretch of road leading to the Gbarnga Ebola Treatment Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the AFL have been tasked to carry out immediate intervention in the reconditioning of the approximately three(3) kilometers by twelve (12) meter wide stretch of road that passes through central Gbarnga, particularly commencing from the intersection of the Gbarnga Administrative Building, northward towards Ganta City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL Engineers have further completed architectural plans and material estimate for the reconstruction of Camp VI, formerly occupied by units of the Bangladeshi Peacekeepers serving in Gbarnga. The Camp VI rehabilitation, when completed will cater for troops accommodation, office and recreational building as well as an equipment and motor bay for the recently acquired equipment and plants from the People's Republic of China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that the Engineering Company of the AFL has been actively involved in civil related works to include the rehabilitation of several bridges in the Todee District, the construction of the EBK (Edward Binyah Kesselly) Clinic Extension and the boathouse construction in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the Company has being involved in numerous humanitarian assistance projects in conjunction with the embassy of the United States of America. Presently the AFL Engineers are playing lead role in partnership with their counterparts from the United States of America in constructing seventeen (17) Ebola Treatment Centers around Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">354 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montserrado County Representative Saah Joseph has disclosed that efforts are being made to get an air ambulance to help boost he country's health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmaker who presently runs an ambulance service free-of-charge in the city, said the air ambulance, in the form of helicopter is valued at US12m, but because of negotiation, this has significantly been reduced to one million United States Dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking yesterday on the early morning program of VOICE FM, Rep. Joseph noted that the ambulance would be of great help as it would reduce the number of time one has to travel to seek medical treatment in other counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he has made a passionate plea to Liberians in the diaspora to contribute at least five United States dollars, while those at home may contribute one United States Dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Joseph said he is happy that President Sirleaf has consented to this initiative and that those in the diaspora have committed themselves to this. &quot;This is a Liberian initiative, &quot;Rep. Joseph intimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major concern of somecallers on yesterday program was maintenance. Some said the idea is good, but that this is not a priority. Others said this could be capital-intensive to maintain, therefore, it was not feasible at this time. One suggested that if any funds would be collected towards this, it should go to health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To these, the honorable lawmaker shared the concern of the callers and said the government can tap on the expertise of Samaritan Purse which has similar project or some international partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Montserrado County Lawmaker, who has been praised by the public for his role in combating the Ebola virus, disclosed that contacts are also being made to have ambulance for each district in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his colleagues have consented to help with the shipment if they are available. &quot;It is expensive, but life is more important,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Joseph said, &quot;At this time of crisis, it is necessary that the country begin to concentrate on those things to bring about improvement, so that the country would be prepared, should Ebola leave to deal with any future eventualities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four survivors of the deadly Ebola virus have been explaining their ordeal while undergoing their respective treatments at Ebola Treatment Units (ETU) in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyndy Kobbah, a health worker who got infected at the C. H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Zayzay Mulbah, Ahmed Kamara and Korta Bonarwolo , a Physician Assistant who contracted the disease at the Redemption Hospital yesterday mounted the podium at the Ministry of Information and explained problems they encountered while receiving treatment at the ETUs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyndy Kobbah said she and other health workers contracted the disease from a man who was treated at the hospital. She said after experiencing the Ebola virus symptom, she excluded herself from her children and moved to the ELWA ETU where the situation was not favorable when it comes to treatment, food supply and care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyndy Kobbah who is one of the patients who was treated with the Zmapp drug while unconscious said she could hear Dr. Brown saying that although she was unconscious, she needed to live thus the drug was administered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Kobbah who claimed to have been mistakenly sprayed while in the ETU said she was seriously sick and felt the smell of the spray, something which made her to start fighting for life not knowing that she was sprayed mistakenly instead of a dead body that was lying next to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told the Ebola News Conference that the condition at the ETU was pathetic because proper care was not given. &quot;They timely served us breakfast, lunch and dinner,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining her ordeal with the administration of the Zmapp drug, Madam Kobbah said the drug is injectable but she did not recognize it when it was first administered because she was unconscious. However she said during the second time it was given her, she observed that it is a liquid solution that can be put into the drip before its administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first time I took it, I came through from my unconsciousness and my entire body was normal and the second time started talking like a baby who is learning to talk. I thank God for bringing me through and secondly the health workers headed by Dr. Brown,&quot; she said in a sad tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lauded the children charity for giving her family a bag of rice after she was discharged from the ETU saying, &quot;The County I worked for has not given my children anything while they were quarantined and they have not visited me since I got home although they used to call me while in hospital. The health team only sprayed my house when I was discharged and in the process, they damaged all of my clothes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also complained that since leaving hospital she has not received any Physco-social counseling from anyone and her children that were quarantined and came down with malaria had to treat themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Ebola patients can survive provided they are given good care, food and attention from health Care Workers, family and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another survivor, Ahmed Kamara who got infected while trying to help a neighbor who was sick said he isolated himself from his family and moved into the ETU where his test was taken and later treated following hours of waiting at the ETU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivor Kamara also complained on the delay in feeding the patients at the ETU saying &quot;breakfast came at 12noon, launch at 3pm and dinner at 10 to 11pm daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamara called on the Government of Liberia (GOL) to give serious attention to the plight of the health Care Workers (HCW) because they are in the frontline in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zayzay Mulbah a survivor from the Medecine Sans Frontiers (MSF) Ebola Treatment Center at ELWA told the news conference that he is a survivor of Ebola and is working at the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Ebola Treatment Center ELWA 3, in Monrovia as a psychosocial support staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's been one and half months since I recovered from the Ebola virus disease. But how I contracted the virus is something that leaves me wondering for the rest of my life. I don't know whether I contracted it from a relative, or a close friend or by touching something that had been contaminated by an infected person. I was completely heartbroken when my test result at the MSF's ELWA-3 Ebola Treatment Unit was confirmed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was positive for Ebola. I did not believe it. I cried profusely. This was a turning moment in my life. I didnot believe from the onset that Ebola was real. I doubted its existence. But here I was, sitting in an isolation center confirmed for Ebola,&quot; he narrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said before getting sick, his friends and him would hang out at entertainment centers around their community, drinking stout and joking that it was Ebola medicine. He said it was not too long when he started feeling sick. &quot;It was after the fast and prayer that I started feeling symptoms of malaria and also started vomiting followed by diarrhea,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My mother thought that I was poisoned. Even still, my family was taking all the necessary precautions even though we were not sure I had Ebola. Whenever I vomited, my wife disinfected my vomit before cleaning it away. My wife and my daughter stopped sleeping by me in the same bedroom. To date, I am the only person who got infected in my family, because of these precautions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his condition was getting worse by the day and on August 23, he decided to go to the treatment center at ELWA Three. &quot;I went to the center and they did my test and confirmed me positive for Ebola. I was treated and after nine days, I recovered and I was discharged to go home,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I got back home, members of my community in CaIdwell came to welcome me. The elders of my community were happy about my recovery.Ebola can be deadly when people don't exercise care. People affected by the disease have a chance of survival if and when they seek early treatment,&quot; Zayzay Mulbah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He encouraged people who are sick with Ebola in Liberia not to waste time to seek treatment, saying, &quot;I share my story with you today to inspire you that having Ebola is not a death sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulbah extended his profound thanks to the staff of MSF for saving his life noting that they have given new meaning to his life. &quot;Now I've dedicated my life to the fight against the deadly epidemic. I am happy to be back working at the Ebola Treatment Unit to care for patients who are battling with the virus,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Physician Assistant Krolia Bonarwolo who contracted the disease after treating a nurse at the Redemption Hospital narrated the suffering underwent when he was diagnosed with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However he noted that since the intervention of MSF, World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners' treatment and care have improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the issue of survivors after leaving hospital must be followed by physco-social counseling, food to eat and empower to combat Ebola because when one goes to the ETU everything they have can be destroyed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">847 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States Ambassador to Liberia, Deborah R. Malac is calling on the Government of Liberia to pay health workers' salary to enable them concentrate on saving lives. Ambassador Malac made the statement yesterday when she toured the newly constructed Ebola Treatment Unit built by the U.S. Military along with the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) in Tubmanburg, Bomi County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She indicated that the United States Government has given the Government of Liberia additional US$5 million to pay health workers and stressed that it is the second time that the U.S Government has given the Government of Liberia US$5 million making it a total of US$10 million to pay health workers their salaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Malac stated that the money is for health workers who are in the system and hopes that the issue will be solved expeditiously, because the crisis will undoubtedly affect everyone in Liberia. She told journalists that this is not the time for politics, but a time for all Liberians to conglomerate and fight the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. diplomat is calling on the international community to step in and help Liberia eradicate the deadly virus. She mentioned that it is time that other countries come in to help because this is a global fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Glee Dada of the Armed Forces of Liberia who headed the team to the constructed Ebola Treatment Unit in Tubmanburg , Bomi County said the ETU is divided into three parts. The suspected, probable and confirm; and that there will be one hundred beds at the ETU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ETU is one of the seven ETU's that will be constructed by the U.S. Military in the fight against the Ebola virus in Liberia. The U.S. Military is working along with the AFL to construct these ETUs to enable those who are infected by the deadly virus get treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that over the weekend when the INQUIRER visited the Island Clinic in Tweh Farm, several nurses and Doctors were seen freely perambulating the vicinity of the hospital in protest to what they claimed the Ministry of Health's continuous failure to listen to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Justine Dewarlie, a Hygienic working at the Clinic, the Government of Liberia has paid lip service to their pleas. She said, since they were transferred to the Island Clinic from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, there have been serious problems between them and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justine Dewarlie cited salary reduction as the major hindrance to their work. &quot;We have earlier agreed through a communiqu&eacute; between us and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to be paid at least US$500 but contrary to the communiqu&eacute;, the Ministry only paid us for two weeks in August, an amount of US$250,&quot; Justine stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinic which has more than one-hundred patients admitted on Friday, was a scene of chaos when the Ministry of Health sent a new Administrator to take over from the Ugandan Doctor, Dr. AtatOmoruto who is currently assigned at the Island Clinic but met up with serious resistance from workers, prompting the intervention of Montserrado County District 6 Representative, Edwin M. Snowe who went and calmed the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile when contacted yesterday, Assistant Health Minister, Tolbert Nyenswah denied the closure of the JFK ETU, but said through a mutual agreement between the two parties, the health workers have agreed to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said, previously, the Ministry of Health and Health Workers earlier agreed upon Doctors receiving an amount of US$1,500, while nurses should receive US$750 when there were only two ETU's at the time, the ELWA-2 and Lofa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, after other facilities ETUs were created and the Ministry decided to renegotiate the agreement, something which created serious problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said efforts are on the way to better strengthen the agreement to avoid future embarrassment or recurrence of the September incidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Coleman who is Chairman on Senate Committee intimated that the situation currently was not healthy for the already fragile health system in the country. &quot;I would like to appeal to the National Health Workers Association of Liberia to kindly reconsider their decision to go on a go-slow action, any 'go-slow' action will seriously hamper the concerted effort of the Government of Liberia and the international community to contain and stop the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Liberia, the sub region and the rest of the world; it will also impede our effort at restoring essential health services in our country,&quot; Senator Coleman stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He intimated that efforts need to be exerted to find an amicable solution to the health crisis. &quot;We also want to appeal to the Executive Branch of Government and to President Ellen-Johnson-Sirleaf for consideration of the appeal made by the health workers of this country who are the front liners in the fight against the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) to have the president and the Secretary General of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia who were dismissed by the Ministry of Health, be re-instated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young women and girls in Liberia have been coping with many challenges ranging from social marginalization to sexual and gender-based violence. The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has worsened these challenges, placing women and young girls into a more disadvantageous position in Liberia and the entire sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our recent history, the deadly Ebola virus has now become Liberia's number one enemy, thus putting young women and girls at very high risk of early death, loss of income, loss of family ties, loss of social mobility, delay in formal education and professional development. In Liberia, women and girls carry the responsibility of catering for the family by providing basic home services such as preparing meals and attending to sick relatives. These responsibilities make women more vulnerable to the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in the process of rendering services to sick relatives, women are most likely to contract the virus because they do not have the necessary Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to safeguard themselves against the virus. What is worse is that many women lack basic first aid skills and knowledge to handle such deadly virus disease as Ebola. High illiteracy rate is largely a contributing factor to this precarious situation of women amidst the Ebola pandemic in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the challenges women face amidst this Ebola scourge in Liberia and West Africa, young women have experienced many challenges. Inaccessibility to quality education, unemployment and marginalization are but few of the challenges young women have experienced. These challenges have stalled the progress of women and have mostly kept them from the mainstream of national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economically, Liberian women who mostly rely on informal business as a means of sustaining their families are unable to continue their daily activities because of the Ebola-scare. In the market places, women are experiencing drastic reduction in sales and hence a decrease in their already meager incomes. This situation is posing economic hardship on women, as they are currently finding it extremely difficult to meet their daily survival needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola menace also poses serious challenges to young women, most of whom are single mothers in the country. Living as a single mother in Liberia, one has to either work or engage in informal trade in order to sustain her family. With the present Ebola crisis which has put most of the country's economic activities at a standstill, many women are now staying home to take care of their children, a situation that makes life more difficult for single mothers. Whichever way one looks at it, the prospect is grim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak in Liberia also has great academic effects on women and girls. Due to the high rate of Ebola-related deaths across the country, all academic activities are currently at standstill, thereby exposing young women to lots of educational setbacks and disadvantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Liberia tries to recover from years of civil unrest which left young women and girls as the worst affected, most women and girls have been trying to recover from educational paralysis by competing with their male counterparts. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the Ebola virus has posed a great setback to the educational sojourn of women and girls in the country. Compared to their male counterparts, women and girls were not given equal opportunity to seek education in the years back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the Ebola virus in Liberia, women have also been greatly affected by the closure of major health centers in the country. As it is a fact that women are mainly faced with many health complications, they often need to seek medical care in order to keep healthy. Amongst the vulnerable women, pregnant women have been badly affected by this situation. Many pregnant women have lost their lives not to the Ebola virus but to the resultant conditions created by the outbreak. Health workers in the country are afraid to accept patients including pregnant women who are at the point of bringing forth their unborn babies. It is reported that health workers are rejecting sick people in order to keep safe from contracting the virus, something which has caused the death of many young women in the country. Rejection of patients with other common illnesses, which could probably be cured, has led to the death of many young women as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the poor health care system in Liberia, the country subsequently became unstable as a result of the virus which has claimed over 1000 lives. The spread of the virus remains unabated, thus prompting assistance from all levels of the international community. The World Health Organization (WHO), the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) and other related infectious disease control agencies are extending a helping hand in a bid to bring the Ebola infection under control, but the risk of women being affected still remains high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, The Spread of the disease continues, a situation that has now become an international problem, sparking the concerns of regional, sub-regional, continental and global organizations. These organizations are now donating huge sums of money to fight the spread of the virus which most experts believe is unprecedented compared to other cases which erupted in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and during the early 1990s in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we welcome these donations and supports to the fight against Ebola in Liberia and the sub-region, what we believe is most needed to protect women and girls is a coordinated effort strictly targeting the spread of the virus among women and girls. Women and girls need special attention in order to protect themselves against the virus as well as to deal with the many challenges they face as a result of the virus outbreak in the country. If special attention is being paid to them the death caused by the virus among women and girls and other related issues will be contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many thanks to the Young Women Christian Association of Liberia (YWCA) for providing some Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) for its volunteers and for taking the lead in carrying out awareness on the prevention of the virus exclusively for women and girls. Since the outbreak of the virus in Liberia, the YWCA has played a major role in educating women and girls on the prevention of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, a little West African country recovering from nearly 14 years of devastating civil conflict is currently facing its worst times as the Ebola pestilence rages on. Liberia has been recorded the highest number of deaths amongst the three West African countries mostly affected by the Ebola epidemic in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus is not just a public health crisis. It has also become a social crisis, a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis, and a threat to national security well beyond the outbreak zones with women being the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">The Case of Government Being Adamant I Thought &quot;Never&quot; Belongs to God - in Re-Instating Health Workers' Leaders [column]</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">998 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the things I learned from my late grandmother was that I should always be careful during the time of conflict from using the word, &quot;NEVER,&quot; whenever there is a deadlock or disagreement in resolving a matter. In her words in simple English, the Old-ma told me, &quot;NEVER BELONGS TO GOD AND NOT MEN.&quot; She added that in a conflict situation, like in the present case of the government and the health workers, there must be a give-and-take situation,' and not adamancy. Since then many years ago, I have come to realize that the advice of my grandmother is indeed true because sometimes because of expediency, one has to give in resolving a matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To say, &quot;NEVER,&quot; to my late grandmother denotes a non-compromising stance, which could be a hurdle to resolving a particular conflict, which in addition, could stall all efforts to resolve whatever conflict or bone of contention in the conflict. Since then, I always try to avoid the use of NEVER whenever I am involved in a conflict situation, not necessarily concerning me as an individual.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, I reflect on what the old lady told me when I heard the Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Walter Gwenigale, insisting that he dismissed leaders of the Health Workers Association, would &quot;NEVER&quot;be reinstated. Interestingly, the minister made the assertion when he made a plea to striking health workers most of whom are working at the Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) to continue doing their work as all is being done to pay them the full amount of their hazard or risk allowances. The workers last week began the action in demand for their risk or hazard allowances which was promised them by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In making the plea on Monday at the Ministry of Information regular press briefing on the &quot;Fight against Ebola, Minister Gwenigale reminded the workers that the country's health system is at a cross-road and it is now incumbent upon all Health Care Workers (HCW) to contribute to the system, indicating that the system is seriously in need especially at a time when the deadly Ebola virus is raging on, and it requires the help of HCW to bring the situation under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the utter surprise of many, the Minister while making the plea to the striking workers, stating government's commitment to the workers, said the dismissed leaders of the health workers would &quot;NEVER&quot; be re-instated, and pointed out that if anyone is on strike because they want the dismissed leadership of the Health workers to be reinstated, they must have well stayed at home. In his words he said, &quot;Those dismissed health workers leadership will never be reinstated. They will not come back to work thus if anyone is striking to have them reinstated, the striking worker must just stay home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I ruminate on what the Minister said, many questions continue to crop up. The first is: why is the government recalcitrant, despite numerous appeals, including some from the Capitol Building? Why really did these leaders do to warrant such a stance against them by the government? What will the re-instatement of these workers cost the Liberian Government? Is there something the government is hiding from the public, as it is noted for poor communication? Is someone trying to settle score at the detriment of the Liberian people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been pondering over these questions because I see no reason at this time of national health crisis the government, being fully aware of the consequences of the Ebola outbreak, remains adamant in re-instating these workers. With this disease overwhelming the health sector of his country, it is unwise for this government to allow this issue to drag on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is said, &quot;not everything that is legal is expedient,&quot;' so this government should see reason to listen to the many pleas to have those leaders re-instated. As we usually say in Liberia, &quot;God will not come to talk to you (government).&quot; The country is faced with a serious war and threat, something for which the State of Emergency, therefore, this government should not be the cause for a diversion from this national crisis to that of the health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This country cannot be engaged in a war against this deadly disease and concomitantly at another front be entangled in another conflict with health workers. The government that is immensely being assisted by the international community should stop adding insult to injury. The recalcitrant stance of the government can be likened to declaring a war against one's enemies, and at the same time, decimating those who should be in the front to execute the war in its favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One again, the government should see reason to reinstate the dismissed health workers' leaders. Considering the prevailing situation at this time, it is ill-advised on the part of this government to allow this matter to drag on to the detriment of this war against Ebola. Specifically, I call on President Sirleaf, the head of the government to take note of this to avoid undermining all of the efforts to combat the spread of this pestilence that has befallen this nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I was watching the BBC News yesterday, I gathered that there is a decline in new cases of the disease in this country. This means we are making great efforts to curtail its spread. Hence, this issue of the health workers should not be a reason to undermine this, should the workers insist taking certain actions that would not positively contribute towards this fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To conclude, let me say it in the Liberian way, &quot;God will not come to talk to the government,&quot; therefore, let the government pay heed to the plethora of pleas by re-instating the health workers' leaders. I am delighted to hear that the Liberian Senate, which has been following the matter has also expressed concern over the Minister's statement that ,&quot;Those dismissed health workers leadership will never be reinstated. They will not come back to work thus if anyone is striking to have them reinstated, the striking workers must just stay home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A HINT TO THE WISE IS QUITE SUFFICIENT. I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to contain Ebola outbreak in West Africa have been associated with various forms of press freedom restrictions and attacks on journalists, which continue to hamper the provision of timely and accurate information to the public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a special report highlighting the impact of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) notes that the Ebola outbreak has had a significant effect on freedom of expression in West Africa, particularly in the worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report highlights incidents of Ebola-related freedom of expression violations; the challenges with respect to media freedom and professional reportage and the positive and negative contributions of the media--including social media and bloggers--towards efforts to prevent and contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the MFWA report, in light of the Ebola outbreak, journalists in Liberia have been attacked, harassed, censored and restricted under a state of emergency, which has included curfews and restrictions on general human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special Ebola-focused report also highlights challenges in Guinea, where three journalists were brutally killed by a mob during a mission to provide information on Ebola, and the situation in Sierra Leone, where officials have adopted measures that have the potential of instilling fear in journalists and deterring independent and impartial reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The limitations on the freedom of expression as it pertains to community sensitization about health issues constitute violations not only of the right to freedom of expression, but also of the right to health,&quot; said Anjali Manivannan, the MFWA's Programme Officer for Free Expression Rights Monitoring and Campaigns. &quot;Unfortunately, many restrictions violate the state obligation to respect these rights,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is further exacerbated by journalists and individuals who have used traditional and social media irresponsibly, thus increasing the spread of misinformation and even causing bodily harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The nature of the disease requires intensive and focused public education to contain it,&quot; said Sulemana Braimah, Executive Director of the MFWA. &quot;Thus, it is essential to train the media on how to provide timely and accurate information to the public, particularly in the most vulnerable and underserved rural communities in all countries in the region.&quot; The MFWA has been involved in meetings with the regional inter-governmental body Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS), the West African Health Organization (WAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation of the Red Cross to develop media and communication strategies for public education on the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Currently, the MFWA is rolling out a project to partner with rural and community radio stations across the West Africa region to intensify public education and awareness of the disease,&quot; Braimah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MFWA is a regional independent, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Accra. It was founded in 1997 to defend and promote the rights and freedom of the media and of expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">524 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid reports that health workers in the country have abandoned strike action, authorities of the Ministry of Finance &amp; Development Planning have disclosed that health workers assigned in Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) are currently being paid their hazard salaries for the month of September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MFDP said the latest development is consistent with its Press Release of October 8, 2014, which states specifically that health workers assigned in Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) will received their salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes as the Liberian government delegation attending the IMF and World Bank forms makes significant gain in attracting financial support and commitment from the world's financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press statement issued yesterday quotes officials as saying that of the 1,015 health workers deployed in ETUs, 619 health workers with bank accounts have received their pay in those accounts as of Monday, October 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Finance &amp; Development Planning Ministry explained that the 333 health workers without bank accounts are being paid over-the-counter at Ecobank, waterside branch after a careful verification of their identifications and authentication of their employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Ministry said it has observed that most of those health workers are not showing up to receive their payment. The Ministry noted that the payment at the bank is intended to ensure that during their payment process, they will be encouraged to open bank accounts into which subsequent payments would be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 1,015 workers submitted by Ministry of Health who are working in ETUs, 63 were in categories (carpenters, masons, etc), not originally captured but efforts are being made to have their issue appropriately addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the issue of differential between pre-crisis hazard pay and the newly agreed hazard pay, the Finance &amp; Development Planning Ministry said, government has decided to pay the differential for the month of September, with the amount of US$225,000 already disbursed to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. According to them, with this disbursement, the new agreed rates will take effect October 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government of Liberia wants to state categorically that it appreciates and values the heroic efforts of our health workers especially at this crucial time in our national existence. The government further wishes to assure them that everything will be done to ensure that working conditions are safe and conducive,&quot; the statement quoted officials of the MFDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It must be emphasized that the work our health workers are doing remain priceless and invaluable and no amount of money can compensate for their sacrifice,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the MFDP has completed all modalities and is awaiting the verified listing of deceased health workers along with the next of kin to begin paying death benefits. Once the list is received, payment will begin immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding the government's expressed commitment to providing an environment where voices are heard and duly considered, it will not condone misrepresentations, misinformation and threats, especially during this time of emergency&quot;, the statement concluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman identified as Henrietta Cerley says even though she believes that the Ebola virus exists but the mysterious death of five members of her family was a result of poison and not Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I lost my mother, my brother, sister, sister-in-law and my grandson... .it wasn't Ebola, it was poison but everybody considered it to be Ebola... &quot; Henrietta alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five persons reportedly died in the same house with Henrietta and other family members in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henrietta said following their death, she was quarantined along with the other children in the home by authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare with no food and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said had it not been for the help of community members, they would have starved to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henrietta said since the death of her family members she and the surviving children are being stigmatized by relatives, friends and other community members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus spreads through contact with an infected person, body fluids or the dead body of an infected person or animal. The virus kills up to 90% of its victims and has killed over 2,000 people in Liberia since its outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An entire town in Margibi County was nearly wiped away when residents initially blamed the death of over 20 people to food poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Henrietta, many people in Liberia continue to blame the death of their family members to either witchcraft or poison. The home of Henrietta was amongst 68,000 houses in 173 communities in Monrovia, traced and quarantined through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supported Community Based Initiative (CBI) with the Ministry of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBI Consultant Dr. Mosoka Fallah said the initiative has afforded community members the opportunity to participate and own the quarantine processes in their neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNDP Country Director Dr. Kamil Kamaluddeen told community members to avoid discriminating against Ebola survivors and families of people suspected to have died of the virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst the ongoing debates regarding President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf's recent communication to the National Legislature seeking extra powers to combat the Ebola virus, the acting Chairman of the opposition Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) Nathaniel McGill said the President was right to have written that body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGill said the declaration of the State of Emergency that was endorsed by the Legislature early August gave the President blanket power to exercise during the period under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Legislature was not specific relative to the power that the President can use during the State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McGill said the President did the right thing to have written the Legislature on specific powers that she wants to use for which he commended her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that the President did not act arbitrarily during the State of Emergency considering the blanket power that was given her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said the House of Representatives was also right to have rejected the President's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he said, shows that democracy is working in the post-conflict nation. He said though CDC did not agree with the President's letter, however, she was right to write the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC acting Chairman spoke Wednesday when he appeared on Truth FM Breakfast Show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGill said the rejection of the President's communication by the House of Representatives has no effect on the State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC acting Chairman also said the public rejection of the President's communication is based on past experience where leaders arbitrarily subjected the people of Liberia to unbearable actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no time in the history of Liberia that a national crisis has stretched the economy of the country at the brink of collapse. Ebola has done it! The disease has killed some of the country's finest citizens, decimated the economy and left the government of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf soliciting help from international financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were able to demonstrate strategic interventions in helping to restore hope to the Liberian economic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian delegation attending the ongoing Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group in Washington, D.C. has made strong case for the country attracting huge financial commitments and donations from bilateral and multilateral institutions across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the level of the IMF, the delegation led by the Minister of Finance and Development Planning Amara Konneh landed US$48 million for Liberia under the Fund's Extended Credit Facility (ECF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a release from the Ministry of Finance &amp; Development Planning, the delegation sought and received commitment to additional funds, specifically work towards accessing Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) as a bridging option with disbursement around March/April of 2015 for a similar amount as ECF, i.e. 25% of the country's quota. But in light of the travel restrictions placed on staff of the Fund, officials are planning detailed discussions in the context of fiscal year 2015/16 budget, ideally around January or February 2015, possibly in Accra, Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gracefully, the RCF can also be drawn additional times up to maximum of 50% quota within the year. In the meantime, the joint team of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) and the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), through an official letter to the Fund has maintained commitment to policy actions under ECF to the extent possible but keeping some focus on maximizing the opportunities under the RCF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They proposed discussions on a new program to begin from mid next year. Meanwhile, Policy Actions for RCF is proposed around repaying CBL fairly quickly to replenish reserves. Few months ago, the CBL made available US$5 million to the government's Ebola Trust Fund to fight the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same, the audit surrounding the roads contracts across the country was discussed, but the government assured the Fund that the audit is ongoing with a push to get it completed soonest. In brief remarks at the meeting with the IMF officials, the Managing Director of the Fund Madam Christine Lagarde suggested more budget support is needed as short-term spending is crucial to keep the economy moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She acknowledged that running a budget deficit may be a good option. For her part, former Liberian Finance Minister and head of the IMF Africa desk, Dr. Antoinette Sayeh also encouraged the Liberian government to push for grants from partners and more budget support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation also had the opportunity to meet World Bank President Dr. Jim Yong Kim who demonstrated honesty in working Liberia to overcome the Ebola scourge. He encouraged the team not to accept lowered aspirations, but rather ensure that the country pulls all stops to get the required support to help cover its budget gaps and receive optimum support from bilateral and multilateral partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kim promised to champion the cause of the three countries worst hit by the Ebola epidemic. He admonished the donor community not to re-program funds committed to existing programs, but rather provide new funds to fight the epidemic. Prominent among the issues that arose from the meeting with the Bank's country team, the Bank's overall commitment of US$400 million made to the region through its crisis window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a dispatch from Washington DC, current breakdown would be: Phase I US$105 million including US$52 million for Liberia (grant already disbursed); Phase II will be US$185 million including US$70 million for Liberia; and then US$92 million of budget support. The Bank is currently proposing US$30 million to US$10 million grant and US$20 million credit for Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are pushing hard for an increase in the budget support to Liberia, using interventions from the United States State Department and our Executive Director's office at the Bank,&quot; said Finance Minister Amara Konneh. Minister Konneh pointed out that the World Bank's aim is that US$70 million will be able to wider areas of need during the second phase US$70 million will be able to cover wider areas of need including WASH, essential health, agriculture and social protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the road infrastructure projects mainly the Redlight to Gbarnga Road, the Bank's transport team told the Liberian delegation that it is working hard to prevent contractors invoking force majeure, but the team noted that the Government of Liberia's supervising consultant left the project first thereby creating a possibility of extra costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement for the consultant for the feasibility study of the Ganta to Tappita road is, however, on hold due to Ebola. The parties observed that there is a risk that if advertisement is done, they may not get quality companies bidding because of the Ebola outbreak. The Tappita to Fishtown road project, to be financed by the Chinese, has also been delayed because of the delay in the conduct of the feasibility study which is blamed on the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia has meanwhile signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) via China Exim, but they won't conclude terms or predicted cost until feasibility undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Minister Konneh, China Exim will require 15% up front counterpart financing. But the World Bank has advised the government to ensure engineering standards are maintained and asks that the government requires appropriate safeguards from the Chinese company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian delegation also met with Raj Shah of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), who assured that every support will be provided to help stop the transmission of Ebola in the country. During this meeting, the parties discussed and accepted that since only 30-40% of cases will be in ETUs, getting control will depend on community care centres (CCCs) strategy working. But the delegation cited the adequacy of health professionals to staff the CCCs and lack of appropriate logistics capacity to supply the CCCs as major challenges to getting the disease under control. The USAID Administrator was keen to mention, however, that the United States military will not be able to supply all of CCC locations, but could be opened to setting up regional hubs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson was regarded one of the fiercest political and human rights activists before her election in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because it is said &quot;he who comes with equitable must come with hand cleans&quot; there have been not only vociferous criticisms against her administration's policies, perhaps as prism to test her faithfulness to the political and human rights struggle but also keen observation to see how she would dispense power during her tenure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reactions have been mixed over how the President has conducted herself on issues of civil liberties and fundamental rights. Her declaration of a state of emergency to fight the deadly Ebola, which some said should have actually been fought even under a national health emergency, coupled with her recent request or notice to the National Legislature to exercise the crudest of political powers, has left so much to desire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile too many people who thought the President's zest of arbitrariness is unmatched in Liberian history are angered. But Government of Liberia spokesperson says those who think so grossly misread the President and have got her intentions totally wrong, as The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Information Minister for Public Affairs, Isaac Jackson, has said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's letter to the National Legislature was not a desire to make her a dictator, as it is being misconstrued by some politicians in some quarters. .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The health crisis demands that government takes stringent measures to respond adequately to the threat posed by the Ebola disease. The president's letter is intended to promote collective leadership so it is saddening for people to miscalculate the intent of what the letter is portraying,&quot; Minister Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the statement at the Ministry of Information daily Ebola press briefing held in the conference hall of the ministry Monday. Recently, the president wrote the National Legislature seeking permission for the guarantee of emergency powers in accordance with constitutional provision to adequately respond to the country's health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's request has sparked a spate of debate and accusations among politicians and members of the Liberian public with contrary views that the president wants to be a &quot;dictator&quot;. Minister Jackson said these views which are being propounded by a &quot;negligible number of citizens,&quot; are &quot;baseless&quot; and lack any merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president has served for almost nine years and she has shown absolutely no sign of wanting to be a dictator, she has upheld civil liberties, tolerance and free speech. It is shameful and unfair on the part of those who think the other way about this government,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the president's letter is based upon constitutional provisions and that it promotes governmental coordination among the three branches of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Jackson has called on Liberians to refrain from negative arguments that have the propensity to undermine the government's ability, noting that Liberians should focus on directing efforts towards supporting government's quest to lift the country from the ongoing health crisis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA screening plans were in chaos yesterday, as it emerged travellers might be allowed to stroll into Britain without mandatory checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of political uncertainty and a major U-turn, officials finally started an ebola monitoring programme at Heathrow yesterday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron ordered late last week that checks be made on travellers from the stricken West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - after his ministers had dismissed the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the first passengers to arrive from the region were not tested until they volunteered for screening. Others were said to have walked through unquestioned, as officials revealed they might not be able to force travellers to co-operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first arrivals from Liberia to Heathrow's Terminal 1 said he was given a questionnaire and temperature check only when he volunteered to be screened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documentary maker Sorious Samura, 50, who had been in direct contact with ebola patients and health workers in Liberia, said he was shocked at the relaxed attitude of staff. I was told it is up to you if you want to be screened or not,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was disappointing. I think in a situation like this, given the fear that is being spread, I would expect a mandatory screening.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Samura, who had flown from the Liberian capital Monrovia to Brussels, before going on to Heathrow, had spent ten days making a film about the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the people who had been on our flight from Liberia to Brussels didn't go into the screening room, they just seemed to go through to customs and presumably out of the airport,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive Patterson, 32, who was working on the film with Mr Samura, also volunteered to be checked. He said: If you are going to make the effort and take this measure, you might as well make it compulsory.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist Gina Jere, 50, said she saw no one being screened at Heathrow after she arrived from Gambia via Brussels. Although Gambia has not been affected by the ebola outbreak, she said she was not even asked where she had flown from, adding: I think I should have been screened. This is real.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Downing Street spokesman last night insisted checks were mandatory, adding: We are taking a robust and proportionate approach based on the very latest medical advice.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan O'Mahoney, chief of staff at the Border Force, said travellers with clear symptoms of ebola could legally be detained. But he admitted healthy-looking passengers might not be forced to undergo checks. The screening involves a questionnaire to establish whether someone has symptoms or may have been in contact with ebola, as well as a temperature check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the virus can only be passed through bodily contact or fluids such as blood and sweat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But scientist Lord Robert Winston yesterday warned it could become airborne. In a House of Lords debate, he said experts must look at the risk of mutation of this virus, so that we can make certain its mode of transmission does not change'.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PESSIMISM about the health of the global economy has reached its worst level for two years, according to a closely followed monthly survey of investors around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proportion of portfolio managers who said they expected the economy to strengthen in the coming year has dropped to a net 32pc from 54pc in September, Bank of America Merrill Lynch found, after polling 220 investors managing $640bn in assets earlier this month. Concern about the US Federal Reserve bringing its quantitative easing programme to an end, expected this month, was the cause of the shift, with just 18pc of investors saying that monetary policy is too stimulative, the lowest reading since August 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook for Europe is darker still, BoA said. Just 16pc of investors expect to see the region's economy strengthen in the next 12 months, down from a net 45pc just a month ago. As a defensive measure, fund managers have bolstered their cash positions, with levels rising to 4.9pc from 4.6pc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the worries identified by BoA, as well as the plunge in the price of oil, have driven the aggressive stock market sell-off in recent weeks and ensured it was another volatile session for equities yesterday. Hit by a tumble in US markets overnight ahead of the London open, the FTSE 100 fell as much as 1pc in morning trade, not helped by yet more weak data from Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy. The session was rescued, however, by better than expected results from Citigroup that spurred hopes the US earnings season would reassure jittery investors. As a result, the FTSE 100 finished up 26.44 points, or 0.4pc, at 6,392.68, and Wall Street was trading higher by the time London had closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, led Britain's benchmark index higher and rose 15&frac12;p, or 4.8pc, to 339.6p - the first time it had closed in positive territory since last Monday - after HSBC reassured clients that worries about the spread of Ebola were overdone. &quot;We recognise that the Ebola epidemic is very serious in West Africa but we think it is unlikely to substantially impact air travel demand across IAG's network,&quot; analysts at the broker said. They upgraded IAG to &quot;overweight&quot; to account for the uplift the carrier will receive from falling fuel costs as the crude price slumps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil shares, however, were inevitably pulled lower by the further weakness in crude, with Brent sliding below $87 a barrel. Tullow Oil lost 11p to 518&frac12;p and BP was down 5.3p at 426.65p. Gas group BG declined 15p to &pound;10.25, despite &quot;buy&quot; advice from heavyweight broker Citigroup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staying with the resources sector, mining shares remained strong, continuing to benefit from Monday's better-than-expected trade data from China, the world's most voracious consumer of metals. Anglo American gained 35p to &pound;14.23 and Rio Tinto added 73&frac12;p to &pound;31.63&frac12;. Elsewhere among the risers, AO World, unlike BG, did respond to a broker upgrade and finished up 12.3p to 166.3p, an 8pc jump. Shore Capital analyst Mike Stewart, who had been a bear of the online white goods retailer, decided that the shares had fallen far enough since the group was floated at 285p in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The discrepancy between price and intrinsic value has not only narrowed but indeed disappeared,&quot; he advised clients, and lifted his recommendation to &quot;hold&quot;. AO drew attention when its float valued it at a huge 72 times forecast underlying profits for 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rolls-Royce, too, was boosted by positive analyst comment and closed up 20&frac12;p at 957&frac12;p after Investec's Rami Myerson said investors should continue to buy into the engine-maker despite recent weakness in the share price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microchip designer Arm Holdings, 31p better at 853p, rebounded following two days of heavy falls. American peer Microchip Technology unnerved investors in the sector when it warned on Friday that it had experienced waning demand from China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IQE, a maker of so-called &quot;semiconductor wafers&quot; used in wireless electronics, was lifted 2&frac14;p to 14&frac34;p, an 18pc surge, by director share purchases, which are usually taken as a sign of confidence. The chief executive, finance chief and chief operating officer have between them bought 3.3m shares at 12&frac34;p apiece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa-focused explorer Afren advanced 3.45p to 100.9p, after an independent review into unauthorised payments appeared to bring the episode to a close by resulting in a swathe of management dismissals. Still, RBC Capital Markets analysts cautioned that they expected &quot;some reaction from the Nigerian authorities&quot; over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also noted by the market that rival Nigerian explorer South Atlantic Petroleum (SAPetro) had lifted its Afren stake to 5.31pc. SAPetro is viewed by some as a potential suitor for Afren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earnings updates were an important driver of stock specific moves. Burberry, the luxury goods retailer, slid 54p to &pound;14.25, having unsettled investors with a warning of a &quot;more difficult external environment&quot;. Burberry shares were also hit by another profit warning from rival Mulberry, which itself tumbled 75&frac12;p to 675p.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN'S military campaign to help defeat the Ebola outbreak will eclipse the shrinking operation in Afghanistan by next month to become the Armed Forces' biggest overseas deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, said the UK had to act to help stop the spread of the disease, or it would tear through West Africa, then the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of November about 750 British troops will be in Sierra Leone helping to set up medical centres and train staff to tackle the outbreak, which has officially killed more than 4,000 people, and quite possibly four times that number.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said by then it would be the UK's &quot;biggest deployment overseas&quot; as it pulls back from its 13-year campaign in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;We can help save lives. We need to get the outbreak under control. Unless it's brought under control, it's going to spread across West Africa, into Europe and the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A military vessel due to sail on Friday to West Africa with a crew of 380, including Marines and medics, was on a &quot;vital mission&quot; at the &quot;front line of defending Britain&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RFA Argus, a 28,000-ton casualty and transport ship, will set off from Falmouth with 300 pallets of aid, 55 vehicles and three Navy Merlin helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ship will moor off Sierra Leone for as long as six months, giving logistical support for the British aid effort to build and equip hospitals treating victims of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Royal Marines will use landing boats to ferry aid and supplies around the country's coastline and rivers, while providing protection to the rest of the crew. The Merlin helicopters, usually used for hunting enemy submarines, will airlift supplies around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola patients will not be treated on the ship and its 100-bed sick bay will be reserved for British personnel who fall prone to other illnesses, or accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But commanders on board said they had had to reassure personnel and their families they were not at high risk of contracting the disease. Troops on board will be screened for possible exposure every time they go ashore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capt David Eagles said: &quot;Every Royal Marine going ashore will have a questionnaire to fill in when he gets back. &quot;Question one is, 'Have you been in contact with the local population', and if a 'yes' comes against that, straight away alarm bells are ringing and he will be monitored very, very closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He will come back on board, his temperature will be taken twice a day, the medics will be all over him and he will be well and truly monitored.&quot; If any symptoms of Ebola develop, he said &quot;the level of scrutiny would increase 10-fold&quot; and doctors would decide whether to transport the patient ashore to the British hospital in Kerry Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ship's crew will be relieved after two or three months, but will not be allowed shore leave during that time. Capt Eagles said he was confident he could keep them safe. He said: &quot;It's a very emotional topic and it is worrying for families, which is why we need to provide reassurance for our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One or two of the ship's company have said their families aren't very happy, but that was last week before the training, now I think it's much more balanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We try to reassure them the mission is safe, but it's not a sackable offence if they choose not to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army engineers and medics are already in Sierra Leone, with aid workers, building treatment centres. The first is expected to be ready for patients by the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, 120 members of the ship's company were given a 90-minute briefing on Ebola from three medical experts inside the crew's canteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Ruth Howlett-Shipley, the Navy's public health consultant, told the personnel: &quot;We are doing everything we can to make sure that you go out safely and come back safely. To contract Ebola you have to have direct contact with someone who is ill with Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surg Lt Dan Hawkins, 34, said: &quot;The thing I am most worried about as the ship's doctor, is malaria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We try to reassure them the mission is safe, but it is not a sackable offence if they choose not to go'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMMIGRATION officers at Heathrow shook hands with passengers from Africa on the first day of the emergency screening measures for Ebola, a traveller arriving back from Liberia claimed yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports suggested that the screening was being carried out on a &quot;haphazard and voluntary basis&quot; in apparent contradiction of health advice about contact with potential carriers of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Travellers on connecting flights from West Africa - where the disease has killed more than 4,000 people in Liberia and Sierra Leone - said they had not been obliged to undergo checks. They claimed they were given the option of being screened for symptoms of the virus or allowed to pass through the airport unchecked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sorius Samura, 51, a documentary maker who had spent 10 days in Liberia making a film on the crisis, said the British authorities did not appear to be taking the situation seriously enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;I've just come back via Brussels and our flight was met by an airport official saying we might be screened. He even shook our hands. That's something nobody does now in Liberia and infected countries; you have to learn not to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Samura said that when passengers on his flight eventually reached the immigration desks, they were given the option of filling in a questionnaire and undergoing screening, or simply passing through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;Most of the people who had been on our flight from Liberia to Brussels didn't go into the screening room, they just seemed to go through to customs and presumably out of the airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Samura opted to be screened and, along with several other passengers, filled out a questionnaire asking if they had any flu-like symptoms or a fever. Those who said they did had their temperature taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I only went through the screening because I felt a sense of responsibility, having seen the effect of Ebola where I've been,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clive Patterson, 32, who had been working with Mr Samura in Liberia, underwent further screening in a side room, but only because he volunteered the fact that he had been within 6ft of Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet even in his case, the measures appeared far from strict. He said: &quot;I was questioned a bit more than the others about my potential contact after I told them I had been working close to patients and corpses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was told I would be monitored more over the coming days. But the thermometer I was supposed to use to do that hadn't arrived yet, so they sent me off without it and just gave me the number of a local health team to stay in touch with. It seemed a bit haphazard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Samura and Mr Patterson said checks were far stricter when they left Liberia and they had been expecting a similar standard of screening on arrival in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They're very on the ball there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You wash your hands all the time before you go into or exit a building and the staff at the airport are wearing masks. We should be taking this a lot more seriously than we are doing in Britain. To be honest it was a complete joke at Heathrow,&quot; said Mr Samura. Mr Patterson added: &quot;I got the sense the airport officials were really only finding their feet and the only person who seemed to know what he was doing was the medical officer who questioned me further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Screening was introduced at Heathrow yesterday and will be extended to Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras in central London later in the week. The checks are expected to cost &pound;9million over six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The screening at Heathrow is being carried out by staff from Public Health England, though the initial point of contact for passengers is immigration staff. Some staff were understood to be unhappy that they were being placed in contact with potential Ebola carriers without having had specialist training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to reports that immigration officials had been shaking hands with passengers, a spokesman for Public Health England claimed that World Health Organisation advice stated that the disease could not be caught through such basic contact unless someone was showing advanced symptoms. He said: &quot;If you have passed the exit screening at the country of departure and you are well enough to be getting on the plane and walking off the other end you are not symptomatic and would not pass the disease on by shaking hands with someone. There has to be intimate contact with bodily fluids for the virus to be transmitted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Cameron acknowledged yesterday that the screening was not perfect but he believed that putting in extra checks was worthwhile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are doing this on the basis of sound medical advice,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Paul Cosford, the director of Public Health England, added: &quot;We will be learning from the experience over coming days. The principal benefit is about distributing information to people about the symptoms to look out for and who to contact in the event that they do get symptoms when they are in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked if screening was mandatory for those arriving from infected countries, he replied: &quot;We expect people to come through and we cannot see why they wouldn't [be screened]. It depends what you mean by mandatory. My understanding is that they have to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dan O'Mahoney, the chief of staff at Border Force, said there was no &quot;script&quot; for dealing with passengers who did not want to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, officials admitted they had no immediate plans to screen illegal migrants for the Ebola virus at Calais or Dover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August, Public Health England issued guidance for Immigration Removal Centres stating: &quot;The incubation period of Ebola ranges from two to 21 days, and so whilst unlikely, it is not impossible that a person infected in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone could arrive in the UK before developing symptoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola outbreak could grow to 10,000 new cases a week within two months, the World Health Organisation warned yesterday as the death toll from the virus reached 4,447 people, nearly all of them in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Bruce Aylward, the WHO assistant director-general, told a news conference in Geneva that the number of new cases was likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000 a week by early December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO's regular updates show that deaths have resulted from 4,447 of the 8,914 reported cases, but Aylward said that any assumption that the death rate was 50% would be wrong. He put the death rate at 70% because many deaths are not reported or recorded officially.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where detailed investigations have been carried out, it was clear that only 30% of people were surviving, he said, adding that the figure was almost exactly the same in the three hardest hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. &quot;This is a high-mortality disease in any circumstances but particularly in these places,&quot; said Aylward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grim forecast came as the first returning passengers from west Africa to Heathrow airport were asked to undergo temperature checks and questionnaires about their contacts with Ebola patients. The &pound;9m screening exercise has been criticised by some experts, who say it will not pick up those who have the virus but are not yet symptomatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, it emerged that a nurse who contracted Ebola has been given a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who has recovered from the disease. The nurse, Nina Pham, was infected while caring for Thomas Duncan, who was taken ill on a visit from Liberia and died in Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brantly has donated blood for three Ebola patients, including Pham. &quot;He's a doctor. That's what he's there to do. That's his heart,&quot; said Jeremy Blume, a spokesman for the non-profit medical mission group Samaritan's Purse, which Brantly was working for in Liberia. The WHO said plasma from people who had overcome Ebola, which contains antibodies against the virus, should be tried as a treatment, but it is hard to use outside the sophisticated healthcare settings of the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US president Barack Obama said last night that the &quot;world is not doing enough&quot; to combat the disease, and that &quot;everybody's going to have to do more than they are doing right now&quot;. Obama said he wants to make sure lessons learned from Pham's case are applied to health centres around the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, newly set up to coordinate the fight against the disease, has set targets to isolate 70% of suspected cases in west Africa and safely bury 70% of the dead within the next 60 days - described as the 70-70-60 plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tough target, said Aylward, but if it takes 90 days rather than 60, &quot;a lot more people will die who shouldn't and we will need that much more capacity on the ground to manage the caseload&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the numbers continue to rise, the need for beds and health personnel to treat the sick will increase - and there is a serious shortage of trained and experienced people to lead the effort, according to Aylward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good training programmes are being put in place, particularly by the UK and the US, &quot;but there is still the challenge of getting internationals on the ground who have expertise - in Ebola ideally&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past four weeks, about 1,000 new infections a week - including suspected, confirmed and probable cases - have come to light. Aylward said the WHO was concerned about the continued spread, especially in the capital cities of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - Freetown, Conakry and Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The virus is still moving geographically and escalating in the capitals,&quot; he said. Large treatment centres are taking a long time to build and staff and those that exist are full. A new strategy, which the UK is supporting in Sierra Leone, is to set up a lot of community care units with a handful of beds, where people can stay and get basic care rather than endangering their families at home, while waiting for a treatment centre bed. The units will also help people arriving with fever because they have malaria. At the moment, they are not being treated or are afraid to go to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Berlin, a UN medical worker infected with Ebola in Liberia has died despite &quot;intensive medical procedures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St Georg hospital in Leipzig said yesterday that the 56-year-old man, whose name has not been released, died overnight. The man tested positive on 6 October, prompting Liberia's UN peacekeeping mission to place 41 other staff members under close medical observation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A team of 750 military personnel setting off from Cornwall to help tackle Ebola in Sierra Leone in the Royal Navy hospital ship Argus will be banned from shore leave during its three-month deployment and medical staff will take their temperature twice a day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers travelling to the UK from west Africa say they were not given automatic medical checks for Ebola, forcing Downing Street to defend its screening regime on the first day of operation at Heathrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour urged Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, to get a grip on the situation after there was confusion among travellers and officials about whether it was voluntary for people entering the UK from the worst affected regions to undergo temperature tests and medical checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Hunt told MPs that border officials would have to rely to some extent on people noticing posters in airports and presenting themselves to the authorities if they thought they were at risk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeared to be the case at Heathrow's Terminal 1, where some travellers expressed bemusement and even shock at the relatively low-key nature of the measures, which will cost about &pound;9m over the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sierra Leonean journalist who travelled via Brussels from Monrovia, Liberia, said passport control staff only realised where he had come from when he volunteered the information. Sorious Samura said: &quot;I could have just come through without any screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our flight was met by an airport official saying we might be screened. He even shook our hands. That's something nobody does now in Liberia and infected countries - you have to learn not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the people who had been on our flight from Liberia to Brussels didn't go into the screening room, they just seemed to go through to customs and presumably out of the airport. I only filled in the questionnaire and went through the screening because I felt a sense of responsibility, having seen the effect of Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among others arriving at Heathrow was ReGina Jane Jere, who travels frequently between Africa and her home in London. She said she had noticed little discernible difference during her arrival - apart from the presence of a sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't stopped. I wasn't asked any questions. I wasn't asked where I had come from,&quot; said Jere, who had travelled from the Gambia via Dakar and Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I travelled to (the capital of the Gambia) Banjul on Friday and as I walked into the airport terminal everyone was actually screened and somehow I felt really quite comfortable that I was screened and I was going into a country that was doing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health England said passengers on indirect flights from Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone - the three west African countries at the centre of the outbreak - would be automatically flagged at passport control. They would then be escorted to a screening area, where their temperature would be taken and they would fill out forms asking if they had had contact with any Ebola patients, experienced any symptoms of the disease or visited a traditional healer or hospital. Dr Paul Cosford, the medical director of Public Health England, said screening would not be compulsory, but he expected passengers would agree to it for the sake of their own health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they are not cooperative in coming for screening, it is an issue Border Force colleagues will look at,&quot; said Cosford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is public health legislation so we can take steps if we believe somebody is a risk to the public's health and that can lead to them being treated in hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, David Cameron's spokesman appeared to contradict the idea that screening was not compulsory. &quot;They are required to go through the screening process,&quot; he said. &quot;We are taking what I would describe as a robust and proportionate approach to this.&quot; Speaking on LBC 97.3 radio, Cameron later acknowledged that the screening would &quot;never be perfect&quot; and &quot;we won't catch everybody&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour said it was worrying that just 24 hours after Hunt's statement to the House of Commons there was confusion over the new screening programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that nobody in government seems to know whether the screening is voluntary or not will not build public confidence. The government urgently needs to clarify its policy on screening to reassure the public that it has a grip.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A naval ship with a 100-bed medical complex and loaded with helicopters, landing craft, tonnes of emergency supplies and almost 400 personnel is preparing to head for Sierra Leone to help tackle the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus, a vast hospital and support vessel, will sail from Falmouth in Cornwall to west Africa and act as a forward base for army medics, engineers, soldiers and aid experts who will build and operate medical centres, train local doctors and nurses and transport vital supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of next month 750 British troops will be operating in Sierra Leone. With troops continuing to withdraw from Afghanistan it will be the largest overseas deployment of UK forces anywhere in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to the 28,000-tonne RFA Argus the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, described the ship, which first saw action during the Falklands conflict, as a &quot;warhorse&quot; embarking on a vital humanitarian mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fallon said British efforts in west Africa would help save lives there but also stop Ebola spreading through other parts of the continent, Europe and the UK. &quot;She will be at the frontline defending Britain against the disease,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing more than any other country, certainly much more than in Europe. We're putting a huge effort into this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Fallon spoke on the flight deck of the 175-metre-long ship, military and civilian staff (85 of the 140-strong ship's crew are non-military) loaded supplies, weaponry and equipment - including protective suits - before its departure at high tide on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship's commanding officer, Captain David Eagles, a veteran of conflicts in the Middle East and the Balkans, accepted there was an &quot;unknown quantity&quot; to this mission. &quot;It is worrying to the crew and their families but I'm confident we can achieve what we've been tasked to do and bring all our people safely home to their families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argus has varied roles. First, it will transport personnel and hardware, including more than 50 vehicles along with tonnes of bottled water and ration packs. The voyage, which includes a stop-off in Gibraltar to pick up more gear, will take about a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When in theatre, it will act as a base for three Merlin helicopters, which will be used in surveillance work and to move equipment and people. Anti-submarine equipment is being stripped out of the aircraft to provide more space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argus will also become a giant landing stage for powerful boats operated by 80 Royal Marines, who will provide the security for the British operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the ship, which has the same sort of facilities as an NHS hospital, will provide medical cover to British personnel - military and civilian - who might suffer injury or illness in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 80 medical staff will be on board, including surgeons, consultants, radiographers, anaesthetists and nurses. Some will go on shore to help with the training; others will remain on Argus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the ship will not do is treat anyone who contracts Ebola. Every time a marine or medic goes on shore, they will be given a questionnaire about contacts with local people. If they have had contact, their temperature will be taken twice a day and if there are concerns that they have Ebola they will be evacuated to a British-run facility onshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is to keep the ship a safe, sterile environment from which the UK's efforts can be coordinated locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday 120 members of the ship's company gathered in the canteen to hear a 90-minute briefing on Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ruth Howlett-Shipley, the navy's public health consultant, said: &quot;We are doing everything we can to make sure that you go out safely and come back safely.&quot; Among the questions she faced was: &quot;If I sit next to a marine at breakfast, who shook hands with an infected person, will I contract Ebola?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surgeon Lieutenant Dan Hawkins, the medical officer for Argus, said: &quot;There's always concerns when you deploy and with the nature of where we're going to there are added concerns and considerations but the crew are very much looking forward to going.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions on board will vary. Some of the men will sleep in 27-person dormitories; others share smaller cabins. Some will leave the vessel on missions but those who have no operational reason to head for shore will stay on board for the whole of a two- or three-month tour. They have Sky Sports and a ration of two cans of beer a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will not be a short trip - Argus has been told to prepare for six months away. Eagles said the crew, medics and troops were used to working in trying conditions. &quot;It will be quite tough but I think people will understand. I think people are going to be quite busy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must confess: I was initially concerned that I am perhaps not sufficiently qualified to weigh in on our planet's current Ebola panic, seeing as I am neither a doctor nor a nurse nor a scientist of any kind nor an African fruit bat nor Dustin Hoffman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then I discovered that singer and odious woman-puncher Chris Brown had recently offered his opinion on the matter (he thinks &quot;this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control&quot;, which is technically true, I guess, though not in the intentional, cosmic way I suspect he means); and so has bleating conspiracy theorist Dinesh D'Souza, who called Obama's African roots a &quot;more dangerous infection&quot; than the virus itself; and so has psychiatrist and large animatronic thumb Keith Ablow, who alleged that President Obama &quot;may literally believe we should suffer along with less fortunate nations . . . allowing illegal immigrants and, potentially, even diseases to flow through&quot; - and I realised that I am more qualified to comment than at least three famous idiots who have already inflicted their opinions on millions and millions of people. After all, I read The Hot Zone when I was 14. I bet Chris Brown hasn't even seen Outbreak. And you call yourself an armchair epidemiologist, sir. The gall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And anyway, there is one area in which I am eminently, objectively pedigreed to comment - relative to famous idiots or not - and that is in my capacity as a human being living in a culture where panic is marketed as both disposable entertainment and a way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realistically, something will wipe us out eventually, though it probably won't be Ebola. We're hurtling toward a wall, even if we can't see what it's made of or when we'll hit. Again, I'm not a doctor (so please stop emailing me pictures of your weird toe), but I'm a fairly educated, competent adult and I hate the way we talk about this stuff - like it's simultaneously the end of the world and just another fun Dustin Hoffman germ-thriller. It's a dead end. You can't fix the apocalypse, and there's no reason to fix fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow, in America at least, we seem to be taking Ebola both too seriously and not seriously enough. Rightwing xenophobes rage about closing the borders and impeaching #OBOLA (heads up, white Americans: if anyone has a track record of deliberately introducing devastating diseases to the North American continent in order to wipe out the population, it's not half-Kenyan lawyers), while the rest of us titter proprietarily over the gory doom that we know will almost certainly never touch us; meanwhile, we've skimped on funding infectious disease research ever since the 90s Ebola scare lost its lurid lustre, and healthcare workers are paying the price. As Wired reported on Monday: &quot;If there were more infection-prevention research, the nurse in Dallas (and probably the one in Spain, who may have contaminated herself doffing her gear) might not have become infected.&quot; Not only that, but Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, says that, if it wasn't for funding cuts, we would probably have an Ebola vaccine by now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sooo . . . do we learn from that? Are we going to invest in medical equipment that protects doctors and nurses from contamination? Procedures that minimise human error? Education campaigns about the dangers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria? Or even, um, a functioning healthcare system? Anything constructive? Nah, said John McCain on Sunday. Instead, he suggested, Obama should appoint an Ebola tsar to assuage Americans' superficial, borderline recreational anxieties about a disease that mainly affects people in west Africa living in extreme poverty without access to clean water and modern medical facilities, along with the underfunded, understaffed medical personnel desperately battling the epidemic. Not to mention the fact that the Obama administration almost certainly has not just appointed officials but entire agencies to contain Ebola in the US (if I learned anything from Outbreak, Rene Russo is also on the case), and that McCain's party hates tsars, government oversight in general and probably Rene Russo, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps John McCain and his cohort ought to invest in a Get a Grip tsar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, if he's genuinely interested in prolonging and enhancing the lives of his constituents, he should advocate for an Influenza tsar, or a Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci tsar, or a Living Wage tsar, or a Forgive My Medical Bills/Student Loans tsar, or a Tell the Police to Stop Murdering Black People tsar. Any of those would be more useful, in the scheme of things. Not that Ebola doesn't deserve attention - it absolutely does, and fast (and my deepest condolences to every single person who's been affected) - but it deserves attention centred on west Africa, and not the kind of attention that deliberately whips the public into a panic so that their panic can be used as a political bargaining chip by elderly iguanas while the problems that cause and perpetuate the disease go unaddressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will retract my iguana comment when John McCain starts agitating for a Global Clean Water tsar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governments of Norway and the United States of America have pledged to stand by the Government and people of Liberia by providing more financial and material support in its fight against the Ebola virus disease ravaging the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Rajiv Shah said their respective Governments see the Ebola crisis not only as a Liberian problem, but a global crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They both renewed calls for more global support to its eradication. They spoke separately at a joint news conference in the foyer of the Foreign Ministry when they met with President Sirleaf on Tuesday, October 14, 014.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Foreign Minister Brende announced that the Norwegian Government has released US$60 million for West Africa since the outbreak started and an additional US$15 million through the World Health Organization (WHO) for countries affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further announced that 160 doctors from his country have already signed up to be deployed to West Africa including Liberia and at the same time announced that his country will provide military transportation in the form of logistical support to Liberia - all aimed at eradicating the epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Norwegian Foreign Minister furthered that his Government saw it as a responsibility to reach out to Liberia due to the long standing relationship between the two countries especially with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, at the helm - an award given by Norway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brande stressed that Liberia is close to the heart of Norway and they cannot sit idly by and see the country decimated by the Ebola virus disease; but instead join the fight to eradicate the disease that will lead to the resumption of the Norwegian Government's development aid to the country especially in the energy and forest sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, the USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah informed journalists that the United States has put in place significant measures, including finances in order to contain the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shah disclosed that the U.S. Government has approved and begun spending US$400 million with over 600 staff of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the country working with USAID to support the Liberian Government, making it the largest CDC operation outside of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USAID Administrator announced further that U.S. Government through USAID would give US$5million to support the Liberian Government in its compensation program for health care workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shah noted, however, that this amount is part of the US$142 million critical support, out of which US$65 million would be targeted toward training, community-base engagements and the construction of care centers across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USAID Administrator renewed the United States' commitment to helping Liberia in its fight against the Ebola virus disease and hoped that everyone will work together to return Liberia to normalcy in order to resume its development programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, President Sirleaf reiterated that the intervention by the two governments demonstrate the level of strong bilateral relationship which has helped Liberia get back on track since her ascendancy which is now being threatened by the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader said her Government is pleased with the partnership with these two countries and expressed optimism that these relationships would go a long way in rebuilding Liberia's health care sector that has been overly stretched by the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the Norwegian delegation that met President Sirleaf included: Chief of Staff Vebjorn Dysvik and Harald Tollan of the West Africa Unit of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry; while the USAID Administrator was accompanied by USAID Director of Mission John Winfield, DART Leader Bill Berger and U.S, Ambassador to Liberia Deborah Malac.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) constructed in Bong County has reported significant progress in dealing with affected Ebola patients, according to information gathered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer in Charge of Ebola Treatment Unit in the county, Medical Corps Program Coordinator Sambhavi Cheemalapati, explained to reporters over the weekend that the admittance of patients at the unit had reduced, and that very few suspected cases have been reported in recent time which has led to the availability of more treatment beds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, most of the patients admitted at the ETU have been treated and discharged with only 13 confirmed persons left for proper observation and recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asserted that amongst the three sections constructed for patients, some of the patients admitted at the ETU did not have the virus at all which meant that they were taken to a safer wall for observation, while those that were diagnosed with the virus were left for further treatment and sent home upon recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently, the ETU was overwhelmed with cases, but with the aid of the mobile lab which is speedily enhancing the process, we're getting the results,&quot; she said, adding that the center is now catering to patients from Margibi and Nimba counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the present progress, more cases have not been reported and the situation seems to be stable at the time, compare to few weeks earlier when the outbreak began,&quot; Madam Sambhavi Cheemalapati explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the reduction in the number of cases in the county is the result of the mobile lab brought in by the U.S Army which is providing testing results in the matter of hours compare to old methods that waited for blood samples to be taken back and forth which lasted for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Cheemalapati further informed The ANALYST that the ETU is running very well and that the community has been very receptive in allowing the center to be established, noting that more progress will be achieved if they continue to follow the same trend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">432 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management of the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company, (LPRC) says there is no plan for mass dismissal of employees and contractors sent on Ebola break, saying that the report is only meant to instill unnecessary fear in the minds of people and families at this critical period in the history of Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management was sharply reacting to a front page banner headline in the local daily captioned, &quot;At LPRC, GoL Ministries, Agencies: Mass Dismissal Looms? - Stay - Home Order Becomes A Trap&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper quoted a source as saying that the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company Management allegedly concluded to dismiss all employees and contractors sent home on furlough due to the Ebola outbreak for what has been termed loss of revenue for management&quot;, but failed to contact the LPRC for comment on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its reaction, the LPRC management in a release stated that the paper chose to breach the ethics of the noble journalism profession by quoting a source who erroneously gave out information that is not only &quot;false&quot;, but is &quot;misleading and has no iota of truth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The author of this story or his anonymous source&quot;, according to the release from LPRC, &quot;is heartless and inhumane and has engaged in such devilish scheme to instill unnecessary fear in the minds of people and families at such a critical period in our country's history where the entire country is united in fighting the deadly Ebola virus disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the LPRC release: &quot;We wish to categorically state here that at no time has there been a meeting at the LPRC to dismiss non-essential staffs who are currently at home decongesting the work place as part of measures in fighting Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In furtherance, the company intoned that it cares for all its employees, contractors and cadets as everyone continues to get his or her full salary at the end of every month irrespective of who is essential or non-essential. The LPRC will continue to cater to its employees, contractors and cadets and has no plan to relieve or dismiss anyone in the name of &quot;loss of revenue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LPRC urged the newspaper and other media outlets or organizations to be free and contact the institution for information relative to the entity order than fabricating stories with the aim of sensationalizing things to achieve some selfish motive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, we wish to inform the public that we remain committed to the fight against Ebola and urge everyone to be committed in the fight in eradicating it from our beloved country, Liberia. et us all work collectively in fighting this menace Ebola and together we can defeat it&quot; the release concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1057 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Armed Forces of Liberia has since melted away from the public glare, gone into the barracks, leaving pundits to wonder whether this has got to do with the widely condemned West Point shooting incident in which its soldiers are held culpable or because of the advent of armed American soldiers on the Liberian soil or because of both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the withdrawal of the AFL even while the state of emergency it was policing still rages does not affect the role of other security units of the Liberian state. The Liberia National Police (LNP) is seemingly filling the void with a multiplicity of activities prominently related to the fight against Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who is acting as the Minister of Justice following the resignation recently of former Minister Christian Tah has been accounting for the LNP stewardship when he was speaking at the formal opening of the October 2014 term of court. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the unexplained return of the Armed Forces of Liberia from various points of assignment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">across the country where it was leading efforts under the state of emergency declared by President Sirleaf in mid this year, the Liberia National Police has reportedly stepped in to carry out the arduous task of security amid the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disappearance of armed AFL soldiers coincided with the submission of special investigation report on the West Point shooting incident that left one person dead and two injured as well as the disembarkation of the first troop of American soldiers at the Roberts International Airport. The AFL withdrawal has increased the responsibility of state security on the Liberia National Police which, according to Acting Attorney General of the Liberia, Benedict Sannoh, &quot;has now assumed full security over the Ebola Crisis and the AFL has returned to the Barracks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the support from the Bureau of Immigration, Cllr Sannoh said, the &quot;LNP continues to escort patients, provide protection for Ebola Treatment Centers, and the Red Cross Team and assist in the lifting and removal of bodies from the various communities and ETC to crematories, as well as in the actual cremation of bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the formal opening of the October term of court at the Temple of Justice, Cllr Sannoh revealed that &quot;Over the past month, the frequency of riots, road blocks and civil disobedience including attacks against police officers in communities over Ebola related bodies have been reduced to zero.&quot; He lauded &quot;the rapid response of the Red Cross Teams backed by the LNP, and the concerted sensitization and foot outreach by personnel of the Police Community Relations Division of the LNP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To enable it discharge these functions effectively,&quot; the Acting Justice Minister said, &quot;LNP trains 100 officers each week on Ebola Preventive measures, and has taken steps to maintain law and order without arrests and custodial investigations except for very serious offences such as murder, armed robbery and rape.&quot; He noted that the Bureau of Immigration in addition to providing support to the LNP, has deployed additional manpower along our land borders with increased patrols In a bid to stop illegal entry and cross border spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Sannoh indicated that one of his principal deputies, the Solicitor General, in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders and counterparts, and the support of 18 newly trained City Solicitors has established a Pre-trial Detention Working Group for the purpose of addressing the issue of prolong pre-trial detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Approximately 581 pre-trial detainees have been released nationwide through the prison de-congestion program since August, 2014. All correction facilities continue to trace, screen and possibly quarantine inmates, officers and others as appropriate who are found to be symptomatic of the EVD Or who may have been in contact with the suspected inmates,&quot; the Acting Justice Minister reported the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Acting Justice Minister, progress against Ebola would not have been achieved without the moral, technical, logistical, and financial support directly and indirectly, from the international community. He named some to include United Nations, European Union, African Union, ECOWAS, World Bank, African Development Bank, etc. as well as individual countries such as the United States of America, China, Cuba, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He acknowledged that significant support also continues to flow from local partners including business entities and individuals. &quot;The Government and the people of Liberia remain grateful to these local and international partners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cllr. Benedict F. Sannoh further used the ceremony to bemoan the outbreak of Ebola in the country. &quot;No time would have been more suitable than now, and nowhere more appropriate than in the solemn Chambers of this Honourable Court for the Chief Justice, to speak about the Ebola crisis facing the nation, the threat it poses to the survival and security of the state, and to underscore the need for a collective effort to eradicate the virus from our country,&quot; he said, commending the Judiciary for the steps it has taken to contain the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalled that when the virus surfaced, the healthcare delivery system was faced with a combination of challenges including lack of Specialized Ebola treatment Centers, lack of beds, appropriate logistics including in particular drugs and medical supplies, and personnel protective equipment (PPE) for medical personnel. These challenges were exacerbated by entrenched cultural and traditional practices, lack of awareness on how to prevent the virus, and complicated by a message of doom that Ebola has no cure, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Acting Chief Justice of Liberia expressed satisfaction that a new Community Care Centre (CCC) system is being developed, to treat patients who are sick but not immediately apparent that the cause is Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The provision of psychosocial support to individuals, families and communities, affected by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and to front-line workers is on-going. Every ETU has at least one mental health professional and two social workers. In order to ensure that the Ebola messages get to every segment and sector of the Country, the on-going Ebola awareness campaign has received a boost with over 100 teachers trained to carryout Ebola messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson was regarded one of the fiercest political and human rights activists before her election in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And because it is said &quot;he who comes with equitable must come with hand cleans&quot; there have been not only vociferous criticisms against her administration's policies perhaps as prism to test her faithfulness to the political and human rights struggle but also keen observation to see how she would dispense power during her tenure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reactions have been mixed over how the President has conducted herself on issues of civil liberties and fundamental rights. Her declaration of a state of emergency to fight the deadly Ebola which some said should have actually been fought even under a national health emergency, coupled with her recent request or notice to the National Legislature to exercise the crudest of political powers, has left so much to desire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile too many people who thought the President's zest of arbitrariness is unmatched in Liberian history are angered. But Government of Liberia spokesperson says those who think so grossly misread the President and have got her intentions totally wrong, as The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Information Minister for Public Affairs, Isaac Jackson, has said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's letter to the National Legislature was not a desire to make her a dictator, as it is being misconstrued by some politicians in some quarters. .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The health crisis demands that government takes stringent measures to respond adequately to the threat posed by the Ebola disease. The president's letter is intended to promote collective leadership so it is saddening for people to miscalculate the intent of what the letter is portraying,&quot; Minister Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the statement at the Ministry of Information daily Ebola press briefing held in the conference hall of the ministry Monday. Recently, the president wrote the National Legislature seeking permission for the guarantee of emergency powers in accordance with constitutional provision to adequately respond to the country's health emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's request has sparked a spate of debate and accusations among politicians and members of the Liberian public with contrary views that the president wants to be a &quot;dictator&quot;. Minister Jackson said these views which are being propounded by a &quot;negligible number of citizens,&quot; are &quot;baseless&quot; and lack any merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president has served for almost nine years and she has shown absolutely no sign of wanting to be a dictator, she has upheld civil liberties, tolerance and free speech. It is shameful and unfair on the part of those who think the other way about this government,&quot; Jackson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the president's letter is based upon constitutional provisions and that it promotes governmental coordination among the three branches of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Jackson has called on Liberians to refrain from negative arguments that have the propensity to undermine the government's ability, noting that Liberians should focus on directing efforts towards supporting government's quest to lift the country from the ongoing health crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of public employees dubbed &quot;non-essential&quot; had been bracing themselves for dismissal as it was rumored in the last few days--in fact reported by some media outlets--that the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf administration would finish them up once and for call while they stay home playing check-up and other idle games with families and neighbors observing indefinite stay-from-work orders imposed by Government in the aftermath of the outbreak of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports raised temperatures not only amongst the government workers but within the larger public realm since thousands of former employees and families are still nursing traumas from the &quot;down-sizing&quot; and &quot;right-sizing&quot; policy of the administration which swept the public service amid lamentations and criticisms. But the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT) has calmed the palpitating nerves, stating the Government has got no such intention. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the dismissal of thousands of civil servants by the administration of the Sirleaf administration was spreading like wild fire in the Dry Season and the public, particularly the public employees, got submerged in timidity and fear. Liberia's unemployment rate is high and Government which is the largest source of employment for citizens has been slow in taking more people. These factors, coupled with the administration's somewhat notorious record earned when it severed thousands of others in the name of puncturing a conflict-made bloated public service, heightened the fears and give the rumor some aura of legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Republic Newspaper confirmed the rumor in a story published recently, stating that Civil Service Agency was working on a full package for the layoff of civil servants. Quoting an anonymous source, the paper said the Agency and government ministries and agencies were consulting over the decision to drop the government workers who were told to stay home as part of measures to limit the spread of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper reported it got a hint about the decision to lay off the public employees and this was due to potential economic uncertainties looming over Liberia as a result of the Ebola outbreak and its impact on government's income generating streams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Minister of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT), Lewis G. Brown, says there is no such plan by government, adding that Government was focusing more on its responsibility to the people of Liberia. Speaking at the Ministry Tuesday, Minister Brown said it is the duty of all Liberians to focus on the current effort to eradicate the Ebola virus, rather than distracting government's effort by negative misinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a government; we do not play those kinds of games,&quot; he said. &quot;We are all under attack from this virus that continues to threaten our country; if people frequently try to distract the nation's focus, it will not be too long until the virus engulfs us all.&quot; He said the extension of the period of stay-home for non-essential government workers was intended to serve the greater interest of the nation and to decongest public places which will subsequently prevent the exponential spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Minister Brown, Government is in constant consultation with officials of the Civil Service Agency and human resource personnel in an effort to explore all available benefit possibilities to make the government manageable which uprightly does not amount to a decision to dismiss employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country is focused on fighting this virus and can never be involved in 'witch-hunt'&quot; he further said. &quot;We have only one enemy and we have to fight it with all our available resources.&quot; The MICAT boss also observed that the President has enormous power in reference to the Constitution of Liberia, but alluded that the only power so desired now is the power to fight Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic activities have grounded to a near halt in Liberia since the outbreak of Ebola. While multilateral and transactional concessionaries are either packed or slowed down, local economic economies are amply disrupted. One vivid evidence is that the farming has come to pass and the predominantly subsistence agriculture population remain berserk with the Ebola pandemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts therefore surmise that by the time Ebola is expunged from the territorial confines of Liberia, the country's economy would have sufficiently slumped and a new battle for recovery will lifts it dire face. Some partners are thinking seriously about that and promising to do something to avert the potentially disastrous impact looming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One group that is looking at post-Ebola Liberia is the United States-based Millennium Challenge Corporation. It has ready pledged its commitment to assisting the government of Liberia in supporting a post-Ebola Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Washington DC over the weekend, the MCC Executive Officer, Ms. Dana J. Hyde, the MCC's Executive Director said it was crucial for the government of Liberia to immediately begin engaging with partners. She made the disclosure during a meeting with the Liberia's Finance and Development Planning Minister Amara Konneh and delegation currently attending the World Bank annual meeting in Washington DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent, bilateral U.S. Government foreign aid agency established by Congress that is based on the principle that aid is most effective when it reinforces good governance, economic prosperity, applying a set of innovative philosophy to foreign aid administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, the MCC and government of Liberia signed a $15 million threshold program grant agreement that focused on improving land rights and access, increasing girls' primary education enrollment and retention, and improving Liberia trade policy and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the possible threat to Liberia's Liberia to achieve all the indicators amidst the Ebola epidemic, Ms. Hyde said, the MCC recognized the impact of the crisis and was willing to work with Liberia in exploring ways to identify areas for medium and long term intervention, possibly including accelerating the disbursement of the initial seed fund to help with the recovery effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to accelerating with a plan to move Liberia forward. We will play key role in the economy recovery. We will do things differently this time. We will definitely partner in the recovery process to help Liberia move forward&quot;, Hyde concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Minister Konneh provided an overview of the government's effort in combating the deadly Ebola virus. Highlighting the efforts of various agencies, including US, he said Ebola has gravely undermined the health system and Liberia's ailing economy, stressing &quot;the thinking and assumption that underpin the economy needs review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing the need for more support to increase its fiscal space and promote macroeconomic stability, Minister Konneh said it is critical for all partners to &quot;sustain our engagement and expedite resources so that when recovery starts, there is money to jump start the post-Ebola recovery activity,&quot; Minister Konneh urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh was accompanied by Deputy Minister of Development Planning, Dr. MounirSiaplay and the President of the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment, Mr. John Davis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UP to ten ebola cases could be seen in Britain by Christmas, the Health Secretary warned last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Hunt told Parliament that the health crisis will get worse before it improves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the death toll in West Africa passed 4,000, Mr Hunt announced that screening for ebola will begin at Heathrow airport today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told MPs: In the next week, Public Health England will start screening and monitoring UK-bound air passengers identified by the Border Force coming on to the main routes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will allow potential ebola virus carriers arriving in the UK to be identified, tracked and given rapid access to expert health advice should they develop symptoms.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation yesterday described the epidemic as the most severe acute health emergency in modern times' as the number of cases hit 8,400, killing 4,030. Screening measures - a questionnaire followed by a possible medical examination and temperature check - will be introduced at Heathrow Terminal 1 today, followed later this week at Gatwick, Eurostar stations and other Heathrow terminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hunt said the procedure should pick up 89 per cent of people travelling from the affected region, and it could be extended to Birmingham and Manchester if the risk increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who tests positive for ebola will be transferred to Royal Free Hospital in north London, where British nurse William Pooley, 29, was successfully treated when he contracted the virus in August. There are also plans to provide ebola surge wards' in Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield, to make a total of 26 beds available. The situation will get worse before it gets better,' he told the Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was genuinely very difficult' to predict an exact number of UK cases but, when pushed, said up to ten would be expected in the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hunt admitted he could not guarantee UK patients would receive the experimental drug ZMapp that was given to Mr Pooley. The Health Secretary also announced that calls to the NHS's non-emergency 111 phoneline will be screened for potential ebola sufferers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical experts have criticised the screening - which stops short of the automated temperature scanning introduced by the US - as a political gesture'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ability of NHS hospitals to deal with ebola was called into question after reports that one patient suspected to have the virus was allowed to receive visitors and use a communal toilet and kitchen at Lewisham Hospital, South London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patient, later given the all-clear, was only isolated when staff reportedly refused to go near him. Mr Hunt said the case highlighted, the importance of making sure that the guidance is widely understood'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlining the potential turmoil, WHO director-general Margaret Chan said yesterday: I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA screening will begin at Heathrow airport today, with critics of the policy claiming it will do little but cause disruption to passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, announced yesterday that passengers arriving on major routes from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia would face temperature checks and questions about their movements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week Public Health England ruled out such measures, claiming they would target only &quot;huge numbers of low-risk people&quot;. However, Mr Hunt told the House of Commons that medical advice had changed, and warned that Ebola would be in Britain by Christmas. Enhanced screening will be implemented at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Hunt said that 89 per cent of people travelling to Britain from West Africa would be checked, but admitted that one in 10 taking indirect routes would slip through screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told MPs it was &quot;likely&quot; that Ebola will arrive in Britain and a &quot;handful&quot; of cases could be confirmed in the next three months. &quot;This Government's first priority is the safety of the British people,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health experts questioned whether the enhanced screening would prevent the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Ron Behrens, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the benefit of airport screening would be &quot;very small&quot;, while there would be disruption to &quot;large numbers of people&quot;. He said: &quot;It appears not to be a scientific decision but a political one.&quot; Dr Ben Neuman, of the University of Reading, said screening would be made harder by the beginning of the flu season. &quot;In the early stages, Ebola can be indistinguishable from the flu, but it can also have aspects of other winter viruses like colds and norovirus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These diseases usually develop differently over a few days, but in a situation where a screener only gets one chance to decide whether a passenger is an Ebola risk, other winter diseases will probably be mistaken for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would not surprise me if airport screening measures mainly caught unfortunate passengers with seasonal ailments who were unlucky enough to have recently been to Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Derek Macallan, professor of infectious diseases and medicine at St George's University of London, also agreed that screening would prove &quot;really difficult&quot;, but added: &quot;If it raises awareness for people with fevers who have travelled abroad to seek medical advice, then it can only be a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Hunt said plans were in place should there be a need for a &quot;surge&quot; in bed capacity to treat Ebola cases. Whitehall's Cobra emergency committee will meet tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak in West Africa shows no signs of slowing and measures to screen passengers could be in place for many months. The disease has claimed 4,033 lives, and a further 8,399 people across seven countries are believed to be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first American to contract Ebola in the US was yesterday identified by her family as Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth. Texas. Doctors described the nurse's condition as &quot;clinically stable&quot;.</SPAN></P>

In fact, nobody has yet seen fit to instigate such a helpline or home assessment by specialist teams.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A virus that could burn itself out in Africa would have no chance to do so in London because of the population density. An outbreak (and subsequent imposition of martial law) in London would cost hundreds of billions of pounds, but the cost of basic measures just millions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Department of Health's overreaction to bird flu and the subsequent money wasted on Tamiflu should not make us complacent about Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its arrival in Britain is almost certain, but not necessarily from west Africa. The worst outcome would be a significant outbreak in rural areas of Eastern Europe that have little epidemiological experience and a migrant workforce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA screening will begin at Heathrow airport today, with critics of the policy claiming it will do little but cause disruption to passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, announced yesterday that passengers arriving from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia would face temperature checks and questions about their movements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week Public Health England ruled out such measures, claiming they would target only &quot;huge numbers of low-risk people&quot;. However, Mr Hunt told the House of Commons that medical advice had changed, and warned that Ebola would be in Britain by Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Enhanced screening will also be implemented at Gatwick and Eurostar terminals next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Hunt said that 89 per cent of people travelling to Britain from West Africa would be checked, but admitted that one in 10 taking indirect routes would slip through screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But health experts questioned whether the enhanced screening would prevent the disease. Dr Ron Behrens, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the benefit of airport screening would be &quot;very small&quot;, while there would be disruption to &quot;large numbers of people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;It appears not to be a scientific decision but a political one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Ben Neuman, of the University of Reading, said screening would be made harder by the beginning of the flu season. &quot;In the early stages, Ebola can be indistinguishable from the flu, but it can also have aspects of other winter viruses like colds and norovirus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These diseases usually develop differently over a few days, but in a situation where a screener only gets one chance to decide whether a passenger is an Ebola risk, other winter diseases will probably be mistaken for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would not surprise me if airport screening measures mainly caught unfortunate passengers with seasonal ailments who were unlucky enough to have recently been to Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Derek Macallan, professor of infectious diseases and medicine at St George's University of London, also agreed that screening would prove &quot;really difficult&quot;, but added: &quot;If it raises awareness for people with fevers who have travelled abroad to seek medical advice, then it can only be a good thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak in West Africa shows no signs of slowing and measures to screen passengers could be in place for many months. The disease has claimed 4,033 lives, and a further 8,399 people across seven countries are believed to be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first American to contract Ebola in the US was yesterday identified by her family as Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth. Texas. Doctors described the nurse's condition as &quot;clinically stable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miss Pham was part of the medical team that treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who brought the virus to America and died in Dallas Presbyterian Hospital last week.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers will have their temperatures taken in a check for suspected Ebola at Heathrow Terminal 1 from today but it will be impossible to check all the 1,000 people a month arriving from the worst-affected countries, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt said it was likely that Ebola would be diagnosed in the UK by the end of the year but the best estimates suggested there would probably be fewer than 10 cases over the next three months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimated 89% of passengers to the UK from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would be identified by screening at the border but the authorities are relying to some extent on travellers &quot;self-presenting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt faced questions from MPs about why there would be no screening of passengers who arrive through regional airports and why checks at Gatwick, Eurostar and other Heathrow terminals could not be brought in sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration Services Union (ISU), representing some 5,000 UK border staff, also described the plans as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot;, saying all passengers should be screened as they alight from the aircraft rather than at border control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucy Moreton, ISU general secretary, said: &quot;They are asking passengers who believe that they may have been in contact with infected persons to self-refer. They have to present themselves to the Public Health England individual who is located behind the arrivals control, some 300 or 400 hundred metres behind and around a corner. You have to go and seek them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers have so far spent &pound;125m on emergency preparations and tackling the virus at its source in west Africa, where it has caused 4,033 deaths and more than 8,000 suspected cases. The UK government has sent 750 troops to Africa to help deal with containment, while more than 650 NHS staff and 130 Public Health England staff have volunteered to go out to Sierra Leone, where the British are taking a leading role in international aid efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no direct flights to the UK from affected west African countries but there are indirect routes via mainland Europe. Hunt told the House of Commons yesterday that a fever test would now be included, on top of a medical risk questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients,&quot; Hunt told MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Passengers identified as having any level of increased risk of Ebola, but without any symptoms, will be given a Public Health England contact number to call should they develop any symptoms consistent with Ebola within the 21-day incubation period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour MP John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington seat includes Heathrow, questioned who would carry out the screening following the government's decision to close Heathrow's health control unit this year. Hunt insisted 200 staff would be ready to start conducting checks. The health secretary said operators of the 111 medical helpline, GPs, nurses and NHS receptionists had all received information on how to identify the symptoms of Ebola, which include respiratory problems, high temperatures, diarrhoea and vomiting. In the UK, 26 beds have been made available at hospitals to deal with potential cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, welcomed the preparations but criticised the government for its &quot;confusion&quot; last week over whether there would be screening at UK borders. Hunt said the government modified its position after the advice from Dame Sally Davies, the UK chief medical officer, changed last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians across the world began to act after UN raised the alarm that Ebola is spreading &quot;exponentially&quot; in west Africa and set a three-month deadline to get the deadly virus under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also warned the epidemic is the &quot;most severe acute health emergency in modern times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO director general, Margaret Chan, said: &quot;I have never seen an outbreak of infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is Ebola spread?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus is transmitted in the bodily fluids of people who are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seriously ill, who are likely to be vomiting, bleeding or have diarrhoea. Blood, faeces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, and in late stages of the disease even tiny amounts can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carry high loads of virus. But a nurse who got a patient's blood on their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hands could wash it off with soap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and water without any ill-effects. He</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or she would become ill only if they had a cut or abrasion on their hand or touched their mouth, eyes or nose, which would allow the virus to pass</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into their bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the symptoms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can take two to 21 days for symptoms to show, although usually it is five to seven days. Typically, the first signs are a fever involving a headache, joint and muscle pain, sore throat and severe muscle weakness. Many of those symptoms are similar to flu, so Ebola is not immediately obvious, though it should be suspected in anyone who has been in west Africa recently. After that come diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash and stomach pain. The kidneys and liver stop working properly. Patients may bleed internally and also from the ears, nose, eyes and mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about sweat - for example could I get Ebola from using gym equipment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. No one who had Ebola and was symptomatic, with intense muscle weakness and a fever in the early stages, would be well enough to go to the gym - and until they are symptomatic, they are not infectious. Sweat, anyway, is probably not a source of large amounts of virus - in fact, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says whole live virus has never been isolated from sweat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about saliva?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO says saliva at the most severe stage of the disease, and also tears, may carry some risk, but the studies are inconclusive. The virus has been detected in breast milk. A 2007 study</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the Journal of Infectious Diseases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is probably the most informative on where the virus hides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can I get Ebola from a toilet seat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes - faeces from somebody who has Ebola are a real hazard and the virus has also been detected in urine. But there would only be a danger if a seriously sick person had used the toilet and contaminated it and that is most likely in their home or hospital. Public toilets, in general, are very unlikely to be a risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can it be sexually transmitted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, and the virus lasts in the semen of people who have recovered, maybe for as long as 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could I catch Ebola from using a taxi that has taken a patient to hospital?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus can be transmitted on surfaces that bodily fluids have touched, so if somebody had bled or vomited on the seat, there would be a risk to anyone who had a cut or touched their face with contaminated hands. In Europe or the US, if a patient was diagnosed with Ebola, there would be a massive effort from the public health authorities to trace their movements as well as their contacts. Any taxi they had travelled in while sick would have to be decontaminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could I catch Ebola from door handles a patient had touched?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, if the handle was contaminated with blood, vomit or faeces, which would be more likely in the house where the patient had been living when they fell sick, or in the hospital. But if people have intact skin, do not touch their eyes, nose or mouth and frequently wash their hands, they will not get infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What can be done in railway stations, schools or other public places to prevent contagion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are strict decontamination procedures by Public Health England that must be followed. Any area visibly contaminated - where there is blood, vomit or faeces - and toilets and surfaces lots of people touch, such as door handles and telephones, must be wiped with disposable towels to remove any visible fluids, then cleaned with detergent or soap and water and allowed to dry. Then they must be disinfected, for instance with diluted bleach - one part bleach to four parts water. Those who do the cleaning must be fully covered, with long-sleeved shirts tucked into disposable gloves and trousers tucked into socks and closed shoes. Any cuts or abrasions must be covered with plasters. But there is no need to clean corridors or areas that the person has just passed through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long can the virus survive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus is quite fragile and is easily destroyed by UV light, drying out, high temperatures (which is helpful in west Africa) and disinfectants including soapy water and alcohol gel. The longest it is likely to survive is a few days, if left in a pool of bodily fluid in a cool, damp place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is food safe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, if it is cooked. The Ebola virus is inactivated through cooking. Raw bush meat is a risk. Past outbreaks of Ebola in Africa came from the hunting, butchering and preparing of bush meat for people to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Ebola virus airborne? Should I be wearing a mask?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. The virus is not airborne. Despite the speculation, the UN Ebola Mission for Emergency Response says extensive studies of the virus have not shown any airborne transmission. Patients do not cough and sneeze a lot with this disease and the WHO states in an advisory notice: &quot;Epidemiological data emerging from the outbreak are not consistent with the pattern of spread seen with airborne viruses, like those that cause measles and chickenpox, or the airborne bacterium that causes tuberculosis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if someone were to cough or sneeze in my face?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a theoretical possibility that a person heavily infected with Ebola could cough violently and send wet, heavy droplets into the face of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone nearby. The person who is most at risk of catching Ebola this way would be whoever is nursing the patient, and they would hopefully be wearing protective clothing, including a mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could the Ebola virus mutate to change the way it is transmitted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although viruses do mutate, scientists say no virus, to their knowledge, has changed its mode of transmission, and there is no evidence that it is happening with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are spaceman-style protective suits any good, given that some health workers wearing them have got Ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They work as long as they are used properly. There are strict procedures for taking them off when the gloves and outside of the suit may be covered in virus. The US Centers for Disease Control has a guide for safe removal, to ensure bare hands do not touch contaminated material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are scanners the answer for detecting infected people entering the UK?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. All that scanners can detect are raised body temperatures. That could be caused by a cold virus or even the menopause, rather than Ebola. Every person with a raised temperature would then have to have a blood test for Ebola. There are two other problems: people could arrive from west Africa by any port, not least because airlines are not flying directly here from affected countries, so logically there would have to be scanners also at the seaports and the Channel tunnel. And the biggest issue is that people are likely to arrive in the days before symptoms show, so they will not have a high temperature and there is no way to know they are carrying Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American health authorities need to urgently rethink how to deal with Ebola, a senior health official said yesterday as officials in Texas scrambled to identify all hospital staff involved in the care of a Liberian man who last week became the first casualty from the virus in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 50 hospital workers are believed to have had contact with Thomas Duncan, who died last Wednesday, including a nurse who was confirmed on Sunday as having contracted the virus in the first case of Ebola transmission in the US and the second outside Africa. The nurse was identified yesterday by Dallas TV station WFAA as Nina Pham, 26.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection and control because even a single infection is unacceptable,&quot; Tom Frieden, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a press conference. If this one individual was infected within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well. So we consider them to potentially be at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal and state health officials are working together to identify and interview the healthcare workers involved in Duncan's treatment, as well as anyone Pham may have made contact with once she began showing symptoms. Frieden said Pham was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain's foreign affairs minister defended his government's decision to repatriate two Spanish nationals suffering from Ebola, which led to a nurse who treated them becoming the first person to contract the virus outside west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government did what it had to do,&quot; Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told El Pais newspaper. &quot;The duty of a state is to protect its citizens - and even more so when they are in difficult circumstances far from Spain. All the developed countries who have had this problem have done the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missionaries, Miguel Pajares, 75, and Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, died in August and September, days after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish nurse, Teresa Romero Ramos, tested positive for the Ebola virus shortly afterwards. She remains in a stable but serious condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, in a phone interview from her hospital bed, Romero Ramos told El Pais that she may have touched her face with her gloves while removing her protective suit. She later told the Spanish broadcaster Cuatro that she had been given little training on how to put on and take off the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Healthcare workers around the world are on the frontline of the worst outbreak of Ebola. The director general of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan, described the crisis yesterday as the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the number of new cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was rising exponentially, adding: &quot;The world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained and threatening public health emergency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to a regional health conference in the Philippine capital, Manila, she said: &quot;I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries. I have never seen an infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia yesterday, the National Health Workers Association of Liberia (NHWAL) called for its members to strike, demanding better protection against the virus. George Williams, the NHWAL's secretary general, said: &quot;The public is aware that health workers are dying because they are not protected. We have been calling on the government to give us protective gear but they are not doing so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many health workers were reported to have turned up for work, defying the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret Chan, the WHO's director general, said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crisis was the most severe acute public health emergency</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was working as a travel nurse at a children's hospital in California when I got an email from International Medical Corps asking if I was interested in deploying to Liberia to help fight Ebola. I wanted to go immediately but I was locked into a contract. The more I heard, the more excited I got. Within three days of finishing my contract, I was in Alabama being trained in how to treat Ebola patients safely and within a week I was in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have now been at the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) for two weeks and what an incredible experience it has been. This week, I am on the night shift so my working day starts at 7pm. Tonight, we have 12 patients in the unit who are confirmed as having the Ebola virus. One is a nine-year-old girl who came with her mother when they were both sick. Her mum tested negative for Ebola but unfortunately the girl tested positive. Her mother opted to go home, leaving her daughter behind. She is very weak and really scared now that she is here all alone, so I am going to spend extra time with her tonight, feeding her to try to get her strength back up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our personal protective equipment (PPE) suits get really hot. We spend up to two hours at a time in the ETU with the patients, which is about the longest you can comfortably remain inside the suits without a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am worried about the backlash against healthcare workers who are responding to the crisis in West Africa. I have heard media reports calling for people such as me who have been treating Ebola patients to be quarantined for 21 or even 42 days. These ideas are not based on the medical facts. People only need to be quarantined if they are showing symptoms and if you do not have a fever, there is no risk of you transmitting Ebola to someone. We work really hard here, the hours are long and the work is physically and emotionally tiring. When we get time off every six weeks, I would like to think I can travel anywhere I want to but I suspect we are reaching a situation where I am not going to be welcome in many places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four new patients arrived at around midnight in ambulances. Tonight we saw a father and two sons: the dad is really very sick, throwing up every few minutes. We gave him and the other patients plenty of fluids and medicine to help with the vomiting and then we took the blood test that would confirm whether or not they had the Ebola virus. After triaging the patients, we made our way to the confirmed ward to carry the body of a patient who had died earlier in the night to the morgue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sun comes up around 6am, and the team on the nightshift often get together to watch it. Our Liberian colleagues will start singing and we will have a dance around for a few minutes. It's a small thing but after a long night, when you have had patients die, it is a very emotional time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My shift finishes at 7am after I have handed over to the daytime crew. We will be back doing exactly the same again tomorrow night. That is a fairly typical night in the ETU: not too scary, at times even fun, and hopefully we are doing great things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is mean. It's harsh and it can tear families apart one by one, or take them all out together. We recently had a teenage girl bleed to death over two days of IV-site oozing. Sounds easy to fix, right? Pressure dressing, elevation, blah blah. Sorry, that's not how things work in an Ebola unit. You do all the normal interventions but a 20-gauge needle hole in a hand can slowly and fully drain the life source out of someone. Walking into a room that is covered in blood, finding a semi-conscious girl face down on a bed pooling with barely congealed blood is hard. It's harder the second day when you know all your efforts couldn't slow that life destruction. I cleaned her up, and put her in a pair of still-tagged jeans. She half smiled and took some medicines. I won't forget her smile. Nor her soft moans as her body was fading away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, I carried a baby to the tent morgue. The baby's father had died days earlier in the ambulance ride to our ETU. The baby tested positive for malaria. We are still waiting for Ebola tests to come back on the mother and baby. The floppy, listless baby seemed to be turning a corner last night at 10. He smiled and took medicine willingly. His mother, lying near him, was vomiting and too weak to care for him any more. We went back inside a second time at 4am and stayed a while. Baby drank and we tried to get him to learn how to drink from a bottle so he could fend for himself. I came out joyed at baby's bounceback! At around 5.30am, the mother came out crying. Baby had died. It was a shock and a testament to how rapidly situations can change. On the trip in to get the baby, two more patients had expired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high elation for our recovered patients is what it is because of the contrast of the deep sorrows of the many lows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not slowing down yet. I am trying my hardest to encourage everyone to drink through the nausea and vomiting, to eat, and to try to have hope of recovery. Nursing wise, we are doing high-level care. But the focus is getting OK care to more people than good care to just a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have obviously had a hard few days and I am sorry for being graphic. But this is what it really is like being in Liberia during Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a happy day: 11-year-old Kadiatu and 35-year-old Osman are being discharged as our first two Ebola survivors. Their blood tests have come back negative - they are no longer infectious and can safely return to their families and communities. For the whole week we have been separated by 1.5 metre-high orange fencing. I have been throwing &quot;plumpinut&quot; (a nutritious peanut paste) and biscuits across the fence to Kadiatu, and we have been talking, singing and even dancing for the past two days - from our separate sides. Today, there is no more fence between us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first week as a community health delegate at the centre, run by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, has been a surreal rollercoaster between life and death, hope, grief, pain and joy. My first task was to oversee four burials. As a team in full PPE carried the corpses in double body bags out of the morgue, we were there to pay our last respects and to make sure the burial site was mapped and the graves marked. The sad fact is that there will be many more graves as the centre will admit more patients, and some of them will lose the battle against the virus. One of the bodies that day was an eight-year-old boy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we returned from the burial site, the boy's family had arrived to ask for news about him. His father had already died from Ebola, but his uncle and brother came all the way from Freetown, a five-hour drive away. The two men had been in contact with people with Ebola and therefore might be infected and carriers of the virus, so we could not bring them into the low-risk area. Nor could they see their nephew and brother. We brought them instead to the unused triage area, where we could speak in private, with the safe orange fencing between us. They don't say much at the news of the boy's death. There is a nod of understanding, but their faces express shock and disbelief. At the end of the day, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do this for a whole month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiatu was one of the first patients at the centre, and because she had been inside the high-risk area she had to go through the &quot;happy shower&quot; before she could be discharged: a chlorine bath followed by a normal soapy shower to remove all potential remains of the virus. Her contaminated clothes were destroyed and she was given a new dress and sandals. When she came out she was clean, uncontaminated and safe. She turned around to wave to Haja - another Ebola patient who has been taking care of Kadiatu inside - and walked out past the double orange fencing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we wait for her transport home to Freetown, we can finally sit together. Kadiatu is brought breakfast and vitamins, but the nurses no longer need to wear PPE, and the psychosocial counsellor can talk to her in private and uninterrupted. Kadiatu makes us dance for her as she sings, and we can take photos together without being worried about coming too close. Magically, our first survivor is this beautiful, strong 11-year-old with the widest, whitest smile I have ever seen, and as the car drives off I know she will be fine. Her mother and siblings are waiting for her at home, and for us, the staff at the treatment centre, we know that people can survive Ebola and that there will be many more happy days like this one in the midst of all the fear and despair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers will have their temperatures taken in a check for suspected Ebola at Heathrow Terminal 1 from today but it will be impossible to check all the 1,000 people a month arriving from the worst-affected countries, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt said it was likely that Ebola would be diagnosed in the UK by the end of the year but the best estimates suggested there would probably be fewer than 10 cases over the next three months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimated 89% of passengers to the UK from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would be identified by screening at the border but the authorities are relying to some extent on travellers &quot;self-presenting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt faced questions from MPs about why there would be no screening of passengers who arrive through regional airports and why checks at Gatwick, Eurostar and other Heathrow terminals could not be brought in sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Immigration Services Union (ISU), representing some 5,000 UK border staff, also described the plans as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot;, saying all passengers should be screened as they alight from the aircraft rather than at border control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucy Moreton, ISU general secretary, said: &quot;They are asking passengers who believe that they may have been in contact with infected persons to self-refer. They have to present themselves to the Public Health England individual who is located behind the arrivals control, some 300 or 400 hundred metres behind and around a corner. You have to go and seek them out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers have so far spent &pound;125m on emergency preparations and tackling the virus at its source in west Africa, where it has caused 4,033 deaths and more than 8,000 suspected cases. The UK government has sent 750 troops to Africa to help deal with containment, while more than 650 NHS staff and 130 Public Health England staff have volunteered to go out to Sierra Leone, where the British are taking a leading role in international aid efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no direct flights to the UK from affected west African countries but there are indirect routes via mainland Europe. Hunt told the House of Commons yesterday that a fever test would now be included, on top of a medical risk questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients,&quot; Hunt told MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Passengers identified as having any level of increased risk of Ebola, but without any symptoms, will be given a Public Health England contact number to call should they develop any symptoms consistent with Ebola within the 21-day incubation period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour MP John McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington seat includes Heathrow, questioned who would carry out the screening following the government's decision to close Heathrow's health control unit this year. Hunt insisted 200 staff would be ready to start conducting checks. The health secretary said operators of the 111 medical helpline, GPs, nurses and NHS receptionists had all received information on how to identify the symptoms of Ebola, which include respiratory problems, high temperatures, diarrhoea and vomiting. In the UK, 26 beds have been made available at hospitals to deal with potential cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, welcomed the preparations but criticised the government for its &quot;confusion&quot; last week over whether there would be screening at UK borders. Hunt said the government modified its position after the advice from Dame Sally Davies, the UK chief medical officer, changed last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians across the world began to act after UN raised the alarm that Ebola is spreading &quot;exponentially&quot; in west Africa and set a three-month deadline to get the deadly virus under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also warned the epidemic is the &quot;most severe acute health emergency in modern times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO director general, Margaret Chan, said: &quot;I have never seen an outbreak of infectious disease contribute so strongly to potential state failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Boseley, Health correspondent</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUARDIAN HOME PAGES; Pg. 16</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1173 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is Ebola spread?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebola virus is transmitted in the bodily fluids of people who are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seriously ill, who are likely to be vomiting, bleeding or have diarrhoea. Blood, faeces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, and in late stages of the disease even tiny amounts can carry high loads of virus. But a nurse who got a patient's blood on their hands could wash it off with soap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and water without any ill-effects. He or she would become ill only if they had a cut or abrasion on their hand or touched their mouth, eyes or nose, which would allow the virus to pass into their bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the symptoms?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can take two to 21 days for symptoms to show, although usually it is five to seven days. Typically, the first signs are a fever involving a headache, joint and muscle pain, sore throat and severe muscle weakness. Many of those symptoms are similar to flu, so Ebola is not immediately obvious, though it should be suspected in anyone who has been in west Africa recently. After that come diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash and stomach pain. The kidneys and liver stop working properly. Patients may bleed internally and also from the ears, nose, eyes and mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about sweat - for example could I get Ebola from using gym equipment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. No one who had Ebola and was symptomatic, with intense muscle weakness and a fever in the early stages, would be well enough to go to the gym - and until they are symptomatic, they are not infectious. Sweat, anyway, is probably not a source of large amounts of virus - in fact, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says whole live virus has never been isolated from sweat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about saliva?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO says saliva at the most severe stage of the disease, and also tears, may carry some risk, but the studies are inconclusive. The virus has been detected in breast milk. A 2007 study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is probably the most informative on where the virus hides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can I get Ebola from a toilet seat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes - faeces from somebody who has Ebola are a real hazard and the virus has also been detected in urine. But there would only be a danger if a seriously sick person had used the toilet and contaminated it and that is most likely in their home or hospital. Public toilets, in general, are very unlikely to be a risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can it be sexually transmitted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, and the virus lasts in the semen of people who have recovered, maybe for as long as 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could I catch Ebola from using a taxi that has taken a patient to hospital?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus can be transmitted on surfaces that bodily fluids have touched, so if somebody had bled or vomited on the seat, there would be a risk to anyone who had a cut or touched their face with contaminated hands. In Europe or the US, if a patient was diagnosed with Ebola, there would be a massive effort from the public health authorities to trace their movements as well as their contacts. Any taxi they had travelled in while sick would have to be decontaminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could I catch Ebola from door handles a patient had touched?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, if the handle was contaminated with blood, vomit or faeces, which would be more likely in the house where the patient had been living when they fell sick, or in the hospital. But if people have intact skin, do not touch their eyes, nose or mouth and frequently wash their hands, they will not get infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What can be done in railway stations, schools or other public places to prevent contagion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are strict decontamination procedures by Public Health England that must be followed. Any area visibly contaminated - where there is blood, vomit or faeces - and toilets and surfaces lots of people touch, such as door handles and telephones, must be wiped with disposable towels to remove any visible fluids, then cleaned with detergent or soap and water and allowed to dry. Then they must be disinfected, for instance with diluted bleach - one part bleach to four parts water. Those who do the cleaning must be fully covered, with long-sleeved shirts tucked into disposable gloves and trousers tucked into socks and closed shoes. Any cuts or abrasions must be covered with plasters. But there is no need to clean corridors or areas that the person has just passed through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long can the virus survive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus is quite fragile and is easily destroyed by UV light, drying out, high temperatures (which is helpful in west Africa) and disinfectants including soapy water and alcohol gel. The longest it is likely to survive is a few days, if left in a pool of bodily fluid in a cool, damp place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is food safe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, if it is cooked. The Ebola virus is inactivated through cooking. Raw bush meat is a risk. Past outbreaks of Ebola in Africa came from the hunting, butchering and preparing of bush meat for people to eat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Ebola virus airborne? Should I be wearing a mask?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. The virus is not airborne. Despite the speculation, the UN Ebola Mission for Emergency Response says extensive studies of the virus have not shown any airborne transmission. Patients do not cough and sneeze a lot with this disease and the WHO states in an advisory notice: &quot;Epidemiological data emerging from the outbreak are not consistent with the pattern of spread seen with airborne viruses, like those that cause measles and chickenpox, or the airborne bacterium that causes tuberculosis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if someone were to cough or sneeze in my face?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a theoretical possibility that a person heavily infected with Ebola could cough violently and send wet, heavy droplets into the face of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">someone nearby. The person who is most at risk of catching Ebola this way would be whoever is nursing the patient, and they would hopefully be wearing protective clothing, including a mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could the Ebola virus mutate to change the way it is transmitted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although viruses do mutate, scientists say no virus, to their knowledge, has changed its mode of transmission, and there is no evidence that it is happening with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are spaceman-style protective suits any good, given that some health workers wearing them have got Ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They work as long as they are used properly. There are strict procedures for taking them off when the gloves and outside of the suit may be covered in virus. The US Centers for Disease Control has a guide for safe removal, to ensure bare hands do not touch contaminated material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are scanners the answer for detecting infected people entering the UK?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. All that scanners can detect are raised body temperatures. That could be caused by a cold virus or even the menopause, rather than Ebola. Every person with a raised temperature would then have to have a blood test for Ebola. There are two other problems: people could arrive from west Africa by any port, not least because airlines are not flying directly here from affected countries, so logically there would have to be scanners also at the seaports and the Channel tunnel. And the biggest issue is that people are likely to arrive in the days before symptoms show, so they will not have a high temperature and there is no way to know they are carrying Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American health authorities need to urgently rethink how to deal with Ebola, a senior health official said yesterday as officials in Texas scrambled to identify all hospital staff involved in the care of a Liberian man who last week became the first casualty from the virus in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 50 hospital workers are believed to have had contact with Thomas Duncan, who died last Wednesday, including a nurse who was confirmed on Sunday as having contracted the virus in the first case of Ebola transmission in the US and the second outside Africa. The nurse was identified yesterday by Dallas TV station WFAA as Nina Pham, 26.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection and control because even a single infection is unacceptable,&quot; Tom Frieden, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said at a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this one individual was infected within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well. So we consider them to potentially be at risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal and state health officials are working together to identify and interview the healthcare workers involved in Duncan's treatment, as well as anyone Pham may have made contact with once she began showing symptoms. Frieden said Pham was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barack Obama urged his top national security and public health officials to incorporate lessons from the Texas Ebola infection into the US's response plans. He also called on the international community to deliver assistance more quickly to the countries of west Africa that are struggling against the disease. In a telephone call with the French president, Francois Hollande, Obama also discussed the need for treatment facilities in west Africa and steps needed to prevent the spread of Ebola outside the affected region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain's foreign affairs minister defended his government's decision to repatriate two Spanish nationals suffering from Ebola, which led to a nurse who treated them becoming the first person to contract the virus outside west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government did what it had to do,&quot; Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told El Pais newspaper. &quot;The duty of a state is to protect its citizens - and even more so when they are in difficult circumstances far from Spain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missionaries, Miguel Pajares, 75, and Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, died in August and September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish nurse, Teresa Romero Ramos, tested positive for the Ebola virus shortly afterwards. She remains in a stable but serious condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, in a phone interview from hospital, Romero Ramos told El Pais that she may have touched her face with her gloves while removing her protective suit. She later told the Spanish broadcaster Cuatro that she had been given little training on how to put on and take off the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Healthcare workers around the world are on the frontline of the outbreak. The head of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan, described the crisis yesterday as the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chan said the number of new cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was rising exponentially, adding: &quot;The world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained and threatening public health emergency.&quot; She told a health conference in the Philippines: &quot;I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Health Workers Association of Liberia called a strike for better protection against the virus. George Williams, its secretary general, said: &quot;We have been calling on the government to give us protective gear but they are not doing so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many health workers were reported to have turned up for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

Experts predict there could be 1.4 million cases by January: Three nurses who volunteered to help fight the virus in the worst-affected countries describe the daily horror: 'At dawn, we often have a sing and a dance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was working as a travel nurse at a children's hospital in California when I got an email from International Medical Corps asking if I was interested in deploying to Liberia to help fight Ebola. I wanted to go immediately but I was locked into a contract. The more I heard, the more excited I got. Within three days of finishing my contract, I was in Alabama being trained in how to treat Ebola patients safely and within a week I was in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have now been at the Ebola treatment unit (ETU) for two weeks and what an incredible experience it has been. This week, I am on the night shift so my working day starts at 7pm. Tonight, we have 12 patients in the unit who are confirmed as having the Ebola virus. One is a nine-year-old girl who came with her mother when they were both sick. Her mum tested negative for Ebola but unfortunately the girl tested positive. Her mother opted to go home, leaving her daughter behind. She is very weak and really scared now that she is here all alone, so I am going to spend extra time with her tonight, feeding her to try to get her strength back up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our personal protective equipment (PPE) suits get really hot. We spend up to two hours at a time in the ETU with the patients, which is about the longest you can comfortably remain inside the suits without a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am worried about the backlash against healthcare workers who are responding to the crisis in West Africa. I have heard media reports calling for people such as me who have been treating Ebola patients to be quarantined for 21 or even 42 days. These ideas are not based on the medical facts. People only need to be quarantined if they are showing symptoms and if you do not have a fever, there is no risk of you transmitting Ebola to someone. We work really hard here, the hours are long and the work is physically and emotionally tiring. When we get time off every six weeks, I would like to think I can travel anywhere I want to but I suspect we are reaching a situation where I am not going to be welcome in many places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four new patients arrived at around midnight in ambulances. Tonight we saw a father and two sons: the dad is really very sick, throwing up every few minutes. We gave him and the other patients plenty of fluids and medicine to help with the vomiting and then we took the blood test that would confirm whether or not they had the Ebola virus. After triaging the patients, we made our way to the confirmed ward to carry the body of a patient who had died earlier in the night to the morgue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sun comes up around 6am, and the team on the nightshift often get together to watch it. Our Liberian colleagues will start singing and we will have a dance around for a few minutes. It's a small thing but after a long night, when you have had patients die, it is a very emotional time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My shift finishes at 7am after I have handed over to the daytime crew. We will be back doing exactly the same again tomorrow night. That is a fairly typical night in the ETU: not too scary, at times even fun, and hopefully we are doing great things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is mean. It's harsh and it can tear families apart one by one, or take them all out together. We recently had a teenage girl bleed to death over two days of IV-site oozing. Sounds easy to fix, right? Pressure dressing, elevation, blah blah. Sorry, that's not how things work in an Ebola unit. You do all the normal interventions but a 20-gauge needle hole in a hand can slowly and fully drain the life source out of someone. Walking into a room that is covered in blood, finding a semi-conscious girl face down on a bed pooling with barely congealed blood is hard. It's harder the second day when you know all your efforts couldn't slow that life destruction. I cleaned her up, and put her in a pair of still-tagged jeans. She half smiled and took some medicines. I won't forget her smile. Nor her soft moans as her body was fading away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, I carried a baby to the tent morgue. The baby's father had died days earlier in the ambulance ride to our ETU. The baby tested positive for malaria. We are still waiting for Ebola tests to come back on the mother and baby. The floppy, listless baby seemed to be turning a corner last night at 10. He smiled and took medicine willingly. His mother, lying near him, was vomiting and too weak to care for him any more. We went back inside a second time at 4am and stayed a while. Baby drank and we tried to get him to learn how to drink from a bottle so he could fend for himself. I came out joyed at baby's bounceback! At around 5.30am, the mother came out crying. Baby had died. It was a shock and a testament to how rapidly situations can change. On the trip in to get the baby, two more patients had expired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high elation for our recovered patients is what it is because of the contrast of the deep sorrows of the many lows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is not slowing down yet. I am trying my hardest to encourage everyone to drink through the nausea and vomiting, to eat, and to try to have hope of recovery. Nursing wise, we are doing high-level care. But the focus is getting OK care to more people than good care to just a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have obviously had a hard few days and I am sorry for being graphic. But this is what it really is like being in Liberia during Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the start of the day, I check my hands for any cuts or scrapes that will bar me from donning PPE. Entering the centre, I must wash my hands in a 0.05% chlorine solution. I balance on one foot as someone sprays the bottoms of my shoes with 0.5% chlorine before being allowed entry to the low-risk area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I search for a pair of cold wet boots in my size, which have been soaking in chlorine for the night, and I change into my scrubs. I go straight to the whiteboard to see who has passed away during the night; today, it's one of three nurses who became infected. One is on his way to good health, the other is still hanging on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to synchronise putting the PPE on with other team members, because if one is slower than the rest we end up waiting and baking in the sun. We have a dresser to make sure we are completely covered, or we work in pairs and check each other. First on are gloves and a jumpsuit. Then a second pair of gloves, a thick duckbill mask, a hood, and an apron that is tied by the dresser so we can untie it with one pull. Then on go the goggles with a generous drizzle of antifogging spray, a final check in the mirror and a final check with each other. The checking does not stop there, as we must ensure during our time in the high-risk area that we are still covered, that a mask has not slipped, or that a piece of skin has not been exposed. If that happens, we leave the area immediately. We check the time - 45 minutes to one hour is the maximum allowed in the PPE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have the luxury of four nurses today. Patients who are feeling well enough are sitting on plastic chairs waiting for a meal. We might offer some pain relief, or a smile from beneath our PPE (yes, you can smile with your eyes).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah (not her real name) is sitting outside, greeting us with a big smile. She has lost all her children to Ebola as well as her husband. And here she is asking me how my evening was. The staff tell me she has had some bad moments, but all they can do is reassure her that she is young and can bear more children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have not fared so well - too weak to sit up, or get to the toilet or the shower block. We do our best to offer fluids, a wash and some paracetamol. The local nursing staff have amazing courage. Their families ostracise them, but they still come, to try to bring an end to this brutal, invisible &quot;war&quot;. In Africa, it is usually the family that feeds, washes and comforts the patients. But no family members are allowed inside our centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My three key words are warm, dry and comfortable. Patients who are too weak to move away from their own vomit, faeces and urine need the most help. We clean and care for as many as we can, but if we need to leave the area because of heat exhaustion or feeling unwell, the priority is to get out. You are a danger to your colleagues if you go down in your PPE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After our nursing team goes in, the hygiene team suits up for their rounds. They clean up the vomit, diarrhoea and urine spills, the garbage and the nappies. Their task is monumental and they can be at most risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A minimum of five minutes is needed to undress. We have two tents, where the undressers and sprayers need to be on the ball. The urge to just pull the suit off is strong, but we wait. First, the chlorine spray to the hands. Then we are sprayed from head to toe, first the front, then the back. We wash our hands in 0.5% chlorine. Off come the first set of gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wash our hands again. Off comes the apron and hopefully it was tied perfectly, as we have to blindly reach around to release the knot; we pull it over our heads. Into the chlorine soak it goes. We wash our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next go the goggles. We bend over, close our eyes and gently remove them, dunk them three times in the strong chlorine-filled bucket, and then place them in water. We wash our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hood comes off next. Once again, we bend over, closing our eyes to avoid contamination and dispose of the hood in the garbage. We wash our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, the removal of our heavy PPE. Moving slowly - we do everything slowly here - we carefully expose the zipper, hidden under a taped-down flap. We wash our hands. Blindly, we have to find the zipper, as our undressers and sprayers guide us. We wash our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we shimmy out of our PPE, we are soaked to the bone in sweat, but it feels great. This is the hardest part: to ease off the jumpsuit while kicking your legs back, at the same time standing on it so it doesn't fly away from you. It's a balancing act. The sprayer sprays the entire jumpsuit with a stronger chlorine solution and we put it in the garbage. We wash our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our heavy-duty filtration mask is next. I close my eyes and hope it doesn't catch in my ponytail. We wash our hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last pair of gloves comes off. Our boots are sprayed from all angles and we have to balance on one foot to cross the line from high risk to low risk. We wash our hands and we are done, stripped down to our scrubs, soaked with sweat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I need a rehydration solution or water. No food is allowed in the low-risk area. It is too risky to put anything near your mouth from your hands. But I still see people biting their nails, touching their face, rubbing their eyes - risky but automatic responses. Your hands have been washed a trillion times in chlorine, but still, you don't know how safe your other colleagues have been. You are literally entrusting your life to your work mates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear an ambulance and the siren is going fast - it may pass us and head to the next treatment centre, hours away. But it abruptly turns into our driveway and we run out to greet it. I suit up and prepare for the admissions with a package consisting of a blanket, soap, towel, cup, toothbrush and toothpaste, all in a covered bucket that will be used for vomit/faeces or urine if the person is unable to get to the latrines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambulance door is opened and I can see a man on the stretcher, two legs in the air, stiff as a board. They slowly drop and I realise this patient is dying. But he walked into the ambulance in Freetown. It is a five-hour drive through a dozen checkpoints and deterioration comes rapidly. I pronounce him dead, and move on to the other patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The female patient is lying on the floor between the seat and the stretcher, strapped in by seatbelts. She is trapped, a terrorised look in her eyes. She is flailing wildly, a dangerous situation in itself. I try to calm her while maintaining my distance. We move her as best we can, but then I realise that she is just trying to cover her exposed area below her waist. In her last moments, this is her concern. We manage to get her into a tent. We ask her name, if she is married. She responds, &quot;I am married&quot;, looks away and dies. All that struggle and desperation in the ambulance and she only wanted to preserve her dignity. That was a tough moment.</SPAN></P>

Experts predict there could be 1.4 million cases by January: Three nurses who volunteered to help fight the virus in the worst-affected countries describe the daily horror: 'Magically, our first survivor is this beautiful, strong 11-year-old, with the widest smile I have ever seen': Anine Kongelf, 27, Norwegian Red Cross, Kenema, Sierra Leone</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a happy day: 11-year-old Kadiatu and 35-year-old Osman are being discharged as our first two Ebola survivors. Their blood tests have come back negative - they are no longer infectious and can safely return to their families and communities. For the whole week we have been separated by 1.5 metre-high orange fencing. I have been throwing &quot;plumpinut&quot; (a nutritious peanut paste) and biscuits across the fence to Kadiatu, and we have been talking, singing and even dancing for the past two days - from our separate sides. Today, there is no more fence between us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first week as a community health delegate at the centre, run by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, has been a surreal rollercoaster between life and death, hope, grief, pain and joy. My first task was to oversee four burials. As a team in full PPE carried the corpses in double body bags out of the morgue, we were there to pay our last respects and to make sure the burial site was mapped and the graves marked. The sad fact is that there will be many more graves as the centre will admit more patients, and some of them will lose the battle against the virus. One of the bodies that day was an eight-year-old boy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we returned from the burial site, the boy's family had arrived to ask for news about him. His father had already died from Ebola, but his uncle and brother came all the way from Freetown, a five-hour drive away. The two men had been in contact with people with Ebola and therefore might be infected and carriers of the virus, so we could not bring them into the low-risk area. Nor could they see their nephew and brother. We brought them instead to the unused triage area, where we could speak in private, with the safe orange fencing between us. They don't say much at the news of the boy's death. There is a nod of understanding, but their faces express shock and disbelief. At the end of the day, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do this for a whole month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiatu was one of the first patients at the centre, and because she had been inside the high-risk area she had to go through the &quot;happy shower&quot; before she could be discharged: a chlorine bath followed by a normal soapy shower to remove all potential remains of the virus. Her contaminated clothes were destroyed and she was given a new dress and sandals. When she came out she was clean, uncontaminated and safe. She turned around to wave to Haja - another Ebola patient who has been taking care of Kadiatu inside - and walked out past the double orange fencing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we wait for her transport home to Freetown, we can finally sit together. Kadiatu is brought breakfast and vitamins, but the nurses no longer need to wear PPE, and the psychosocial counsellor can talk to her in private and uninterrupted. Kadiatu makes us dance for her as she sings, and we can take photos together without being worried about coming too close. Magically, our first survivor is this beautiful, strong 11-year-old with the widest, whitest smile I have ever seen, and as the car drives off I know she will be fine. Her mother and siblings are waiting for her at home, and for us, the staff at the treatment centre, we know that people can survive Ebola and that there will be many more happy days like this one in the midst of all the fear and despair.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia (GOL) has pleaded with health workers who are on a 'go slow' action to continue doing their work as all is being done to pay them the full amount of their hazard or risk allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health workers, most of whom are working at the Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) are on a 'go slow' in demand for their risk or hazard allowances which were promised them by government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the plea yesterday at the daily Ebola Press Conference held at the Ministry of Information yesterday, Health and Social Welfare Minister, Dr. Walter Gwanigale, said the country's health system is at a cross-road and it is now incumbent upon all Health Care Workers (HCW) to contribute to the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gwanigale said the system is seriously in need especially at a time when the deadly Ebola virus is raging on and it requires the help of HCW to bring the situation under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Gwanigale said although the government promised to give certain amount with the minimum being set at US$700.00, the government will give about US$400.00 and the balance payment will be made next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Government of Liberia is committed to the settlement of the hazard pay which is not part of the monthly salaries for HCW. Dr. Gwanigale said if anyone is on strike because they want the dismissed leadership of the Health workers to be reinstated, they must have well stayed at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those dismissed health workers' leadership will never be reinstated. They will not come back to work thus if anyone is striking to have them reinstated, the striking workers must just stay home,&quot; Minister Gwanigale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Gwanigale who also frowned on the stigmatization of Ebola survivors in communities called on citizens and relatives of these survivors to accept them into their families because they have been healed and studies have proven that they cannot contract Ebola neither can they get others infected with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Gwanigale also noted that government does not have to only pay health worker their hazard pay but manage meager resources to purchase drugs and ensure the reopening of hospitals and health centers that were closed as a result of the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also addressing journalists at the News conference, acting Finance Minister, Dr. James Kollie, said all efforts are underway to pay the health workers risk or hazard pay but same is being done through the banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said those who have account at Ecobank Liberia have been paid and those who do not have an account are being paid on the counter at the bank while those who have accounts at other banks will be paid by issuance of a check to these banks which include G. T. Bank and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we speak, these health care workers are being paid and it is our plea that they do not abandon the sick because of the risk paid. We know that their work is priceless because of the sacrificial services they have been rendering the country especially at the height of this Ebola crisis,&quot; Dr. Kollie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kollie said in the payment of the risk benefit, the Ministry of Finance with the directive of the World Bank, did a comparative analysis of the hazard pay in the three countries affected by Ebola, namely Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia and it was discovered that the payment in Liberia was the highest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting finance Minister said despite all of these analyses, the Government of Liberia is determined to pay the funds with the balance schedule for next month. &quot;We are appealing to our health workers not to give up because we are aware of their sacrificial services,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Kollie said the government is aware of the agreement reached between it and the health workers and promised that all payments will be taken care of, saying &quot; the money for this payment is coming from other countries that are helping us with their tax payers' money and we must be accountable and transparent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia, Francis S. Korkpor Sr., has urged all citizens and foreign nationals residing in the country to be cognizant of the limitations on the exercise of certain constitutional and statutory rights during this period of State Emergency. According to Chief Justice Korkpor during the opening of the October Term of Court, people &quot;must remain cautious, alert and obedient to all measures declared to fight the virus.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He intimated that the constitution authorizes the President to exercise a range of powers and to curtail certain rights otherwise available to citizens and residents of this nation during normal times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Francis Korkpor Sr. said courts will remain open to review cases as part of its normal procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated further that although, the spread of the Ebola virus in the country has worried several persons in the country, but said if fewer measures are not put in place, there is a likelihood that the virus may last longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged all Liberians and foreign nationals in the country to abide by those preventive measures outlined by the Ministry of Health and International Partners including the CDC, World Bank and other developing partners. He said, &quot;Now, while our constitution provides for a government with three co-equal branches, &quot;coordinate&quot; and cooperate with one another during this critical period of our nation to achieve the common goal of eradicating the Ebola virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cooperation by the three branches of the Government especially at this time does not mean that any one branch will relinquish any of its powers to one or the other two branches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Chief Justice Francis S. Korkpor Sr. has called on the Judiciary to collaborate with the National Legislature and the Executive Branches of Governments to every lawful venture and initiative fight the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further intimated that as part of a concrete demonstration of a commitment to fighting the Ebola there has been some healthy measures put in place. &quot;As a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fight the Ebola virus, we must all cooperate in the eradication of the disease,&quot; Chief Justice Korkpor stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, he and his colleagues have resolved to contribute one month salaries and allowances to fighting the Ebola virus at a rate of 25 percent, with other colleagues from other courts planning similar contributions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has renewed her vow to continue to respect the rights of others and will not change her characteristics of tolerance and understanding people's attitudes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She promised to remain engaged with all those who mean good for the country and no amount of disrespect to the presidency will deter her from performing her constitutional duties. &quot;You can be assured that whatever we do, we do it for the good of this country and my own tolerance, understanding, and respect for the rights of others will never change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Liberian leader made the assertion at the end of a prayer service for the country at the Dominion Christian Fellowship Center on Tubman Boulevard on Friday, October 10, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia leader said despite the seriousness of the Ebola fight, there were still some elements of the Liberian society playing politics with the situation. But President Sirleaf assured the congregation that with her engagement with partners, there is now enormous international support coming to Liberia and if Liberians unite in the fight, they will soon reverse the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She admonished all Liberians to continue to pray and at the same time observe all the anti-Ebola measures as released by health authorities and experts. &quot;We have to follow their advice because we want to make sure that we kick this disease out of our country, region and the world which is concerned that it's beginning to also affect them,&quot; President Sirleaf said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader's comments were in response to a sermon delivered by Bishop Isaac Winker in which he spoke of total disrespect to the presidency especially by the young people of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Winker said young Liberians were now using the various radio talk shows to abuse free speech and called on them to have a change in attitude. &quot;If you wish to be a national leader tomorrow, it's time now that you gain respect from the people by equally addressing the presidency and other national leaders with respect and dignity,&quot; Bishop Winker told the young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, Liberians accused others of being paid agents whenever they are told the truth about the need to respect the office of the President and by this, he said did not have any regret for saying this as he was mandated by God to tell the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Winker, during the sermon, delivered a special prayer for Liberia against those he said are bent on preaching war in the country as God has and will always destroy their plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;War mongers,&quot; the Bishop said, &quot;are destined for self-destruction as the church will continue to pray and thank God for the ten years of uninterrupted peace that the country recently celebrated since its return to the rule of law through Presidential and Legislative elections in 2005 that brought President Sirleaf to power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service was the seventh edition of a national tarry organized by the church of Liberia and held at the Dominium Christian Fellowship Center of the Isaac Winker Global Ministry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip N. Wesseh</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1158 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, I have observed and continue to observe that whenever there are issues of national concern or debate, there would always be different angles, apart from the main issues. In other words, as the debate continues on the main issues, such a situation would produce other issues that are also of public interest or reference. In the field of journalism, which is a subset of mass communication, this is referred to as the &quot;Side Bar,' while the cardinal issue of discussion or debate is referred to as the &quot;Main Bar.&quot; In other words, this is also known as the 'the other side of the story,&quot; which is important in Investigative Journalism, but at times, is useful on issues of public concern and discussion, like the ongoing debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, it was common knowledge that the major issue of discussion which unsurprisingly formed major headlines in the media, Legislature, street corners and at rendezvous was the request by President Sirleaf to the National Legislature, seeking extra power in the fight against the spread of the Ebola virus. However,since it was learned that the President had made such request, there have been strong opposition or rejection to her request. One of my lawmakers, Bhofal Chambers said even former dictator Adolf Hitler of Germany, could not have even made such a request.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I do not agree with the President's communication, I feel such a comparison, considering the distasteful activities of Hitler by my lawmaker, was inappropriate. Notwithstanding, I respect his rights to speak out his mind on this debate. However, that is not the issue for this piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is already known, the issues that the President is seeking approval under the State of Emergency are 1. Alteration of Election Time and Manner; 2. Labor; that is to procure certain labor or services during this State of Emergency; 3. Free Movement; 4.Religious restriction- to restrict certain religious practices generally or specifically, if she finds that such practice further endangers the public health and contribute to the spread of the virus. 5. Restriction on speech: 6. Assembly- to limit the right to assembly for any reason and 7. Appropriation of Property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since I joined the debate on the President's letters last week, I have written two articles, maintaining that such a request was not necessary. In the first article, specifically on restriction on speech, I said such a request on restriction on speech was not necessary considering the level of press freedom and likened such a request to &quot;wasting water on duck's back&quot; because at level at which free speech and freedom of the press have reached is irreversible and that any attempt to curtail this could be a fruitless exercise. I concluded that piece by saying that the President is creating unnecessary headache for herself or unwarranted public debate on this issue because the level of freedom this country has reached is so unprecedented and, as such, remains irreversible. Besides, the very constitution that also guarantees this State of Emergency, makes it succinctly clear that 'freedom of expression&quot; shall not be curtailed, even in an emergency, as stated in article 15(a), which states,&quot; Every person shall have the right to freedom of expression, being fully responsible for the abuse thereof. This right shall not be curtailed, restricted or enjoyed by government, save during an emergencydeclared in accordance with this Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second article published yesterday under the caption: MADAM PRESIDENT, I STILL BEG TO DIFFER, which grew out of a second communication on the same matter sent to the National Legislature to elucidate on her previous one, I again said this was not necessary. I pointed out that the State of Emergency granted by the Legislature in august this year, gives her the power to act prudently and sagaciously in taking measures on this war against the Ebola virus. I maintained, and still maintain that there is no constitutional provision, as it is being misconstrued, that mandates her to state the kind of rights to be restricted. I then concluded that the letters were not necessary, as she already has the power to act. It was based on this she even imposed the curfew and quarantined certain areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEBATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, as the debate continues, I wish to take it from another angle in the public space. There is no gainsaying that the President has been censured for seeking this extra power, one of the important &quot;SIDES&quot; of this debate is the issue of freedom of the press and freedom of speech. The other side of this debate on the president's request shows the level of freeness, as it relates to freedom of speech and freedom of the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatively speaking, the fact that people can publicly disagree with the President, sometimes derogatorily, without fear and apprehension, sends a positive signal that we, as a nation and people are enjoying these freedoms, which are very crucial in the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who has been in the media for over three decades, I can consciously say that had it been in the past, some people who had disagreed with the President might have gone into hiding, or some would have left the country to seek political asylum in other countries. Besides, had it been in the past, some dare to &quot;DISAGREE&quot; with the President. Sometimes it was even like a taboo to take issue with the &quot;Chief&quot; or to take the &quot;Chief&quot; to task whenever the &quot;Chief' said something, especially in this matter where the Chief is asking for extra powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I always said on such a matter, I do not support any disrespect to the Presidency, even if people would disagree with that office. I maintain that, that office, the highest in the land, should be treated with great reverence, even, in our disagreement on issues of national concern. But again, these are some of the &quot;bitter pills&quot; and tolerance we have to swallow or live with, as leaders to keep the freedoms on tract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must beware that although freedom is not absolute, for which the constitutional provision guarantee this freedom said those who abuse this could be held for any &quot;abuse thereof,&quot; we should always expect that some individual would, in the exercise of this freedom, say things that are not pleasant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To digress a bit, as I was concluding this piece, I received information that the Government of Liberia remains adamant to reinstating the two key officials of the Health Workers Association. I see this as an act of insensitivity at this time of national crisis, especially in the health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once more on the issue at bar, let me re-emphasize that the other side of this debate on the President's request to the National Legislature, is the freeness that characterized this ongoing debate. Hence, we must pat ourselves on the back, that we can disagree with the &quot;Chief&quot; and sometimes censure the &quot;Chief.&quot; This, I see as the other side of the ongoing debate, not necessarily the news angle. I Rest My Case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 3 hours presentation was interactive as the facilitators were able to speak and correct the doubts in the minds of participants of how the virus is spread and how it can be prevented and that coming down with Ebola is not a death sentence, but early seeking of treatment gives one the chance to survive. However, what kills most is denial!&quot;, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release further read that the training initiative was birth out of the spiritual intervention of the Church when the Banjor Community got highly hit by the Virus in August and September, prompting the Pastor of the New Water in the Desert Rev. Dr. Kortu K. Brown with an instruction from the Lord to organize the churches within the Banjor Community and launch a one week prayer intervention called the Jericho Praise in and around the entire Banjor Community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also said they were taught that the disinfectants measurement is of two types, highly concentrated, 0.5 solution for disinfecting areas and other things that may belong to sick person and the 0.05 solution for hand washing and were now fully equipped to take the massage to their community with most persisting emphasis against denial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberian inventor, Mr. Louis K. Tealeh, has produced an automatic Ebola Hand Washing Bucket which can be used only by stepping on the peddler.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introducing the bucket recently at the Ministry of Information's daily Ebola News Conference held at the Ministry of Information, Information Minister, Lewis G.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Brown promised to bring the inventor's work to the attention of the Management of the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company (LPRC) and others to assist in the production of more of the invented bucket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the news conference, Agriculture Minister, Florence Chenoweth said it is good that a bucket of such magnitude can be invented, saying, &quot;Since Ebola is spread by contact and touching, it is good that this bucket has been invented which only releases the chlorinated water only by stepping on the peddler and not touching the faucet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Chenoweth said it is good that the inventor be given special assistance to produce more of the automatic buckets which will go a long way in easing the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inventor, Mr. Louis Tealeh who is a graduating student of the master program at the University of Liberia has been engaged in the idea of invention for many years.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the strategy to interrupt the spread of Ebola in Liberia, the Ebola Incident Manager at the Ministry of Health Dr. Miatta Gbayan said more should be done beyond healthcare facilities to break the chain of transmission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The position of the Task Force is to invite the WASH sector to form an integral part in the fight against Ebola based on the significant role the sector plays in disease prevention and control. About one month ago, the sector announced the National WASH</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf says with improved knowledge and capacity occasioned by support from partners, Liberia is confident that the Ebola epidemic would soon be contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader was speaking Thursday, October 9, 2014 at the High-level Event on the Impact of Ebola Crisis. With this understanding and pledged capacity expansion, she said, the Liberian government was looking up to partnership support for its 3-point anti-Ebola and recovery strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, we must contain the disease in a more timely and decisive response,&quot; the president said. &quot;This means the construction of treatment and testing and burying centers with a time frame of one month - by mid-November all such facilities functioning with staffed health workers, both local and expatriate. We need more resources for establishment of community care centers with ownership and participation by communities themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf said counting on partnership support the government was considering improving and strengthening the regular health care system. This is, because according to her, many of the deaths recorded resulted from regular deaths of those who had no access to closed or non-functional health facilities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will also require support for compensation to health care workers who for fear of the risk involved have refused or are reluctant to return to work,&quot; she told delegates to the high-level event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final strategy for the anti-Ebola fight, the President said, as to support government's effort to reduce the hardship the epidemic has imposed upon the economy. She said the epidemic has caused the shifting of the nation's meager purse from financing ongoing operations under the administration's &quot;Agenda for Transformation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will require stimulation of our productive sectors, particularly agriculture. This will also require significant support to completion of ongoing infrastructure projects primarily power, roads, ports and water, which are vital to improved access to and quality of health care,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then assured the partners that her administration remained firm in its commitment and resolve to meet the challenges of the Ebola crisis. This, she said, it would do by ensuring a fully integrated coordination and decision-making structure around a unified strategy and implementation mechanism. She pledged transparency and accountability in the process and noted that she would safeguard these guarantors of fair play by ensuring the full participation of domestic and expatriate accounting and auditing companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader then thanked partnership representatives to the event &quot;for the tremendous support which Liberia received from your institutions as we travelled the road of economic and social recovery&quot;. Earlier in her remarks, President Sirleaf reminded the delegates that Liberia had, since 2003, sought to reactivate the productive sectors, repair destroyed infrastructure, rebuild dormant institutions, develop capacity, and promote democracy in an open society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Restoring bilateral and multilateral relationships and partnerships formed an important element of this policy of stabilization and reform,&quot; she said. She said those efforts, thought slow in producing results, paid off significantly in the areas of direct foreign investment, annual budget increase, construction of roads and bridges, schools and hospitals, electricity and water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the MDGs, we are set to achieve women empowerment. We reduced from as high at 65 percent to 28 percent the incidences of malaria and showed the greatest progress in reducing child mortality. The progress was not total for we experienced, in the last year, a decline in the growth rate exacerbated by budget deficit on account of global price decline in major exports and price increase in import of basic commodities,&quot; she disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, she said, the Ebola outbreak - which started in March and returned with intensity in June, spread into the capital city where one third of the population resides - interrupted the development gains. She said this happened primarily not for lack of trying but that the nation had limited understanding of the disease, which lack of understanding was exacerbated by low human capacity and a slow international response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result the disease spread to all of our political sub-divisions, over 2199 has died, including 92 health care workers, and a further 6689 of our citizens are being traced as contacts. Affecting our neighbors in Guinea and Sierra Leone, as well, restrictions imposed on air and sea travel resulted in increased cost of travel and increased commodity prices affecting the poor,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said a change for the better was in the horizon. &quot;With the support from development partners and the international community, we are working hard to contain the epidemic. We face huge challenges to ensure controlled treatment, robust contact tracing and vigorous case management to stop transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to do more to change habits and attitudes through advocacy and community mobilization. We need to make sure that bodies are promptly removed from the streets of our cities and homes of our families. More than ever we need qualified and dedicated staff to join the fight against Ebola and we need to ensure that it all comes together immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, with better knowledge and capacity, and robust support from partners, including the institutions you represent, we are a bit more confident that our collective response will turn the curve away from the dire projections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the cessation of conflict in 2003, Liberia has sought to reactivate the productive sectors, repair destroyed infrastructure, rebuild dormant institutions, develop capacity, and promote democracy in an open society. Restoring bilateral and multilateral relationships and partnerships formed an important element of this policy of stabilization and reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results were slower than we had expected, but the progress unmistakable -in growth direct foreign investment, annual budget increase, construction of roads and bridges, schools and hospitals, electricity and water. In the MDGs, we are set to achieve women empowerment. We reduced from as high at 65 percent to 28 percent the incidences of malaria and showed the greatest progress in reducing child mortality.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our development agenda was interrupted by the Ebola outbreak which started in March and returned with intensity in June spread into the capital city where one third of the population resides. With limited understanding of the disease, low human capacity and a slow international response - the disease quickly outpaced our ability to contain it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What can be done and what more do we ask of you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we must contain the disease in a more timely and decisive response.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, we need to improve and strengthen regular health care system because many of the deaths recorded resulted from regular deaths of those who had no access to closed or non-functional health facilities. This will also require support for compensation to health care workers who for fear of the risk involved have refused or are reluctant to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, we must mitigate the economic consequences of the Ebola crisis which have caused a shifting of resources from ongoing operations under our Agenda for Transformation. This will require stimulation of our productive sectors, particularly agriculture. This will also require significant support to completion of ongoing infrastructure projects primarily power, roads, ports and water which are vital to improved access to and quality of health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, I want you to know that our Government remains firm in its commitment and resolve to meet the challenges of this crisis by ensuring a fully integrated coordination and decision making structure around a unified strategy and implementation mechanism with full transparency and accountability involving both domestic and expatriate accounting and auditing institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thank each of you for the tremendous support which Liberia received from your institutions as we travelled the road of economic and social recovery. I thank you even more today as you join us in meeting the challenges of the Ebola crisis ensuring that our renewed health care system will prevent a recurrence and our economic gains are restored.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who think that the House of Representatives is a rubberstamp, subservient to the &quot;Presidential Throne&quot;, must by now be feeling gladly disappointed. In praise of members of House of Representatives, there have been fond appellations like 'the People's True Representatives' and 'Lawmakers of the people' coming out of the mouths and pens of several citizens some of whom had besmirched the lawmakers as being bunch of blackmailers, traitors, bribe takers and lazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this change of tongue is coming because the lawmakers have unanimously refused to grant President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf additional powers under the state of emergency imposed by Government professedly to fight Ebola in the country. There had been public uproar since President Sirleaf wrote the National Legislature requesting the exercise of powers that entails the temporary abrogation of constitutional rights of the people of the Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, as The Analyst's Sallu K. Swaray reports, the Upper Chamber of the Legislature, the Senate, is still undecided whether or not to grant President Sirleaf such powers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the media and experts continue to report that Government is losing the battle against the Ebola virus, resulting into increasing fatalities, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is seemingly stronger and winning the Constitutional debacle ignited in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was little resistance when the President imposed the rare constitutional declaration of state of emergency followed by dusk to dawn curfew and the quarantining of entire communities. Sweet in her mouth, as comical folks would put it, the President recently requested the Legislature to grant her additional powers that would provide carte blanche to freeze citizens' fundamental rights, including the rights to assembly, free speech, religion amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On hearing the president's request, the Liberian public went berserk in their reactions, calling on the Legislature to quash it, though there were many others who thought the Legislature, being historically subservient to the Executive Branch of Government, would not oppose the president's budding zest for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calculus changed on Friday when the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted against President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request expressed in a communication letter sent to that august body craving for indulgence of lawmakers to grant her additional presidential powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers &quot;threw out the President's letter over the Capitol Building's window&quot; as some tauntingly put it after the vote taken following a lengthy debate over the weekend. Forty-eight (48) lawmakers constituting two-thirds majority of the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly against Madam Sirleaf's letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a motion to the House Plenary, Grand Bassa County Representative J. Baron Brown said: &quot;Having carefully listened to the reading of a communication from the Chief Executive requesting this Honorable Body to approve measures in keeping with the need for emergency power granted her under Article 86 A&amp;B of the Liberian Constitution of 1986 to exercise powers over Article 1,2, Article 1,12,13 14,15,17 &amp; 24, I move, if I can receive a second, that considering the fact that Article 1 of the Liberian constitution is clear which states &quot;All Powers inherent in the People; all true governments are instituted by their authority, and for their benefits; and they have their rights to alter and refer the same with their safety and happiness so required,&quot; that the request of President Sirleaf be thrown out of the window of Capitol Building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep Brown said he was making the motion in order to ensure democratic government which represents a response to the wishes of the governed, the people, shall have the rights as such period and in such manner as provided for under this Constitution, to call their public servant to leave office and to fill vacant seat by regular elections and appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Brown indicated that in line with this rule, or with this provision of the constitution of Liberia, and realizing the fact that the communication of her Excellency President Sirleaf requesting for additional power under the state of emergency was not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, I move that if I receive a second, that the communication read from the Executive be rejected and given no consideration because it is not necessary at this time,&quot; he Rep Brown moved. He added that the Constitution in Article 1 exclusively gives &quot;us the power as the people's representatives to we adopt a resolution that should be signed and send over to the Liberian Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In modifying Rep. Brown's motion, Lofa County Representative Eugene Fallah Kparkar added that in order for him to vote on the weight of Brown's motion, and since the President Sirleaf was seeking absolute power, a Resolution of the kind being suggested by Rep Brown, it was expedient that the Rules of this House be suspended so that when there was any motion for reconsideration it should be tested immediately and disposed of once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Montserrado County District #8 Representatives Acarious Moses Gray intervened by reminding his colleagues about Article 88 of the Constitution which stated that when a state of emergency is declared, it is only the Legislature should have the authority to revoke or to modify any measures that should be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Gray said it has also been clear that the president has no authority to make a request of the magnitude, adding: &quot;We must make a determination, and the President must carry on that determination in the two last chapters of Article 88.&quot; everal other lawmakers, including Maryland County Representatives Bhofal Chambers, repeated their readiness to vote based on the amendments made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bong County Representatives, George Mulbah said, &quot;I will be ready to vote if colleagues accept this amendment, that immediately after the report, this Plenary shall communicate with the president and the Liberian Senate that the letter for more power by the President has been rejected, and also place the president on notice that this communication also constitutes a constitutional breach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be pleased if you were to take this amendment into account and to inform the President that additional power will only come at the end of her report [to the Legislature on progress made under the state of emergency] in November 6, 2014 when the state of emergency shall have elapsed,&quot; said Bomi County Representatives Gayah Karmo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the modified motion was placed on the floor, it was carried nearly unanimously and the House Plenary through House Speaker Alex Tyler mandated the Chief Clerk of the House, Mildred Sayon, to take note and act accordingly and make communication to Madam President of the decision to reject her request to grant her additional power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Clerk was mandate to include in the communication to the President that the 90-day duration of the state of emergency has not ended and it was unnecessary for her to be asking for more power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Liberian Senate is still embroiled in endless debate as to what to do: whether to grant the presidency the requested excessive powers or not. According to a news release members of the House of Senate are split over a communication from President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf seeking the body's endorsement for additional powers to fight the Ebola virus in keeping with the current State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate had set Thursday, October 9, to discuss the letter President Sirleaf sent on October 1, when a second communication from the President dated October 8 outlining reasons for wanting extra emergency powers, was also received by the upper House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the two communications were read in plenary by the Secretary of the Senate on Thursday, several senators decided that the President's request be rejected, while others appealed for consideration of the document. Senators Isaac Nyenabo of Grand Gedeh, Frederick Cherue of River Gee, John Ballout of Maryland and Sumo Kupee of Lofa counties, were among the lawmakers who opined that the President's request be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them, their plea was based on the August 8 Joint Resolution adopted by the Senate and House of Representatives, which acknowledges the outbreak of Ebola and its spread as a clear danger to the state and its people. They said under the circumstances the president should be granted extraordinary powers within existing agreements to provide other measures for the containment of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stressed that in the President's formal request for the first emergency powers, she stated that the list of all the emergency powers required to contain the further spread of the virus was not yet exhausted, and would have informed the body of additional measures when necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senators further argued that added powers to the existing ones pose no danger to the citizenry, as the present emergency in the country demands tough measures, adding, &quot;There is no danger, manipulation, plot or conspiracy in the president's decision to deal with difficult times as this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Senators Alphonso Gaye of Grand Gedeh, Peter Coleman of Grand Kru, Geraldine Doe Sheriff of Montserrado, George Tengbeh of Lofa, Sando Johnson and Lahai Lassanah of Bomi, Nyonblee Karngar Lawrence of Grand Bassa, Dallas Gueh and J. Jonathan Barney of River Cess, Jewel Howard Taylor of Bong, Mobutu Vlah Nyenpahn of Sinoe counties, among other senators, argued that there was no need for such power to be granted the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them the main topic that needs redress apart from current Ebola crisis is Article 83, and not Articles 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 24. They said while they appreciate the spirit of coordination in government, any attempt by them to alter any portion of the Constitution as requested by President Sirleaf, especially Article 1, will pose danger to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 1 of the Liberian Constitution states that all power is inherent in the people who have the power to alter the manner, &quot;one man, one vote, secret ballot&quot; through the process of referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them, Articles 13, 14 and 15 which deal with religion, free movement and freedom of speech, were part of the August 8 resolution, and need no further stringent measures, while 12, 17 and 24, dealing with labor, assembling, and private property, are delicate matters that form part of the judicial jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several hours of debate on the floor, the body could not come up with a concrete decision, as they were seen in groups chatting about the way forward, until a motion for adjournment was made at 7:45p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that President Johnson Sirleaf wrote the Legislature on October 1, followed by a clarification letter on October 8, in quest of more emergency powers to sustain the State of emergency, with Articles 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 24 being areas to effect some changes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Liberia's intermittent years of civil war, where Liberians under the canopy of warring factions slaughtered each other and destroyed basic infrastructural facilities with the pretext of fighting for liberation and emancipation; conversely, the outbreak of the world's deadliest Ebola virus disease has drifted in another direction armed with its invisible arsenals creating calamities in most communities across the country. The virus only seen through aid of high-tech laboratory device has torn an already shaky health system to be overwhelmed and overstressed in tackling the increased number of cases. Indeed, from all indications, it has spun out of control to become an uncompromising medical crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This crisis is unprecedented. This time, it is no longer the sounds of missile, rocket-propelled grenade, mortar and other artillery. Even though, sporadic gunfire from armed robbers coupled with the recent broad daylight shooting of a-16-year-old unarmed Liberian by soldiers of the newly trained Armed Forces of Liberia in Monrovia's largest shantytown of West Point further delineates that role to consolidating Liberia's fragile peace is far from reach and severe throes continue without justice for the underprivileged and marginalized citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no longer a fight between and among dissident forces, warring factions and government troops battling for territories or conscripting peaceful civilians or committing countless atrocities. It is no longer the inability of wounded rebels to acquire medical treatment. It is simply no longer a war to be won on the battlefield or through negotiation with rivals or power sharing struggle among warlords or individuals who are thirsty for political leadership in any place within or outside Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ranked as one of the world's poorest countries that have tasted the bitter swill of civil conflict, which ruined every sector of the country, depleted the human resource capacity, and brought untold and inhumane suffering; Liberia is battling for the first-time in human history an enemy not visible to the nicked eyes. The aftermath of the 14-year strife resulted in a broken public health, dreadful healthcare delivery system, and dilapidated medical infrastructures. Consequently, limited number of health practitioners, inadequate information on diseases, and lack of medical training, insufficient logistics and basic social services together with structural and governance problems are further exacerbating the Ebola virus disease morbidity and mortality rates. As a matter of fact, before the outbreak, Liberia had one doctor to treat every 100,000 patients in a total population of over 3.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the persistent lack of public trust among many ordinary Liberians as a result of rampant corruption in the public sector and years of foreign exploitation have heightened mistrust and panic that could hinder the fight to kick the deadly Ebola virus disease out of Liberia. Take for instance, from the onset of the outbreak in Lofa County, scores of Liberians propagated that the disease was a concocted attempt to amass wealth at the decrement of the already poverty-stricken population. Others held to the notion that foreign doctors as well as institutions were spreading the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, entrenched traditional and cultural practices coupled with limited information and resources give rise to the disease becoming widespread and bustling around and distinct from any previously known infections that occurred in remote places and tropical rainforest. The virus is travelling easily across borders through plane, car and migration on foot. Like in the case of Eric Duncan, a Liberian who travelled to the United States of America and was tested positive for the virus and later died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are still hiding their loved ones who have shown some early symptoms of Ebola, while a handful of people who voluntarily turn themselves to the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) are rejected due to insufficient bed capacity to handle patients. Besides, sometime an ambulance is called to pick up a patient who has shown some early symptoms of Ebola and in some cases the ambulance will take a day or two to response. There are some cases, where the ambulance returns the patient to their resident on ground that there isn't enough beds to admit the patient. Notwithstanding, when that patient dies, the ambulance alongside the burial team dressed in their personal protective equipment would return ready to take the body to be cremated as witnessed with several cases in Soul Clinic community and perhaps other parts of the country. Accordingly, some patients have to wait outside for days before being admitted into the ETU. However, there are some patients in the ETU who still complained of daily meals and other essential needs. All the more so, in some ETUs, patients who are found to be suspected, probable and confirmed of the virus are kept together like the case of Island Clinic on the Bushrod Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still limited number of testing centers which is mostly located in Monrovia and other ideal urban areas. Most people died without being tested, but their corpses are taken for cremation. Due to the limited number of testing centers, many Liberians have died under the sentinel of health workers who demand Ebola test clearance before rendering treatment; most notably, the daughter of Representative Edward Forh of District #16 Montserrado County. Many children who lost their parents and entire family from Ebola have turned to be orphans without any hope for a better future. Up till now, Liberia is barely doing any contact-tracing, quarantining communities for the required period of time, and monitoring everyone who has come into contact with person suspected of the Ebola. To cap it all, those who survived Ebola are often shunned by their families, friends and neighbors. This leaves a long-lasting psychosocial impact on Ebola survivors due to disinformation and misconception on the part of the general public and ill-intentioned individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers across the sweet land of liberty have taken a sacred oath to save lives. Since the outbreak of Ebola, many health workers have lost their lives from the disease which took them by extreme surprise. Most of them have never experienced the Ebola virus disease before and didn't know what sort of diagnostic measures or medication or treatment to employ. Already prone to touching patients without protective gears like gloves which is too often in short supply at many health centers coupled with inadequate sources of energy and lack of running water and poor washing hands practices led to increase number of death among health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health workers who at the front line to combating Ebola are afraid because they have seen their colleagues died from the disease without any appropriate benefit to commensurate with qualification and competence. Many health workers who are making the ultimate sacrifice have fallen ill from the disease while several health workers who are in the vanguard to providing basic health services still complained of inadequate supply of personal protective equipment and just compensation as promised by the government. In fact, some health workers have threatened to take protest action if nothing is done to address compensation and other accompanying benefits. Furthermore, health workers who are at the forefront of eradicating the virus are often being stigmatized in their communities. Some family members have even gone to the extent of ostracizing health workers who worked directly with the Ebola Treatment Unit or assigned with other Ebola related activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let face it, in a crisis situation like Liberia is experiencing, one cannot go to the battlefield unprepared or traumatized. Every health worker involves in the battle to eliminate Ebola has got to be treated with dignity and respect and given reasonable compensation that could serve as catalyst to stimulate them to be more robust in eradicating this invisible enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of taking a sacred oath, health workers are human beings like everyone and deserve to be treated fairly. They too have family and need to take care of them. They too need food, shelter, clothing and other basic necessities that life has got to offer. And, they too deserve all of the fundamental human rights, most especially the right to life just like anyone in other professions. For this reason, health workers within the public and private sectors have got to be accorded the rights and privileges to pursue their full professional path without continuous intimidation, unceasing dismissal and unremitting threats emanating from supervisors, health authority, members of the ruling establishment and well-connected individuals. The time has come to surely change the scope of operations to a new paradigm of dignity and respect for all health workers irrespective of creed, background, political affiliation, country of origin or last name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people are of the strongest conviction that from the very beginning of the outbreak, the Liberian government demonstrated a lackadaisical approach towards ensuring zero infection. The Ministry of Health &amp; Social Welfare disseminated conflicting information and poor public education about the disease that resulted to fear and confusion among Liberians and foreigners residing in the territorial boundary of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the virus shifted from rural areas to the political capital and began infecting many people, the government played lip service in declaring a state of emergency which suspended constitutional rights for a 90-day period, imposing a national curfew, closing border, shutting down schools for time indefinite, restricting movement of people through mass quarantines, giving leave to nonessential employees and deploying the Armed Forces of Liberia in the outbreak's hot spots just for a few days without testing equipment or appropriate screening measures. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that these actions on the part of the government have not yielded fruitful results and perhaps it has caused more harm than good due to the manner and form in which these measures have been undertaken as evidenced in the number of confirmed cases and increased death toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government chose to centralize the entire Ebola fight primarily in Montserrado County, instead of initially acclimatizing a community based approach in disseminating public health information about the killer disease and training community to get involved in rigorous contact tracing. There is only one call center, which does not have the capacity to even response to calls within Monrovia let alone the entire country. Most of the donated ambulances and other vehicles are still visible in Monrovia while rural communities are in desperate need. There are pseudo anti-Ebola structures in the counties, because all decisions are reached in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To further crippled an already ineffective measures purported by the government, some concessionaires have scale down operations and employees while some skilled employees are fleeing in great numbers. Some local businesses have already lain off employees while private school teachers who are mostly contractors have not taken pay for months. Cross-border trade remains halted and numerous airlines have canceled regular flights while some developed countries are putting in place vigorous screening procedures for passengers traveling from Ebola-stricken countries. Prices of local commodities are gradually skyrocketing daily while spending power has tremendously decreased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that Liberians from all walks of life alongside foreign counterparts are fearlessly, selflessly and tirelessly working around the clock to make Ebola a history just as it was in the case of the civil crisis. The fight against Ebola cannot be won only by frequent meetings in conference rooms with limited results or daily press conference just for the sake of mere talk when such information is not getting across to a greater portion of the population or nonstop talk shows that are far-fetched or public health education with distorted messages about the Ebola virus disease. Kicking Ebola out of Liberia and preventing its reoccurrence have got to take a realistic, patriotic and holistic approach involving everyone. It must take the collective efforts of every individual, institution, government as well as developmental partners and friendly nations working together to tackle the disease rather than isolating Ebola hard-hit countries or screening or rejecting people from the affected region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In as much as friendly nations like the United States of America, China, Japan, Nigeria and many others nations including international organizations are contributing immensely to curb the widespread of Ebola; the government of Liberia needs to decisively act in the best interest of its people. The government must begin to settle arrears of health workers in order to avoid the planned strike action which will be devastating for an already dreadful healthcare delivery system and as well concentrate on dialoguing with health workers so as to find amicable solution to this long-standing issue of salary and accompanying benefits for the dedicated men and women who have taken a sacred oath to save lives. The government must begin to keep its promises and cultivate more transparent and accountable measures in an endeavor to build public trust. The government must ensure all hospitals, major health centers and every port of entry has access to Ebola testing equipment as well as allocates more resources for public health initiatives and invests more in epidemiological research. In addition, the government must work with all stakeholders in the formation of every anti-Ebola policy, procedure and measure so that people can have their say and get involved in eradicating the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the government is doing her part, citizens too must take action. Citizens cannot wait for the government to do everything; they must play their part responsibly. People have got to adhere to all Ebola preventive measures as prescribed by the Government of Liberia including the World Health Organization and the U.S. based Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Every community across this country should voluntarily engage in anti-Ebola outreach initiatives, most especially in hard-to-reach places. Community must be active participants in ensuring zero infection by getting involved in contact tracing and reporting suspected patients to the health centers. Everyone must make it their business to unshackle the minds of people who are still in the state of denial. Liberians need to put an end to the misconceptions and myths about the disease. The time for destroying, stealing and looting anti-Ebola materials is over and everyone who are in the limelight of managing Ebola funds and materials must be made to account for every penny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together Liberians must dust themselves off of petty politics and recrimination that have held this country backward for far too long and begin to join forces to defeat the common enemy that has invaded this country and indiscriminately killing people. For this moment onward, let every Liberian muster the challenge to see Ebola as an opportunity to strengthen the health system, stimulate the economy, build a vibrant response mechanism, foster epidemiological research, cultivate in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, restore public trust and nurture good citizenship. No matter what happens or how long it takes, through the eyes of faith, let every Liberian wakeup, shakeup and standup to stamp out Ebola through a united front.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts' reports on the prevailing state of affairs continue to consistently indicate that the Ebola Virus Disease is outpacing national and international response efforts so far deployed to reverse the tide and restore the country back to normal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is clearly a grim condition that unarguably makes Liberia, once again, a no-go area, particularly since the latest enemy, unlike the days of the civil conflict, invisible and incurable. In fact, nationals who had left their national comforts to come to this &quot;hot zone&quot; to help the situation unfortunately turned out to be victims themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unarguably horrifying situation is by no means perturbing the pouring into the country of international compassion and goodwill which has reached avalanching proportion. This includes top notch international guests braving the hot zone. The Government has reported the arrival of yet another high power delegation in the country to access firsthand how things are faring and what's urgently needed to be done. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been announced by the Ministry of Information that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will today meet with the Foreign Minister of Norway, Borge Brende and the Administration of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Rajiv Shah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit comes in the wake of increasing international attention and support to Liberia in the fight against Ebola. The release noted that Administrator Shah is visiting to review progress of the overall response to the outbreak, especially the American involvement in the response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is his first visit to Liberia since President Obama announced that up to 3000 US troops would be committed to combat the Ebola outbreak. Foreign Minister Brende, for his part, will get a firsthand look and briefing on the outbreak and its effect on the country. He is expected to renew Norway's commitment to assisting Liberia with Ebola, and the Scandinavian country's partnership beyond Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Brende who is also Councilor of State presides over the Ministry is responsible for foreign trade and cooperation with international organizations. He is a member of the Conservative Party and previously served in the Norwegian government as Minister of the Environment and as Minister of Trade and Industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a MICAT release, Administrator Rajiv Shah began leadership of USAID a few days before the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010. He is generally credited for leading a very successful effort in assisting Haiti recover through a very swift and effective response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that Administrator Shah will bring the same vision and strategic response to the fight against Ebola. Rajiv Shah previously served as the Under Secretary of Research, Education and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Information Minister Lewis G. Brown, Government intends to engage the two important international guests on increasing support to communities in the fight against Ebola which will increase ownership of the fight against Ebola through county care centers amongst other measures. The Government also intends to seek support for ongoing efforts to rebuild the public health system of the country, Minister Brown said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bong County Health Team has reported 73 new cases of Ebola for the period of one week. According to the administrator of the County Health Team Fartormah Jusu, out of the number, nine were confirmed and forty- nine suspected and probable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jusu also announced that the Bong County Ebola task force received seventy specimen results of which 32 were positive and 36 negative, while two are in-determinant. He also disclosed that a cumulative number of 972 contacts listed were recorded. He said out of the number 155 persons completed the 21-day quarantine. He named Gbarpolu County as the latest epic center of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosure was made Monday during a regular weekly briefing by the County Health Team. The latest increase in the number of suspected Ebola cases in Bong County comes amid an ongoing back off by Health Workers around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development The Chief Medical officer of the Phebe Hospital says the ongoing go-slow action of health workers is a major setback to the hospital. The National Liberian Health Association on October 13, 2014 began an indefinite go-slow action to claim government's attention to their plights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses are among other things calling for the re-instatement of the Association's President and secretary general, the implementation of the Senator Armah Jallah committee report and risk benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in an interview with the Analyst Dr. Jefferson Sabley said the action by the nurses is not timely considering the constraints the health sector is facing as the result of the Ebola outbreak. The Phebe Hospital chief medical officer believes Liberia has come a long way in the fight against the epidemic and current strike by nurses could undermine the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sabley wants the Nurses return to work and continued to engage the government in meeting their demands. Dr. Sabley said there are over fifty patients who are currently but some were leaving because of the Nurses strike. The Phebe Hospital chief medical officer, however said payment of risk benefit for nurses and other employees who work for the month of September is ongoing at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Sabley explained that the money was provided by Act Alliance, a Non Governmental Organization through the Lutheran Church in Liberia during the dedication of the isolation center at the hospital in late September this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral district two Representative Prince Moye is appealing to health Liberian workers to disengage their go-slow action. The National health Workers Association Monday October13began another go-slow after two strike action late last year and early 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bong County Lawmaker said the United States government has committed itself to assist in strengthening the health sector, which includes training for health workers and the provision of attractive incentives for them. Representative Moye said as part of the commitment, the U.S. government will also construct and equip hospitals in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Moye said as co-chair on the budget committee at the House of Representatives, he and other lawmakers are working with the executive to ensure the plights of health workers are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said abandonment of hospitals by health undermine the ongoing efforts to eradicate the Ebola disease and send a bad signal for Liberia. The Bong County Electoral District #2 Representative spoke to our Bong County Correspondent on Friday in Gbarnga.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">4928 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When news broke that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wrote the National Legislature requesting the actualization of the state of emergency declared in August by freezing a number of fundamental rights of the people of Liberia, myriad rights activists and a substantial segment of the population reacted tumultuously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact the national human rights think tank, Justice &amp; Public Interest Consortium Africa (JUPICA) announced it had tendered a writ of prohibition with the Supreme Court to inhibit the exercise of additional emergency powers by President Sirleaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUPICA indicated its writ was intended, amongst other things, to stop the President from suspending Constitutional fundamental rights of the people of Liberia, including the people's right to free speech, free movement and the right to own property and be protected against forced labor among others. It is not clear how far JUPICA and others have gone with their legal battle against the request for more emergency powers. What is known is that the House of Representatives has passed a resolution to reject the President's request.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before the likes of JUPICA and those sharing its moves ever had the change, or the right, to test the legal merits of the President's request, the head of the Supreme Court, the final arbiter of justice in the country, has begun exalting and justifying the extreme exercise of powers under a state of emergency, stating that such right and prerogative of the President is constitutionally sanctioned and Liberians should prepare themselves for it. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The date was yesterday, October 13. And the occasion was not the delivery of opinions of the Supreme Court. It was rather the formal opening of the October 2014 Term of Court. But perhaps it was an ideal forum for the man who is the final sealer of justice in the country to let the cat out of the bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must note, however, that during a state of emergency, the Constitution authorizes the President to exercise a range of powers and to curtail certain rights otherwise available to citizens and residents of this nation during normal times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal and non-legal arguers have been embroiled in near-endless debates since October 1, 2014, when President Sirleaf requested the National Legislature to approval the enforcement of the state of emergency--the actual curtailment of fundamental rights the 1986 Constitution grants the people of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In declaring the state of emergency in August this year, the President notified the Legislature that during the emergency period, she would inhibit the exercise of &quot;certain rights&quot; that were not specified. Two months later, the President has now got ready to inhibit those rights for which she was not requesting, some pundits say &quot;notifying&quot;, the Legislature about her readiness to exercise her right under the state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the House of Representatives rejected the President's &quot;request&quot; or &quot;notice&quot;, a civil society organization, Justice&amp; Public Interest Consortium Africa (JUPICA), reportedly filed a writ of prohibition with the Supreme Court asking for judicial review of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the petition invoking the Supreme Court's intervention, JUPICA for instance stated that its legal action was necessary to prohibit, restrain and prevent the reintroduction of &quot;force labor&quot;, something it said was clearly shown by the President Sirleaf's &quot;indefinite and ambiguous request to suspend Article 12 of the 1986 Constitution for the use of the labor and services of citizens without any provision thereto for just compensation for the use of such services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also indicated its petition to the High Court was imperative as a matter of right because President Sirleaf's &quot;undefined request for the suspension of freedoms of movement assembly and association for which the 2nd Respondent is preparing a debate of sheer words with little or no concrete action, will no doubt be a complete return to anarchy, dictatorship and authoritarian rule and this will amount to a constitutional alteration or a repeal of Article 13, which can only be achieved through a national referendum, and therefore, by entertaining a forum for such purpose grossly violates the constitutional rights of petitioner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The merits and demerits of JUPICA's arguments hovering over the national intellectual and legal space, the head of the Supreme Court says he is urging &quot;all citizens and foreign nationals residing in our country to be cognizant of the limitations on the exercise of certain constitutional and statutory rights during this period of the state of emergency. They must remain cautious, alert and obey all measures declared and enunciated to fight the Ebola virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court Chief Justice Francis S. Kporkpor said while the Liberian Constitution provides for a government with three co-equal branches, each with separate powers and functions, it is absolutely essential that these branches &quot;coordinate&quot; and cooperate with one another during this critical period of our nation to achieve the common goal of eradicating the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During a state of emergency,&quot; the Chief Justice said, &quot;the Constitution authorizes the President to exercise a range of powers and to curtail certain rights otherwise available to citizens and residents of this nation during normal times,&quot; calling for the cooperation of the three branches of the Government which he however said does not mean that any one branch will relinquish any of its powers to one or the other two branches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a people are faced with such imminent threat, the thing to do is to unite and fight back with every strength to defeat the common enemy, the Chief Justice said, adding: &quot;All other things, at such time, must give way or be subordinated to the threat. The alternative is for us to do nothing and perish. This we cannot and will not do. It therefore behooves us as a people and a nation to rise, to the occasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The virus knows no bounds; it does not distinguish between religion, tribe, political party, rich or poor, man or woman or black and white,&quot; Justice Kpokpor stressed. &quot;We must realize that as individual members of the Liberian society, we depend on the collective efforts and will of the greater society for our protection, security and wellbeing. This is because our collective will and strength enable us to react to situations that are likely to endanger or destroy our existence as a nation and people. We must therefore cooperate with each other and with constituted authorities in this critical time for the good of our nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, &quot;under Liberian law, the Republic of Liberia, as a party litigant, has no special rights and enjoys no special privileges that are not available to ordinary persons the Republic may bring to court or vice-versa&quot; but that the Republic of Liberia is subject to all applicable procedural rules of court as well as applicable substantive laws and shall be treated as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only exception to this general rule is in cases where the application of the general rule would compromise national security or a vital national interest,&quot; he said further. &quot;We therefore want to assure all citizens and residents of this nation that during this period of state of emergency, the Judiciary will not relent in its constitutional mandates; it will continue to perform its role as the anchor of our Government to which our people look for redress of their grievances and the guarantor of their freedoms and liberties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice however noted that all this does not mean that the Judiciary will not perform its traditional role as a disinterested and impartial arbiter of disputes, whether such disputes are between the other two branches of the Government, or between one or two of them and one or more private citizens, or between two or more private citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it means is that each branch must work in harmony with tie other branches, just as ordinary citizens of this country with different backgrounds and persuasions are required to work together to eradicate the virus,&quot; he clarified. &quot;After all, there can be no Legislative, no Executive or Judiciary Branch of Government if the virus overwhelms us. We must first act to survive as a people, government and country before we can even talk o the separateness of our branches of government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised that the Judiciary will collaborate with the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government in every lawful venture and initiative in fighting the virus. As a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fight the Ebola virus, the Chief Justice further noted, &quot;my Colleagues and I have resolved to contribute and are prepared to one month of our salaries and allowances spread over a period of four months and deducted from our income at a rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He encouraged the members of the Legislative Branch of Government, all Liberian citizens, those working in government and public as well as private corporations, and those who are self-employed (with the exception of doctors, nurses, and other health workers who are our front-line soldiers in the fight against Ebola) to consider making similar contributions to save our people and our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we see it, this contribution is necessary not only to demonstrate our concern and commitment to eradicate the virus from our country, but it will also convey the message of our ownership of the drive to combat and eliminate the virus&quot;. Justice Kporkpor said. &quot;And this will even embolden the resolve of the many friendly nations and international organizations that are providing material and human assistance to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also welcome from abroad, Madam Justice Jamesetta Howard Wolokolie from a well-deserved vacation after having served for more than six months in the Chambers of this Court. We expect that Madam Justice Sie-A-Nyene Yuoh will be with us by the coming week when we begin to hear and determine cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We regret to inform you of the death of CounsellorJ.D. Baryogar Junius, former Associate Justice of this Court. He died on July 3, 2014, at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital where he was taken upon falling ill. Counsellor Junius served the Judiciary, as well as the other branches of the Government of the Republic of Liberia in many high ranking positions: Associate Justice, Supreme Court of Liberia, Senator, Grand Bassa County, Resident Circuit Judge, Grand Bassa County, Solicitor General, Ministry of Justice, Assistant Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Coordinator of the Public Defense Program within the Judiciary, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also lost other dedicated Liberians who served in the Judiciary. In order of ranks, they are:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although not a member of the Judiciary, I like to mention the passing of my mother, Madam Kou Suah Korkpor. She died on September 3, 2014 at the age of 91 at the United Methodist Hospital in Ganta, Nimba County. We pray that God will forgive these fallen Liberians of their sins and grant them eternal rest. Amen!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Pro Tempore, My Colleagues, Members of the Bar, Ladies and Gentlemen, the practice is that at the time of the opening of each term of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice uses the occasion to inform the other Branches of the Government and the entire nation on the general state of affairs in the Judiciary during the immediate past term and gives a projection of what is expected for the current term. Or the Chief Justice may talk on matters relating to the administration of justice and rule of law within the courts and the development of our jurisprudence. I will depart from this tradition a little bit today and talk briefly on: the need for a collective effort to eradicate the Ebola virus from our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no disagreement that the virus is the outmost concern, or should I say worry, of all Liberians today. It is ravaging our country in no small measures with serious impact on our economy. It is changing our way of life. Whatever gains made in the Judiciary and in the entire country will be marred and rendered meaningless as long as the menace is still with us. Many citizens and foreign nationals have lost their lives to the dreadful disease, and as I speak, there is no indication that it has been fully contained in Liberia. Rather, report is that it is still spreading faster and exponentially. What started in one county in February this year has now reached all fifteen counties in our country. Current statistics show that a total of four thousand (4,000) people have died from Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, the four countries in West Africa where the outbreak has been reported, and that Liberia accounts for more than half of the deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore and according to experts, unless drastic measures are taken, as many as one million four hundred thousand (1,400,000) people in Liberia and Sierra Leone are likely to be infected with the virus by the end of January, 2015. These are very grim and alarming statistics. Indeed, at this pace, the virus is posing a clear and present danger to our survival as a people and existence as a nation. When a people are faced with such imminent threat, the thing to do is to unite and fight back with every strength to defeat the common enemy. All other things, at such time, must give way or be subordinated to the threat. The alternative is for us to do nothing and perish. This we cannot and will not do. It therefore behooves us as a people and a nation to rise to the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of Liberia is primarily in the hands of us Liberians. What we do or fail to do will determine our destiny. We must work together when the interest of our country is at stake. We must put aside our differences and appreciate our diversity as our strength rather than as our weakness. A diverse nation draws from its strength rather than its weakness. The virus knows no bounds; it does not distinguish between religion, tribe, political party, rich or poor, man or woman or black and white. We must realize that as individual members of the Liberian society, we depend on the collective efforts and will of the greater society for our protection, security and wellbeing. This is because our collective will and strength enable us to react to situations that are likely to endanger or destroy our existence as a nation and people. We must therefore cooperate with each other and with constituted authorities in this critical time for the good of our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We appreciate and are grateful to the international community for the numerous outpours of material and financial assistance to fight the virus. We thank the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Food Program, the European Union, the African Union and sister states of Africa, Samaritan Purse, MedecinSans Frontiere, the Government and People of China, Japan ,the Federal Republic of Germany, Cuba and all that are helping us. We particularly thank the Government of the United States of America, who, in addition to financial and material assistance, has sent a large number of military personnel here to help us construct facilities for treating those infected or suspected of being infected with the virus. I submit, however, that friendly countries and international organizations may help with resources and technical expertise, but the battle to rid Liberia of Ebola is primarily for us Liberians. No one can do for us what we are required to do for ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Judiciary took an early lead in putting in place precautionary measures against the virus. We invited experts from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare who talked to Justices, Judges and the workforce. We fumigated the entire Temple of Justice, including the surrounding courts. And we have continued to institute all measures recommended by medical and health authorities for the prevention of the disease which include: washing hands with water and recommended decontaminants and using thermometer to check the temperature of personnel of the Judiciary and visitors entering our premises, etc. We are informed that the virus is transmitted through person to person contacts when the saliva, sweat, blood, semen etc. from an infected person come into contact with a nun infected person. Therefore, we are advised to modify our behavior and refrain from engaging in orthodox traditional and cultural practices, especially as relates to funerals, burials, feasting public gathering in large numbers, hugging, kissing and handshaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have had several meetings with the trial judges, especially Magistrates and Associate Magistrates and advised them to exercise available discretionary powers under sections 10.12 and 13.5 of the Criminal Procedure Law which provide options to arrest and detention. The judges were warned that even in the event where it is mandatory that a defendant be committed to jail, such as in a matter involving a non-bailable offense, under no circumstance should a person infected or suspected of being infected with the Ebola virus be incarcerated. Instead, arrangement should be made with the involvement of the Ministry of Justice, to refer such a person to the health authorities for testing and/ or treatment. The objective is to control the number of persons in prisons/jails throughout the country and guide against over crowdedness and prevent the outbreak of the virus in our jails and prisons. Judges were further advised to exercise caution and avoid eviction arising from ejectment and summary proceedings to recover possession of real property during this difficult period when there are restrictions on the movement of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, we had a meeting with the leadership of the Liberian National Bar Association where we agreed that during this period, bench trial, rather than jury trial, should be encouraged. This is intended to avoid sequestrating and congregating jurors in one location thereby preventing physical contact which is a sure means of transmitting the virus. Overall, we are pleased with the responses and involvements of the judges and the members of the bar regarding the fight against the Ebola scourge. We recognize and commend the effort of the Association of Trial Judges who purchased and distributed anti-Ebola materials to courts in and around Monrovia as well as other parts of the country. We also recognize and commend the Liberian National Bar Association for its effort in setting up a Media Committee that is sensitizing people about the dangers of the virus. It would be good if the next quarterly assembly of the Bar could be exclusively devoted to further inform the public about the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Pro Tempore, My Colleagues, Members of the Bar, Ladies and Gentlemen, I recall that the Ebola virus epidemic is the fourth time in our modern history this nation has been subjected to a serious trial. The other previous trials occurred during the Rice Riots of April 14, 1979; the Military coup d'&eacute;tat of April 12, 1980; and the Civil War which commenced on December 24, 1989, and lasted for nearly fourteen years. Through our collective resolve and resiliency, we were able to overcome the effects of the Rice Riots and the effects of the Military coup; and we were well on our way to overcoming the consequences of the Civil War when we were struck by the present calamity. I believe that just as we did in the past, we can, as a nation acting in union strong, succeed in this fight against the Ebola virus and stop its calamitous effect on our nation. Fortunately, history tells us that this virus, wherever it has shown its ugly face, has been contained. When announcing his Government's plan to help us fight the Ebola virus, this is what President Barack Obama said: &quot;... Every outbreak of Ebola over the past40 years has been contained, and we are confident that this one can, and will be as well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To &quot;contain the spread and bring an end to the Ebola Virus,&quot; the President of Liberia, pursuant to the powers vested in her by the Constitution, declared a state of emergency on August 6, 2014.Under a state of emergency, certain constitutional as well statutory rights may be suspended. The declaration is required to outline the specific rights that are or to be affected. However, the Constitution recognizes that during a state of emergency like what now obtains in our country, our courts shall remain functional in order to guide against any excesses by the Legislative or Executive Branches of the Government. The Judiciary remains seized with the duty and is authorized even in the environment of the state of emergency to determine the obligations, responsibilities and liabilities of the Government to the citizenry in appropriate justiciable cases brought before the courts by citizens or group of citizens alleging violation of their constitutional rights not suspended under or otherwise affected by the declaration of the state of emergency. Article 26 of the Constitution provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where any person or any association alleges that any of the rights granted under this Constitution or any legislation or directives are constitutionally contravened, that person or association may invoke the privilege and benefit of court direction, order or writ, including a judgment of unconstitutionality; and anyone injured by an act of the Government or any person acting under its authority, whether in property, contract, tort or otherwise, shall have the right to bring suit for appropriate redress... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution further provides that the right of habeas corpus shall remain available and exercisable and shall not be suspended during a state of emergency. Therefore, our courts are opened and shall remain opened at all times for regular operations and to entertain any petition for the writ of habeas corpus, if any that may be filed. We recognize that in these difficult times, the role of the Judiciary in ensuring a civil and an orderly society in which the freedoms, civil liberties and rights of our people are protected is critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Liberian law, the Republic of Liberia, as a party litigant, has no special rights and enjoys no special privileges that are not available to ordinary persons the Republic may bring to court or vice-versa. Instead, the Republic of Liberia is subject to all applicable procedural rules of court as well as applicable substantive laws and shall be treated as such. The only exception to this general rule is in cases where the application of the general rule would compromise national security or a vital national interest. We therefore want to assure all citizens and residents of this nation that during this period of state of emergency, the Judiciary will not relent in its constitutional mandates; it will continue to perform its role as the anchor of our Government to which our people look for redress of their grievances and the guarantor of their freedoms and liberties. Citizens and foreign residents who may be aggrieved during this time are urged to remain law abiding and seek recourse to the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must note, however, that during a state of emergency, the Constitution authorizes the President to exercise a range of powers and to curtail certain rights otherwise available to citizens and residents of this nation during normal times. Therefore, we urge all citizens and foreign nationals residing in our country to be cognizant of the limitations on the exercise of certain constitutional and statutory rights during this period of the state of emergency. They must remain cautious, alert and obey all measures declared and enunciated to fight the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, while our Constitution provides for a government with three co-equal branches, each with separate powers and functions, it is absolutely essential that these branches &quot;coordinate&quot; and cooperate with one another during this critical period of our nation to achieve the common goal of eradicating the Ebola virus. Cooperation by the three branches of the Government especially at this time does not mean that any one branch will relinquish any of its powers to one or the other two branches. It does not mean for example, that the Judiciary will not perform its traditional role as a disinterested and impartial arbiter of disputes, whether such disputes are between the other two branches of the Government, or between one or two of them and one or more private citizens, or between two or more private citizens. What it means is that each branch must work in harmony with the other branches, just as ordinary citizens of this country with different backgrounds and persuasions are required to work together to eradicate the virus. After all, there can be no Legislative, no Executive or Judiciary Branch of Government if the virus overwhelms us all. We must first act to survive as a people, government and country before we can even talk of the separateness of our branches of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this connection, the Judiciary will collaborate with the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government in every lawful venture and initiative in fighting the virus. As a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fight the Ebola virus my Colleagues and I have resolved to contribute and are prepared to one month of our salaries and allowances spread over a period of four months and deducted from our income at a rate of twenty-five percent (25%) per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have conferred with judges of our lower courts and the senior support staff of the Judiciary. They have also agreed to make similar contributions, but theirs will be one-half (1/2) of their monthly salaries and allowances to be deducted in the same manner as stated above. We believe that such contribution should be made by all Liberians. During the coming week, I shall convene a meeting with the general staff of the Judiciary to secure from them similar commitment to contribute to this national cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wish to encourage the members of the Legislative Branch of Government, all Liberian citizens, those working in government and public as well as private corporations, and those who are self-employed(with the exception of doctors, nurses, and other health workers who are our front-line soldiers in the fight against Ebola) to consider making similar contributions to save our people and our nation. As we see it, this contribution is necessary not only to demonstrate our concern and commitment to eradicate the virus from our country, but it will also convey the message of our ownership of the drive to combat and eliminate the virus. And this will even embolden the resolve of the many friendly nations and international organizations that are providing material and human assistance to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are pleased to note that the President was thinking in the same direction, for on September 11, 2014, she addressed a letter to us informing us that she had approved a proposal to have members of the Executive Branch of Government make contribution to the Ebola Trust Fund and solicited our consideration of similar program in the Judiciary. Madam President, we are pleased to identify with this worthy venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strictest accountability mechanism must be put into place to ensure proper use of such funds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Bar, this is a short term. I admonish you to make assignments of your cases early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May God Bless the Works of Our Hands in the Judiciary and Save Our Country</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">690 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems Liberia's 24th President has been listening to, or updated with, angry reactions from some quarters of the Liberian public over her request to maximize the objectives of the state of emergency declared two months ago. The state of emergency was professedly declared to grant Government freehand to fight the raging Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her request to the National Legislature to inhibit citizens' right to freely move, gather, talk, worship and own property has triggered enormous venom from some lawmakers and ordinary citizens who have used the airwaves and the pages of the traditional media as well as social media to slam, censured and protest, some in the crudest of words.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of talking back to critics in similar harsh fashion, the President, who once referred to her critics as &quot;noisy minority&quot; and at one time referring them &quot;to see the psychiatrists&quot; is not sounding bellicose this time. She has toned down the rhetoric, saying she will remain tolerant and respectful to the views of others and not even &quot;disrespect to the office the presidency&quot; will distract her. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has renewed her vow to continue to respect the rights of others and will not change her characteristics of tolerance and understanding people's attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She promised to remain engaged with all those who mean good for the country and no amount of disrespect to the presidency will deter her from performing her constitutional duties. &quot;You can be assured that whatever we do, we do it for the good of this country and my own tolerance, understanding, and respect for the rights of others will never change,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the Liberian leader made the assertion at the end of a prayer service for the country at the Dominion Christian Fellowship Center on Tubman Boulevard on Friday, October 10, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia leader said despite the seriousness of the Ebola fight, there were still some elements of the Liberian society playing politics with the situation. But President Sirleaf assured the congregation that with her engagement with partners, there is now enormous international support coming to Liberia and if Liberians unite in the fight, they will soon reverse the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She admonished all Liberians to continue to pray and at the same time observe all the anti-Ebola measures as released by health authorities and experts. &quot;We have to follow their advice because we want to make sure that we kick this disease out of our country, region and the world which is concerned that it's beginning to also affect them,&quot; President Sirleaf said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leader's comments were in response to a sermon delivered by Bishop Isaac Winker in which he spoke of total disrespect to the presidency, especially by the young people of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Winker said young Liberians were now using the various radio talk shows to abuse free speech and called on them to have a change in attitude. &quot;If you wish to be a national leader tomorrow, it's time now that you gain respect from the people by equally addressing the presidency and other national leaders with respect and dignity,&quot; Bishop Winker told the young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, Liberians accused others of being paid agents whenever they are told the truth about the need to respect the office of the President and by this, he said, did not have any regret for saying this as he was mandated by God to tell the Liberian people. Bishop Winker, during the sermon, delivered a special prayer for Liberia against those he said are bent on preaching war in the country as God has and will always destroy their plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;War mongers,&quot; the Bishop said, &quot;are destined for self destruction as the church will continue to pray and thank God for the ten years of uninterrupted peace that the country recently celebrated since its return to the rule of law through Presidential and Legislative elections in 2005 that brought President Sirleaf to power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service was the seventh edition of a national tarry organized by the Church of Liberia and held at the Dominium Christian Fellowship Center of the Isaac Winker Global Ministry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA screening plans are far from perfect' and will fail to stop the deadly virus hitting Britain, Boris Johnson said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London Mayor joined those questioning Britain's response to the outbreak, following delays and indecision over the introduction of screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest move, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says callers to the NHS's non-emergency 111 helpline will be quizzed about potential exposure to ebola if they report common symptoms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government announced last week that screening would be introduced at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar terminal in London, but has so far failed to say when it will start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson admitted that it was a far from perfect solution' and said it put No?10 at risk of seeming to promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there had been fantastic preparations' to cope with any cases in Britain but warned he still expected to see it reach London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of ebola in this country and probably in this city,' he said, adding that it was impossible to blood test everybody coming into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said the country should expect ebola cases in the coming months. She said screening was a blunt instrument' but insisted it was the right thing to do', adding: It will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country, so I would expect a handful of cases in the next few months.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hunt will make a statement to the Commons today giving greater detail about the screening, and announced that he had asked for 111 workers to refer higher risk' cases to emergency services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callers with potential symptoms of ebola, including breathing problems, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, will be questioned about their travel history and those at risk of exposure will be assessed by ambulance workers with appropriate protective equipment', he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar questionnaires about travel history and potential exposure are expected to be introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal. Travellers arriving from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - the three countries worst hit by the disease - will be quizzed, followed by health checks for those who admit they could have come into contact with the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts warn that people could lie to avoid delays and inconvenience and that anyone with ebola can go for days or even weeks without showing any symptoms. Doctors say screening is unlikely to be effective in stopping the virus from entering Britain and have accused the Government of using it as a political gesture'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, it has been confirmed that a nurse in Texas has tested positive for ebola - the first person known to have caught the disease in America. The woman, who has not been named, had tended to a Liberian victim at a hospital in Dallas and authorities said her diagnosis suggested there had been a breach in safety protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Spain, another nurse who contracted the disease treating patients from West Africa remains in a serious condition in a Madrid hospital, although she is showing signs of slight improvement'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola has killed more than 4,000 in West Africa, although Dr David Nabarro, the British expert in charge of the UN's response, said he hoped the spread of the killer virus will be under control' in three months. Knowledge about the need for quarantine and isolation of sufferers was growing in the region and international help has increased, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has begun loading a hospital ship, RFA Argus, with medicine and equipment to take to West Africa and has promised to deploy 750 soldiers to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship, currently docked in Falmouth, Cornwall, will carry three Merlin helicopters that will be used to transport medics in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British aid flight also landed in Sierra Leone yesterday. It was delivering beds, biohazard suits, tents and ten vehicles, plus equipment for a 92-bed unit being built by a UK team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 20,000 students from the West African region worst hit by the outbreak are studying at British universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleaners in student halls have reported to been warned to watch out for symptoms including signs of blood or vomit in bedrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is spread through contact with body fluids and any outbreak in shared halls could spread quickly with students sharing kitchens and bathrooms. Students have already begun to return but will be monitored for up to three weeks, the maximum incubation period for the virus, The Sunday Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fay Sherrington, student services manager at Lancaster University, said: Most universities are making sure cleaners are briefed on the risks. They have more chance of coming into contact with body fluids because they are cleaning bathrooms in residences.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economists are warning of an &quot;Ebola effect&quot; on cocoa prices, which are already extremely volatile because of parasites, political instability and weather conditions.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cocoa bean farms of West Africa, which are about to start harvesting, have suffered from a lack of investment over the last 20 years and are struggling to satisfy the growing global demand for chocolate products, according to the accountancy firm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - As the Government introduces measures to try to prevent the arrival of Ebola in this country, it could be fatal to forget that the best way to help Britain is to help west Africa. We must bring the crisis under control in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donors must urgently commit financial and human resources and co-ordinate action to tackle what has become a health and economic crisis, but, above all, a human tragedy. The people of west Africa need assistance and they need it now. Tanya Barron CEO, Plan UK London EC1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Of course any decent person must have sympathy for the poor people of west Africa, but surely it is irresponsible to send 750 personnel and a hospital ship to attempt to stem the tide of this terrible illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Ebola is not a world problem at the moment, it certainly could be once the 750 British personnel return from Sierra Leone, any one of them a potential carrier. Ken Drury Nayland, Suffolk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The United Nations and developed countries could assist in controlling the spread of Ebola by helping to install sanitary systems in west African cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Establishing a good source of clean running water and waste disposal would raise the standard of living and health as well as discouraging mosquito breeding. Elizabeth Davies Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Screening for Ebola at airports may be useful, but what about people entering through our ports and ferry terminals? Roy Hughes Bromsgrove, Worcestershire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Ebola virus was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976 and scientists have repeatedly warned that it can pass from animals to humans who prepare or eat infected meat. Five outbreaks in Africa have been linked to handling meat from gorillas, chimps, fruit bats and other animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is estimated that 7,500 tons of bush meat enters Britain every year illegally. Just one piece of infected meat smuggled into the country could unleash Ebola here. Clark Cross Linlithgow, West Lothian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I fail to understand those suggesting mass quarantining for people arriving in Britain and warning of catastrophic consequences because of our high population density (Letters, October 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola is not highly infectious, except by direct bodily fluid contact and, crucially, it is not infectious until a person becomes unwell. Instead of fuelling the hysteria surrounding Ebola in Britain, we must focus on the real problem: controlling it in Africa, regardless of cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the thousands of people who have died from the Ebola virus, just eight deaths tell us most about the disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These eight dead people embody the scale of epidemic that authorities around the world are facing. In mid-September, local administrators, two medical officers and a preacher, accompanied by three journalists, travelled through remote villages of south-east Guinea, where the outbreak first began. They were attempting to educate the local people about how the disease is spread and how to limit the number of people it infected. But things did not go according to plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of delivering their message and moving on to the next village, they went missing. Their bodies were later found in the village latrine. They had been murdered by the villagers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such violence is not an isolated event. There have been other reports of local people attacking hospitals, aid workers and doctors across West Africa. While these communities are ravaged by the infection, they are distrustful and scared of outsiders. They believe that foreigners are bringing the disease and are petrified of coming into contact with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been reports of youths protecting villages and roads with machetes and slingshots. With crushing poverty comes ignorance, fear and superstition. Many prefer to consult tribal doctors who, in reality, provide no remedy against the illness except hope. One bishop in Liberia has announced that he plans to rid the country of the virus with a mass exorcism using Vimto instead of communion wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of the West African countries under siege from the virus have one thing in common: extreme poverty. It is this that makes them so susceptible to such an outbreak. Poor sanitation and nutrition have created the perfect storm for the virus to thrive, while poor transport and communication networks have made any coordinated response almost impossible. So volunteers must traipse from village to village in a desperate attempt to educate the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not only is it dangerous in countries where the people have learned to be scared and distrustful of officials, it is grossly inefficient and time-consuming. The murders not only speak of a petrified, ignorant people. They are also testament to the international community's ignoring of the unfolding tragedy, and how for too long the only help came from a handful of volunteers and small aid agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International health organisations have been woefully, shamefully slow to react. The World Health Organisation (WHO) failed to heed warnings about the severity of the outbreak for months. It only acknowledged the seriousness of the problem on August 8, when it finally declared a global emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberian government has tried to place the blame on its people, arguing that their distrust of healthcare workers, burial practices and disregard for its advice have worsened the outbreak. But that is a simplistic view. The people of these poor nations have been let down by their governments, which have failed to prioritise education and infrastructure development - and the world is now witnessing the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Had Ebola started in a Western country rather than Africa, the global reaction, including that of the WHO, would have been different. The West's response has been terrifyingly myopic. In the globalised world, it was only a matter of time before the infection spread to cities and, from there, to other continents. How could we have been so stupid to think that one of the world's most virulent diseases wouldn't affect us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, each infected person is infecting two more before dying or overcoming the illness. Survival rates are about 50 per cent, dropping to 10 per cent in remote areas with poor water and supplies. The epidemiology comes down to simple maths: it will not be until each infected person infects, on average, fewer than one other that the tide will reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This latest outbreak - by far Ebola's deadliest to date - may in part be due to the pathological qualities of the virus, but it has sprinted ahead while global health authorities plodded along. We can only hope it is not too late to catch up.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITONS displaying symptoms associated with the Ebola virus are to be screened through calls to the NHS's non-emergency 111 phoneline, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Operators of the service are to question callers with a fever, diarrhoea or vomiting about their recent travel history to establish whether they have been to west Africa. Mr Hunt said Britain had &quot;robust and well-tested systems for dealing with any imported case of Ebola&quot;. However, he said: &quot;We keep the need for further measures under review and will never be complacent - so I asked for additional steps to be taken by NHS 111.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now all call handlers on the NHS 111 service are asking anyone reporting potential symptoms of Ebola, such as respiratory problems, high temperatures, or diarrhoea and vomiting, about their recent travel history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the person with symptoms has recently been to west Africa and is at high risk of having been in contact with Ebola, 111 will immediately refer them to local emergency services for assessment by ambulance personnel with appropriate protective equipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement came as Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said there was &quot;no doubt&quot; the deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history would hit Britain. He said he was almost certain that the disease would infect people in the capital. He also suggested airport screening, introduced for passengers travelling from Ebola-hit African countries to Europe and North America, could do little to stop the virus spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Johnson said: &quot;I have no doubt, I have little doubt, that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The idea of screening it at airports is far from perfect as a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's one of those cases where we are at risk of seeming to promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense. You can't blood test everybody coming into the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The comments follow a warning from Dame Sally Davies, the Government's chief medical officer, that cases would be discovered in Britain. &quot;It will not be surprising if we have spillover into this country so I would expect a handful of cases in the next few months,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government has introduced the screening of passengers arriving at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar terminal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NURSE in Dallas who looked after the first Ebola victim to die in the United States contracted the disease despite wearing a full protective gown, gloves and face shield as she cared for him, it emerged yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in Texas said the woman, the first person to contract the virus on US soil, must have breached safety protocols to become infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The discovery of a second case in America prompted President Barack Obama to order authorities to take &quot;additional steps&quot; to contain the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people worldwide this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A White House statement said the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been told to ensure that &quot;federal authorities take immediate additional steps to ensure hospitals and health care providers nationwide are prepared to follow protocols should they encounter an Ebola patient&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest American victim of the disease, who has asked not to be named, had originally been told there was a&quot;low risk&quot; she had been infected before testing positive for Ebola on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was said to have had extensive contact with the first US victim, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Mr Duncan died on Wednesday, two weeks after travelling to the US from Liberia, the west African country where more than 2,300 people have been killed by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was thought to have contracted it while accompanying a dying pregnant woman to hospital in a taxi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Duncan was sent home from hospital the first time he sought help and was admitted four days later, by which time he was contagious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was during this second visit to the hospital that the newly infected nurse began treating him while wearing protective clothing including a gown, gloves and face mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those caring for him believe they abided by CDC guidelines, which stipulate that full protective suits should be worn while treating Ebola victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the nurse was originally allowed to self-monitor her condition along with 48 other health workers who took their own temperature once a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She began to run a low-grade fever on Friday and contacted her superiors to report the situation. A preliminary test found low levels of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials said a second test had con-firmed that she had the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nurse in Spain who treated a dying priest and went on to develop Ebola admitted that she may have touched her face while removing her protective suit, but Dallas health workers argued that they followed procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Tom Freiden, the head of the CDC, said that although the American nurse could not remember making a similar slip, the fact she was infected suggested she must have breached protocols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that other members of the team that cared for Mr Duncan could go on to develop the disease, but was confi-dent that it could be contained by breaking the &quot;chain&quot; of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is deeply concerning that this infection occurred,&quot; he said. &quot;That doesn't change the bottom line here, which is that we know how to break the chain of transmission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest victim was taken into isolation within 90 minutes of arriving in hospital and had contact with only one other person while showing symptoms. She was said to be in a stable condition and had requested &quot;total privacy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clay Jenkins, a Dallas county judge who is in charge of the civilian response to the outbreak, described her as a &quot;heroic person&quot; who was now &quot;going through a great ordeal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr David Lakey, the commissioner of the Texas department of state health services, said: &quot;Is it frightening and disappointing? Of course it is. Our hearts go out to the family and the health care worker, who is infected. She is going to have a rough time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first case of transmission of the virus on US soil has alarmed the authorities and is likely to create panic across America. Judge Jenkins had already been shunned by his neighbours, with parents pulling their children out of his daughters' school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health workers around the world are finding it an increasingly difficult to treat Ebola patients while staying free of the disease. Many complain in particular about the difficulty of working inside hot, uncomfortable suits, which are difficult to remove without becoming exposed to bodily fluids of patients through which the disease is transmitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Liberia, the most severely hit west African country, nurses and doctors are threatening to go on strike unless they receive &quot;hazard pay&quot; of $700 (&pound;436) on top of their salaries. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf toured Ebola treatment units in the capital Monrovia urging staff to remain at their posts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITONS displaying symptoms associated with the Ebola virus are to be screened through calls to the NHS's non-emergency 111 phoneline, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Operators of the service are to question callers with a fever, diarrhoea or vomiting about their recent travel history to establish whether they have been to west Africa. Mr Hunt said Britain had &quot;robust and well-tested systems for dealing with any imported case of Ebola&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said: &quot;We keep the need for further measures under review and will never be complacent - so I asked for additional steps to be taken by NHS 111.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now all call handlers on the NHS 111 service are asking anyone reporting potential symptoms of Ebola, such as respiratory problems, high temperatures, or diarrhoea and vomiting, about their recent travel history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the person with symptoms has recently been to west Africa and is at high risk of having been in contact with Ebola, 111 will immediately refer them to local emergency services for assessment by ambulance personnel with appropriate protective equipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement came as Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, said there was &quot;no doubt&quot; the deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history would hit Britain. He said he was almost certain that the disease would infect people in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also suggested airport screening, introduced for passengers travelling from Ebola-hit African countries to Europe and North America, could do little to stop the virus spreading.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know what 21st-century Britain looks like when things are going well. Something like the London Olympics. And when the sun is out, the vast majority are pretty proud of it. But what happens when skies darken? And they will.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola will cause friction. Until things calm down and the risks are fully understood, pity the dark-skinned figure looking sweaty in a doctor's waiting room or on the underground. And then there is the threat from those besotted with the cult that is Islamic State. They won't forever fail in their efforts to spill blood in British cities. As the IRA once boasted, MI5 has to be lucky every time; terrorists only once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it is worth asking, how will we cope when modern Britain faces its stress test? Will we recognise that there is little use scapegoating; no immunising ourselves from the convulsions of a globalised society? Or will we turn on each other, making a bad situation worse?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One factor will be leadership. After the London bombings of 2005, Ken Livingstone, then mayor, stepped up to the plate with an emotional, inspiring speech, making it clear that the bombers were the enemies of everyone. Theresa May might make a decent fist of that. So might Boris Johnson. He can't do detailed policy, but he can do oratory. When the stress test comes, the key will be finding the right words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be responsibility for the media, too. In the case of Ebola, there have already been suggestions from writers who should know better that we might virtually pull up the drawbridge on west Africa. As if it is possible to quarantine an entire continent. Not a good start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the Sun on Islamic State. Last week, the paper splashed with a picture of a woman in a hijab created from a union flag. Let's all unite to defeat Isis, it said. The initiative triggered complaints from critics who said the Sun had no right to place inordinate onus on ordinary British Muslims. I respect and understand that view. But for all its obvious faults, I thought the Sun was trying its best, within the limits of its genre and with knowledge of its market. It was clumsy, but then the Sun was never big on nuance. Still, better to have it trying to do good than not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers on the Ebola frontline are at the highest risk of contracting the disease. Ebola becomes more contagious the sicker patients get. By the time they are in the care of doctors and nurses, patients have become a serious danger to the lives of those treating, washing and attempting to rehydrate them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in countries such as the US and Spain, which have sophisticated healthcare systems and well-equipped hospitals, healthcare workers should be safe. It is shocking that workers in Spain and now Texas have contracted Ebola from patients they were treating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Medecins sans Frontieres has proved, it is possible to keep health workers safe even in the difficult setting of west Africa, where an isolation ward can be no more than an area behind a canvas tent flap. The vital elements are vigilance and strict adherence to the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Texas health worker was reportedly wearing full protective gear - gown, gloves, mask and shield - while providing care for the patient who later died. Either that equipment failed or correct procedures were not followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Tom Frieden, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested yesterday that there had been a breach in protocol, saying that one focus of the investigation will be the possibility that the health worker took off protective gear incorrectly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal protective suits keep the virus off the body but removing them safely is a skill in itself. It is possible to transfer the virus from the outside of the suit on to the hands. From there it takes a moment's thoughtlessness to touch the face. The virus enters the body through eyes, nose or mouth or any abrasion on the skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa it is so much harder to be safe. The suits are hot, there are not enough available, and doctors and nurses are hard-pressed because there are too few of them to cope with the soaring number of cases. In Liberia there was a critical health worker shortage even before Ebola broke out. Fear over dangerous working conditions was as strong a motivation for recent strikes as very low pay. The government in June doubled the pay of nurses because of the hazard, but was told by the World Bank to rescind the offer, which would have busted the health budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better conditions for health workers in Africa are vital. That is going to have to involve increasing their number and improving training. West Africa needs a great deal of help from the west.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Texas healthcare worker tested positive for Ebola yesterday even though she had worn full protective gear while caring for a patient who later died from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said he was deeply concerned by the apparent breach in protocol which led to the first known case of the disease being contracted in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital officials said the employee had worn a gown, mask and gloves during all contact with Thomas Duncan, who died on Wednesday, 10 days after he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital on his second visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC director, Dr Tom Frieden, said other hospital staff could also have been exposed to the virus and could show symptoms in the coming days. &quot;The healthcare workers who cared for this individual may have had a breach of the same nature,&quot; he said. &quot;It is certainly very concerning and it tells us there is a need to enhance training and make sure protocols are followed,&quot; he said. &quot;The protocols work . . . but we know that even a single lapse or breach can result in infection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDC said the worker, who had been self-monitoring for Ebola symptoms, reported a low-grade fever on Friday and was referred for testing. She was promptly isolated, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's deeply concerning that this infection occurred,&quot; Frieden said. &quot;We can't let any hospital let its guard down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Texas health commissioner, David Lakey, said the test confirming the woman's infection showed lower levels of the virus than in Duncan's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman was not among the 48 people who may have had contact with Duncan and were being monitored during the virus's 21-day incubation period. They are so far asymptomatic. Lakey said health officials were working to identify people who may have had contact with the female worker once she started showing symptoms and became contagious. Frieden said that so far they had found only one such person, who is &quot;under active monitoring&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 September, Duncan went to the hospital for treatment but was sent away with antibiotics after hospital staff seemingly failed to consider the possibility of Ebola despite being made aware of his travel history. He then fell gravely ill and was rushed to the hospital on 28 September, where he was isolated. His diagnosis was confirmed on 30 September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dallas officials were criticised for their sluggish response to Duncan's diagnosis, which left several quarantined family members stuck in their apartment for several days before they were taken to an undisclosed location and a hazardous-materials cleaning crew arrived to decontaminate their home. This time round the officials are at pains to stress they have acted more decisively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas, said a team &quot;has decontaminated the common areas and any open areas of an apartment complex . . . they sprayed with a decontaminant, a clean-up agent and right now police are standing by to make sure no one enters. Furthermore, we have knocked on every door in that block and helped every single person who came to the door, and explained what has happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media images showed a police officer blocking the entrance to a small apartment building less than four miles north-east of downtown Dallas and four miles south of the hospital where Duncan died. Similar images showed a yellow barrel containing hazardous waste sitting on the front lawn of the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A neighbour, Cliff Lawson, 57, told Reuters he was woken at 6am by two Dallas police officers, who told him not to panic. &quot;I went back to bed after that. There's nothing you can do about it. You can't wrap your house in bubble wrap,&quot; Lawson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enhanced screenings of travellers arriving at five major US airports from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea began at JFK in New York on Saturday. Newark, Washington Dulles, Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare will follow suit on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 4,000 people in the three west African countries have died from the current Ebola outbreak, according to the CDC.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Johnson has said there is little doubt a case of Ebola will emerge in the UK and this will most probably be in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London mayor also admitted health checks at UK airports were a &quot;far from perfect solution&quot; and cautioned the government against seeming to &quot;promise stuff that doesn't really make any sense&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the outbreak continues to spread across west Africa, Johnson suggested the best thing the UK could do was to be prepared for a new case of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of Ebola in this country and probably in this city,&quot; he told the BBC's the Andrew Marr Show. &quot;All I can tell you is that to the best of my knowledge . . . we have fantastic preparations in London for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will today say phone calls to the NHS's non-emergency 111 line are to be screened for possible Ebola sufferers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call handlers on the service are to question anyone ringing up with possible symptoms of the disease about their recent travel history, to see if they have been to west Africa, where the death toll has passed 4,000 people, Hunt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron initially resisted the idea of screening for Ebola at key airports and ports, but soon afterwards he ordered health checks on passengers entering the UK from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there are no direct routes to the UK from these countries, people who have taken connecting flights will face questionnaires and medical assessments, but not temperatures checks as in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guidance changed a few days after a Spanish nurse became the first person to contract the illness on European soil while caring for two repatriated missionaries who had been working in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the screening has come in for criticism from some quarters, as incoming passengers may not yet display symptoms of Ebola when they are being screened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson added his voice to the criticism, saying he understood &quot;why people don't understand&quot; the new measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't blood test everybody coming into the country . . .The idea of screening at airports is, I'm afraid, far from perfect as a solution. What you need to do is make sure people coming from the affected countries are properly screened, when they leave. They shouldn't be allowed to leave if they have been in contact with people in one of the affected areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said it would not be surprising if there was a &quot;spillover&quot; of Ebola into the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical staff and emergency services conducted a disaster preparation exercise this weekend, with hospitals now on standby. Cameron said steps were being taken to &quot;keep people safe here&quot;, adding: &quot;We listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice and that's why we're introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a round of broadcast interviews, David Nabarro, the UN special envoy on Ebola, said the global authorities have given themselves three months to get the virus under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was spreading &quot;exponentially&quot; across west Africa but there was a very good chance of meeting this target, of seeing the number of new cases reduce week by week, by next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Sky News's Murnaghan programme, Andrew Mitchell, a senior Conservative and former international development secretary, called on the world to line up behind the UN to tackle Ebola in Africa and increase its containment efforts twentyfold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It is very important that the principal countries with historic links in the area are very fully engaged. Sierra Leone is a country with which Britain has very deep and long historic links, for Liberia the same thing is true of America and Guinea has French connections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour criticised Johnson for failing to provide solid reassurances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luciana Berger, the party's public health spokeswoman, said: &quot;People want reassurance that robust preparations are being made. Boris Johnson should focus on explaining what plans are in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office of the Vice President of the Republic of Liberia over the weekend received overwhelming supports in appreciation to his kind gesture in at least landing arms of assistance to several communities and Ebola Centers in and out of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation exercise which took place around Monrovia benefited several Ebola Centers including ELWA-2 Ebola Center along the Roberts International Highway, the John F. Kennedy Clora Unit in Sinkor and the Island Clinic Ebola Unit in Tweh Farm outside Monrovia and the Benson Hospital in Paynesville.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other benefiting Organizations and communities were, Montserrado County District 6 Ebola Taskforce Office in Paynesville, the Benson Street Mosque on Benson Street in Monrovia, the Christian Association of the Blind and Samaritan's Purse along the Roberts International Highway, the National Union of Organization for the Disabled on 17th Street in Monrovia, the Power Plant Community in West Point, a suburb of Monrovia, Soniwein Community and Buzzi Quarters respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the presentation on behalf of VP Boakai, the Chairman for Special Project in the office of VP Boakai, Peter Stephens told the recipients that the Vice President of the Republic of Liberia pitied their condition especially during this time of health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Stephens, the office of the Vice President could not remain mute and see Liberians go through this hurtful time, when hundreds of their relatives were dying on a daily basis. He however called on all Liberians and health workers to see the fight of the Ebola epidemic as a national endeavor and join government as it tackles the eradication of the virus from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, UNESCO Peace Ambassador to the Liberia, Rev. Dr. J. Luther Tarpeh and close friend of his, the Vice President of the Republic of Liberia assured the beneficiaries that the VP Boakai understands the hardship that has been caused by the Ebola epidemic in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Tarpeh who has been in the fight seeking the country's transformation from where it is to a better place to be for all Liberians and foreign nationals told the desperate crowd that VP Boakai should now be seen as an agent of change and one with loving heart and not just a public figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Tarpeh said Ambassador Boakai has proven to the vast majority of the Liberian people how deeply his commitment to seeking the interest of the ordinary man than speaking mere words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not time to speak, but it is the time that everyone needs to work, and that your work will show who you are,&quot; Rev. Tarpeh stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two officials also assured patients and health workers that although the Ebola virus has completely broken down the already fragile health system in the country, but Government was doing everything possible to see that at least some improvements are made to help curtail the damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items separately on behalf of their various institutions, ELWA Acting Hospital Managements, Mrs. F. Kolu Mulbah Kamah and Samaritan Purse's Acting Country Director Dorothy Blie lauded the Vice President of the Republic of Liberia for the gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their parts, JFK's Logistic Coordinator who received their share of the donation on behalf of his Boss, Abraham M. Attoh, Edward Sumo of Buzzi Quarter, Adolphus Kiazulu of Soniwein and West Pont Power Plant Community Chairman, Paul Bobby Keah also used the occasion to call on others to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to them, the Vice President of the Republic of Liberia has been in the vanguard of extending assistance to needy communities. They lauded VP Boakai for his continuous supports and promised to extend the message to the vast populace of their kinsmen and ordinary residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Beyan Cottah is calling on local and international partners in the country to join Vice President Joseph N. Boakai in meeting the needs of the common people of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an impressive ceremony at the Grand Masonic Temple at West Benson Street, the Grand Lodge, joined by the General Grand Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star, presented 175 bags of rice, 200 quarts of cooking oil, 3,000 bottles of mineral water, 1,000 packs of cream crackers, and 1,200 bottles of mixed juices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation was made to seven medical institutions and ambulance crews that are in the front line of the fight against the Ebola virus. They include, Redemption Hospital, SOS Hospital, Harbel Medical Center, Tubmanburg Medical Center, Phebe Hospital &amp; Ebola Containment Center, JFK Hospital &amp; Ebola Containment Center, ELWA Hospital &amp; Ebola Containment Center, and Ebola Ambulance personnel in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Grand Master, Right Worshipful, Brother Anthony W. Deline, speaking on behalf of the Grand Master, Most Worshipful Brother James E.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rice and cooking oil are intended for the medical workers, while the cream crackers, juices and mineral water are intended for patients who are being treated for the Ebola virus in the containment centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also making remarks was the General Grand Matron of the Order of the Eastern Star, Worthy Sister Patricia Mcintosh, who said that the sisters of the Fraternity were happy to identify with the charity donation because the key purpose of the Eastern Star is Charity and love for humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the program, Hon. Mary Broh, Director General of the General Services Agency, Hon. Clara Doe, Mayor of the City Corporation of Monrovia and Hon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As health workers at Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Monrovia complain about the unit being full and no bed available to accept patients that are showing symptoms of the Ebola virus, the Ebola Treatment Unit in Suakoko, Bong County have 70 beds and there are always beds available because once you are tested and you are negative; you will be treated quickly and released to avoid the patient coming in contact with the Ebola virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the ETU that was built by Save the Children and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), both international and local journalists observed on Tuesday that the ETU is at an isolated area where one has to drive fifteen minutes from the main road before he/she could arrive there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ETU is being run by International Medical Corps, a non- governmental organization and the team's director for Liberia Ebola Emergency Response, Sean Casey stressed that test results to come in after 3 or 5 days now takes 3 to 4 hours and patients are informed if they are positive or negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Casey, if a result of a patient shows that he/she does not have the Ebola virus, that patient is discharged the same day or the next morning. But if the result shows positive that patient starts treatment immediately and they are removed from the suspected ward to the Confirmed Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He narrated that is why patients are being released every day because they show no sign of the Ebola virus. He mentioned that there are 20 beds in the suspected ward and 50 beds in the confirm ward and that the ETU is divided into two areas, the lower and higher risks area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that the ETU has two ambulances and that most of the patients come in ambulance and that they don't usually have to walk. Mr. Casey said there is no need to expand the ETU for now but if the need arises they will expand the ETU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists were taken to the burial site which was ten minutes' walk from the ETU. At the burial site reporters talked with one of the grave diggers, James Jensen, who said they are being stigmatized by neighbors because of the work they are doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised International Medical Corps and USAID for the work they are doing for the people of Liberia. He said Liberians are dying from the deadly disease every day, because there are people who are still denying the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

Doctor Jim Czarnik who is the Chief Medical Officer of the U.S. Military here in Liberia stated that the U.S. government is putting everything it has to fight the Ebola virus and that the Department of Defense of the United States is bringing in more labs in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is state of the art equipment being used in the lab to help fight the Ebola virus by sending results to the ETU within 3 to 4 hours. The equipment cost little under half million dollars and that they have also received blood samples from Lofa, Nimba, Grand Gedeh and Margibi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the John F. Kennedy ETU being closed met up with serious reaction when several patients who were taken there were refused by nurses who were demanding better working condition from the Government of Liberia, leaving one person dead and another patient abandoned by the strike action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the nurses, (name withheld) who spoke to the INQUIRER complained that they have been working under very deplorable condition which they have since complained to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, but with no redress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believed, going on strike is the right decision to claim the attention of relevant authorities,&quot; the nurse stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on Saturday of last week, a man believed to be in his early twenties was abandoned to death and another left in the open by the nurses assigned at that ETU who laid down their working tools, complaining that their lives were not secured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the nurses said, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has over and over refused to listen to their pleas appertaining to some better and safety measures they believed could have been positive for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, when the INQUIRER visited the Island Clinic in Tweh Farm, several nurses and Doctors were seen freely perambulating the vicinity of the hospital in protest to what they claimed the Ministry of Health's continuous failure to listen to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Justine Dewarlie, a Hygienic working at the Clinic, the Government of Liberia has paid lip service to their plea. She said, since they were transferred to the Island Clinic from the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, there has been serious problems between they and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justine Dewarlie cited salary reduction as the major hindrance to their work. &quot;We have earlier agreed through a communiqu&eacute; between us and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to be paid at least US500, 00 but contrary to the communiqu&eacute;, the Ministry has only paid us for two weeks in August, an amount of US250, 00,&quot; Justine stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinic which has more than one-hundred patients admitted on Friday, was a scene of chaos when the Ministry of Health sent a new Administrator to take over from the Ugandan Doctor, Dr. Atat Omoruto who is currently assigned at the Island Clinic but met up with serious resistance from workers, prompting the intervention of Montserrado County District 6 Representative Edwin M. Snowe who came and calmed the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile when contacted yesterday, Assistant Health Minister, Tolbert Nyenswah denied the closure of the JFK ETU, but said through a mutual agreement between the two parties, (Health Workers and the Ministry), the health workers have agreed to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said, previously, the Ministry of Health and Health Workers earlier agreed upon Doctors receiving an amount of USD1500, 00, while nurses should receive US750, 00 when there were only two ETU's at the time, the ELWA-2 and Lofa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, after other facilities ETUs were created and, the Ministry decided to renegotiate the agreement, something which created serious problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyenswah said efforts are on the way to better strengthen the agreement to avoid future embarrassment or recurrence of the September incidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Coleman who is Chairman on Senate Committee intimated that the situation currently was not healthy for the already fragile health system in the country. &quot;I would like to appeal to the National Health Workers Association of Liberia to kindly reconsider their decision to go on a go-slow action, any 'go-slow' action will seriously hamper the concerted effort of the Government of Liberia and the international community to contain and stop the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Liberia, the sub region and the rest of the world; it will also impede our effort at restoring essential health services in our country,&quot; Senator Coleman stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He intimated that efforts need to be exerted to find an amicable solution to the health crisis. &quot;We also want to appeal to the Executive Branch of Government and to President Ellen-Johnson Sirleaf for consideration of the appeal made by the Health workers of this country who are the front liners in the fight against the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) to have the president and the Secretary General of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia, that were dismissed by the Ministry of Health, re-instated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Liberian Senate, the Council of Traditional Chiefs &amp; Elders and the Council of Churches have also appealed to the President to have the health workers re-instated in order for the full functioning of all health facilities be convenient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What appears to be looming setback for the fight against the Ebola pestilence is evolving again as Liberian health workers are threatening a strike action today, October 13, 2014, over what they say is Government's refusal to settle their compensation requests despite &quot;risking our lives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers preferring anonymity told The Analyst at the newly opened Island Clinic Ebola Treatment unit (ETU) while &quot;we are already underpaid for this dangerous work we are doing, the Government is founding it difficult to pay us on time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers said they are faced with many challenges as frontline soldiers in the fight against the Ebola virus yet the government has failed to recognize their efforts and sacrifices made in the interest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggrieved health workers who spoke in an angry mood said if they were not treated properly and humanely by paying them on time, the government will have itself to blame. &quot;We will ground tools and will never return to work,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also confided to The Analyst that it is their plan to lay down their tools and stay away from work effective today, Monday, October 13, 2014 if the government played down their demand. The workers are calling for better working conditions, including salary increment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the health workers' president, Mr. Joseph Tamba, is appealing to his colleagues to turn out for work and wait for the government's response as the association was expected to intervene quickly so that they continue to take care of Ebola beleaguered patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government has no reason to pay less attention to the plight of health workers &quot;who are to God in the times of saving lives of Liberians afflicted by a deadly virus&quot;. He further encouraged public health workers to remain calm and do their work in the interest of the patients and not for the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Liberian officials are pleading with nurses and physician assistants to show up to work Monday amid a dispute over &quot;hazard pay&quot; that has prompted calls for a strike in the middle of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strike could deliver a serious blow to the fight against Ebola in Liberia, where the World Health Organization has recorded more than 2,300 confirmed, suspected and probable deaths from the deadly disease -- more than any other country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf personally toured Ebola treatment units around Monrovia on Saturday asking health workers to remain in their posts, assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah said Sunday. &quot;Everybody is appealing because it has adverse and very negative consequences on people suffering from Ebola and the progress made with the fight,&quot; Nyenswah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the National Health Workers Association are demanding $700 in monthly hazard pay on top of monthly salaries that are generally around $200 or $300. Monthly hazard pay is currently less than $500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association boasts more than 10,000 members, though the health ministry says only about 1,000 of those are employed at sites receiving Ebola patients. George Williams, the association's secretary-general, said he was waiting for the government to address their specific demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to this point, nobody has come to us to resolve them, so the strike action stands for Monday,&quot; he said. &quot;Our doors are still open to negotiation and we are waiting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the government of rushing to license nursing students to replace striking professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are planning to hire people to take our places. Because of that they don't want to engage us,&quot; he said. More than 4,000 people have died in the ongoing Ebola epidemic, according to World Health Organization figures published Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease is spread via the bodily fluids of infected patients, leaving health workers especially vulnerable. More than 400 health workers have contracted the disease -- about half of them in Liberia, where personal protective equipment is scarce. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone have recorded 95 health worker deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the first Ebola cases were confirmed in Guinea back in March, Liberia agreed to pay $700 per month in hazard pay because there were only two treatment centers and far fewer health workers involved, Nyenswah said. As the epidemic and efforts to contain it expanded, however, that commitment placed a &quot;huge financial burden on the state,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government then lowered the monthly hazard allowance to $435 per month. By comparison, doctors receive at least $825 in monthly hazard pay, and their salaries are more than double most other health workers, Nyenswah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary Liberians expressed alarm on Sunday at the prospect of a strike, saying it could cripple the campaign against Ebola just as the international community ramped up assistance. Over 300 U.S. troops are currently on the ground in Liberia, and U.S. officials say up to 4,000 could ultimately be deployed to increase the number of treatment units and available beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia Moulton, principal of the Ronald Reagan Institute, a day-care and elementary school in the Monrovia suburb of Bardnersville, asked the government to negotiate with health workers to keep them on the job. &quot;If they leave work, we will go on the rampage as patients also start to leave,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentecostal preacher Kortu Brown, vice president of the Liberian Council of Churches, asked leaders &quot;to pray and work together&quot; to resolve the impasse. &quot;To put it simply, (a strike) will be a blow and it is something that we should avoid,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">973 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic pundits, like their medical counterparts, have been predicting doom for countries hit by Ebola and that if nothing is done to avert its spread to other African countries, the catastrophe would be record high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the economic experts, the African economy would bleed some $52b if the Ebola menace is not contained quickly in the affected countries. The fact of the matter, which even non-economists know, is that the pestilence-hit countries, particularly hardest affect Liberia, would need much to do economically to cope with the slump that is deepening by the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that is why the doors of some major revenue-generation hubs of the country are still fighting tooth and nail to keep up the economic pace despite the raging impact of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with Allafrica.com's Reed Kramer, the Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), Cllr. Althea Sherman, says the fledgling oil economy is not let to die under dire national health circumstances but that its opens remain open for business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has entered discussions with major international oil companies to encourage bids for drilling in four blocks off the coast near the capital Monrovia. The talks are progressing - including road shows last month in Houston, London and Lagos - despite the Ebola outbreak currently wracking the West African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberia is still open for business,&quot; said Althea Sherman, chief operating officer and general counsel for Liberia's National Oil Company (NOCAL), the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the oil sector. &quot;This bid round is very important for the country,&quot; she said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have attracted some of the world's leading oil companies to our acreage already, and we hope this transparent, competitive round will attract similar participation.&quot; She said the bid round is being conducted &quot;according to international best practices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOCAL engaged the UK-based professional consulting firm Ernst and Young to help develop pre-qualifications and bid evaluations. TGS, a Norway-based geoscientific company, is providing the detailed data that petroleum companies require.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exploration by international companies in the deep and ultra-deep waters of offshore Liberia for the past several years has yet to produce a confirmed commercially exploitable discovery. But Sherman said drilling has shown &quot;a working hydro-carbon system in the acreage. That is why we have continued interest in both the Liberia Basin, where drilling is now going on, and in the Harper Basin that has not yet been put up for tender.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are being asked to bid on an upfront payment, or &quot;signature bonus&quot;, for each of the four blocks that are available. The current bid round includes an &quot;innovative local content incentive&quot; that provides opportunities for mentorship and assistance to Liberian companies. It extends to Liberian companies and Liberia's neighbors in the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidders can qualify for a signature bonus preference if they have a Liberian company or West African/ECOWAS upstream petroleum company with an interest in a Liberian company in their bidding group. Qualifying bidders will receive &quot;a 20 percent uplift on their signature bonus proposal&quot;, meaning that a U.S. $30 million signature bonus will be treated as a $36 million bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four undrilled blocks up for bid were part of earlier rounds in which 12 blocks were put up for contracts. Two of the four blocks in the current round were awarded in 2005 to the American oil company Anadarko and two partners, which relinquished their claims in 2013 to focus on other projects. Two other blocks became available after China's TongTai Petroleum failed to conclude the required production-sharing agreement with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that there is continuous activity in all the blocks to increase the value of our acreage,&quot; Sherman said. &quot;Exploration is how we get to commercial viability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has 17 offshore oil blocks, 12 of which - including the four in the current round - have been awarded to international oil companies, including ExxonMobil (one block), Chevron (three), and African Petroleum and Anadarko (two each).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining undrilled blocks are subject to a moratorium imposed by the Liberian legislature pending adoption a revised petroleum law. The Liberian Senate has adopted the legislation and the House is expected to act soon. &quot;Ebola has heightened the importance of oil to the country's future,&quot; Sherman said. &quot;Liberia needs the support of the international community, not only for Ebola, but also to maintain our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most drilling activities are continuing, Liberian officials report. But ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson said last week that his company's plans to begin offshore drilling had been postponed due to a prohibition on some employee travel to affected West African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are having to look at when it would be prudent to resume operations there because you do have to have shore-based support,&quot; he said in response to questions at a Houston news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But interest in Liberia's oil remains. Road shows last month conducted by Sherman and NOCAL CEO Dr. Randolph McClain to brief interested bidders drew capacity attendance in London, Houston and Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current Bid Round will raise money for the country and open the way for development of the vacated acreage, thereby increasing Liberia's prospects for commercial discovery and development,&quot; NOCAL states in an October 2014 Fact Sheet distributed to interested parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deadlines for submitting bids are 24 October for international oil companies and 31 October for Ecowas and Liberian participants. Nocal expects to notify winners on or around 24 November and to receive signature bonus and award license payments around mid-December.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">833 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Liberian human rights activist, Dan Saryee, says despite the House's rejection of President Sirleaf for additional powers under the state of emergency declared in August, the entire exercise was premised on fraud and both the Executive and Legislature are supreme culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saryee, who is the Senior Policy Director at the Institute of Research and Democratic Development (IREED), said his organization strongly questions the constitutionality of the state of emergency because its passage was characterized by fraudulent practices, lacks transparency and failed to generate the required two-thirds vote in the lower house of the legislature.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement issued over the weekend, Dan Saryee said from IREDD's monitoring of legislative business corroborated by minutes kept on the journal of the Legislature's 49th session, the House session at which the decision was made was attended by only 44 members of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of the 44 members who attended session, 40 voted for, 2 abstained and 2 against,&quot; Saryee said, and added, &quot;If you do the mathematics to determine two-thirds votes of the 73 members, the result gives you 49 members to generate the constitutionally required two-thirds vote from the House of Representatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But shockingly, Mr. Saryee said, the resolution which is supposedly the outcome of the votes taken in plenary, carried 52 signatures something far more than the 44 members who were present in plenary when the votes were taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saryee pointed out that there are contradicting figures between votes taken in plenary and members who signed the so-called Resolution, something he said &quot;represents fraudulent behavior, dishonesty and entrenched lack of transparency within the legislature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, this raises constitutional question around the state of emergency which is being used as the basis to give President Sirleaf unrestricted spending power - a government that has no credential of accounting for public money under normal circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 88 of the Constitution states: &quot;The Legislature shall within seven-two hours, by joint resolution voted by two-thirds of the membership of each house, decide whether the proclamation of a state of emergency is justified or whether the measures taken thereunder are appropriate. If the two-thirds vote is not obtained, the emergency automatically shall be revoked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IREDD Policy Director indicated that the Legislature is the oversight body of government representing the critical mass of the Liberian population with responsibility to ensure the social, economic and political rights of the Liberian people are protected at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As representatives of the people, he said, &quot;the Legislature did nothing to weigh the social and economic ramifications of imposing an unjustified state of emergency on a population that survives on 'daily hustle' to make ends meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, he said, while the commoners are knocked down amidst the collapse of petit trade and other sources of economic activities, well placed governmental authorities are privileged to use their positions to makea fabulous living outside of accountability safeguards under the protection of an illegal state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a consequence of the imposition of an illegitimate and unconstitutional Emergency, the country has been militarized and a strongly restrictive curfew imposed, leading to the wanton abuse of human rights, including the brutalization of citizens, intimidations and harassment of the Liberian people under the disguise of fighting Ebola,&quot; Saryee opined. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As though the recent AFL brutalities and flagrant violation of citizens' rights in West Point and other parts of the County is inadequate, president Sirleaf requests a more draconian power to control civil liberties and fundamental rights - an action reminiscent of the infamous Degree 88A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Sirleaf needs not be dressed in dictatorial 'attires' to be able to curtail the rapid transmission of Ebola, which the government has been fighting without a winning plan. What the government needs is commitment and a comprehensive strategy,&quot; Saryee further asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taking cue from the debates that have attended the accountability requirements of the $5 million authorized by the legislature to fight Ebola,&quot; the IREDD executive said his organization suspects that while the allocation of resources is necessary to combat Ebola, elite politicians' quest for the accumulation of wealth under a loose emergency regime dominates the propounded desire to use state finances for legitimate cause - control and eliminate Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hence, state of emergency would ultimately serve as protectorate for economic crimes for a political administration that has demonstrated no remorse for public accountability and fiscal integrity,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fight against Ebola has sadly taken the traditional blame apportioning attitude as is often done in the fight against corruption, job creation, road construction as well as the healthcare and education systems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive Director of the Foundation for International Dignity (FIND) Roosevelt Woods has condemned the decision of the International Medical Corps to dismiss Martha Morris from the Bong County Ebola Treatment Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's decision against the Bong County Health Workers President came as a result of a recent go-slow action by nurses and support staff at the center over salary incentives owed them by the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers told The Analyst that clothing to protect them was inadequate and there was only one broken stretcher to carry both patients and corpses, increasing the risk of infection. The aggrieved health workers claimed that the International Medical Corps (IMC) - the group managing the ETU - has refused to pay their arrears in the tone of US$ 560 as per their contracts signed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the first contractual period with the IMC has elapsed and they wanted a new agreement signed before resuming work for October. The nurses told Analyst their stance is based on the IMC's decision not to hire them without a formal contract. The workers also complained that despite agreement with the county health team to provide them food at the ETU, IMC has failed to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to workers' claims, IMC said that the health workers and support staff did not work for 30 days, saying that they have resolved to pay them US$350. Bong County Senator Henry Yallah and Superintendent Selena Polson Mappy quoting authorities of the IMC told local Radio stations in the county last week that the organization agreed to reconsider all other health workers and support staff with the exception of Martha Morris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senator Yallah and Superintendent Mappy quoted IMC authorities as saying Martha Morris orchestrated the go-slow action and therefore could no longer make business with her. Roosevelt Woods described the action of the IMC as an attempt to silent critical voices amongst health workers in the country. Woods told this station the IMC acted in error by deducting two hundred U.S dollars from the workers after signing a contract of six hundred dollars with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even if the health workers and support staff did not work for thirty days as claimed by the IMC, the workers or the county health team should have been informed prior to the payment date. Woods said though International partners have come to assist Liberia in eradicate the Ebola virus disease in the country, they must not engage in acts to exploit the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described statement by Senator Yallah that IMC said any attempt accept Martha Morris will lead to its departure from the treatment unit as an understatement. The FIND boss said IMC and other Partners are receiving funding from the World Bank, the WHO and other financial institutions to fight Ebola in Liberia and must not used their interventions to deny Liberian health workers and other contractors their just benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods called on the International Medical Corps to reinstate the Bong County health workers Association President to ensure smooth collaboration at the Ebola Treatment Unit in Suakoko District. He said FIND Human Rights Monitors in Bong County are closely following activities at the ETU and though Ebola is devastating the country his Organization with not relent in ensuring the right of people are respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Martha Morris described as &quot;a watch hunt&quot; decision by the International Medical Corps to terminate her services at the Suakoko Ebola Treatment Unit. Ms. Morris in an interview with Radio Gbarnga said she is disappointed in the statement of Senator Henry Yallah and termed the action as watch hunting because of her critical stance on issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was unfortunate that Senator Yallah and Superintendent Mappy went public with findings after their inquiry with the IMC and the aggrieved health workers without informing her. The National Health workers Association Bong Chapter President said the action of the IMC proves the organization insensitivity to the welfare of health workers and support staff at the Ebola treatment Unit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">795 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Bank President Dr. Jim Yong Kim says the world community is united with West Africa and Liberia in a concerted global effort to safeguard lives in the wake of an Ebola outbreak, noting &quot;we are with you and will stand by you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said over many years, the world community &quot;has failed to make [basic health care] accessible to low-income people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. So now thousands of people in these countries are dying because, in the lottery of birth, they were born in the wrong place.&quot; Dr. Kim made the remarks at a special organized meeting with the Liberia delegation on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF annual meetings convening in Washington DC, USA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are with you. The international response was slow from the beginning. It took long time to get to you, but be assured that we are with you,&quot; Dr. Kim said and added, &quot;If we have the local health people to do the work on the ground, let them to do it. What has happened in the past is that there has been low expectation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outspoken Bank President told the Liberian delegation more focus would be placed on stopping Ebola, adding, &quot;All of us at global level failed first, but now, we are with you. What we are trying to do is not to fail you. We cannot allow to fail you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that if much is not done and soon, the infection would continue to spread to other countries and even continents, &quot;as we have seen with the first Ebola case in the United States this past week. This pandemic shows the deadly cost of unequal access to basic services and the consequences of our failure to fix this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, as a consequence, the ability to boost shared prosperity in West Africa -- and potentially the entire continent -- may be quickly disappearing. Dr. Kim lamented that the world's response to date has been inadequate, and that it has been painful to see a replay old failure from previous epidemics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised the delegation that the Bank would continue to remain engaged with the affected countries, noting &quot;overall, we have pledged $400 million to support treatment and containment. And we have devoted our considerable analytical resources to show that acting now will save hundreds of millions, if not tens of billions of dollars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting comes at a time when Liberia is experiencing the worst ever outbreak of the &quot;Ebola Virus Disease&quot; (EVD), which has claimed many lives, posing further risk of exposure to the larger population and a severe impact on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Liberia's Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh highlighted the government's current challenge and the gains that have been recorded so far in the fight against Ebola, but warned a lot more is needed to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to revamp the entire health sector. Our health system has been affected greatly. The economy, which was projected at 5.9 percent has now come down to one percent. It is in recession,&quot; Mr. Konneh informed the Bank President. He called on the international community not to forget about the economic consequences. &quot;We want to fight Ebola and at the sometime we want to finish quickly so we can start the recovery process so that our citizens can regain their livelihood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh explained that the service sector was the hardest hit which is declining significantly to some 10 percent. &quot;We have to achieve two things; To Tell the Liberian story in the context of the MRU story, to mobilize for an effective resources for an effective response for the Ebola the virus and at the same time strengthen the health care delivery system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He encouraged the Bank and other partners to increase their support to the affected countries, looking beyond the aftermath of the crisis. &quot;We want quality healthcare for our people, but even after Ebola, communities devastated by this outbreak will need to rebuild, accelerate economic activity and drive back livelihood.&quot; He thanked the Bank and other partners for the level of support so far, which he says is boosting government's Ebola response activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Konneh and delegation, including the Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia, Dr. Mills Jones, Dr. Francis Kateh, of the Ministry of Health and Representative Munah Pelham are scheduled to hold series of multilateral and bilateral discussions aimed at rallying support for the government's &quot;National Ebola Response Strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the latest death toll from Ebola now at 3,439 in the three worst-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, a new economic impact assessment from the World Bank Group says that if the epidemic was to significantly infect people in neighboring countries, some of which have much larger economies, the two-year regional financial impact could reach US$32.6 billion by the end of 2015.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1000 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many medical pundits have blamed Liberia's high fatalities against Ebola to poor medical procedures particularly the lack of capacity to promptly diagnose and separate actual Ebola cases from other ailments that are traditional to Liberia and treatable. Many times victims died waiting for results of tests done for days and recently for hours at times from faraway places. And the surge continues to rise, creating trepidations and nervousness at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all that is to become history soon because one of world's electronic giants, Philips, is putting finishing touches on a new device that will produce nearly instant results of tests on suspected Ebola infectees; courtesy of former Public Works Minister in the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf administration, Samuel Kofi Woods, who successfully made a passionate case while visiting the United States. The Analyst reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philips Corporation, an electronics manufacturing giant says it will soon roll out an improved diagnosis equipment for the quick detection of Ebola. Mr. Ties Kroezen, Venture Manager of Philips Africa's Incubator, made the disclosure during a meeting with Atty. Samuel Kofi Woods, II, Liberia's Leading Human Rights Lawyer, in the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Ties Kroezen the new testing equipment which will take seconds to diagnose Ebola, will be rolled in out after approval by the WHO. &quot;It is expected that when this machine comes into use, it will take a shorter time to diagnose cases of Ebola, Kroezen told Attorney Woods. Philips needs to improve on existing software and obtain approval from the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, who recently concluded several high level meetings in the United States in search of aid for Liberia in the fight against the Ebola epidemic, as well as support to build Liberia's healthcare infrastructure has also met with Dutch Parliamentarians, Development Organizations and corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods said his mission is to muster consolidated programs and effective international coordination to intervene in the current Ebola emergency as well as to advocate for a long-term plan and strategy to improve and upgrade Liberia's antiquated healthcare system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any further delay in delivering much needed logistics and supplies to Liberia will lead to the death of many more people and this is morally unacceptable. Liberia needs help, and it needs it urgently. This is a global tragedy. Send us medical help and everything else that would help us deal with this catastrophe. We need medical practitioners, doctors, logisticians, ambulances, mobile clinics and we need help in building both institutional and human capacity in the medium and long term,&quot; says Samuel Kofi Woods, II, Liberia's Human Rights Lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods then emphasized the need for governments, international organizations and wealthy individuals to assist the struggling people of Liberia by providing more ambulances, mobile clinics, testing equipment and other assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended the international community for their commitment to assist but declared &quot;that it is too slow in arriving and the help might just be useless when it arrives&quot;. We need URGENT ACTION AND WE NEED IT NOW! In another development, Woods has asked Save the Children-Netherlands and other children's and relief organizations to develop and design programs to address the plight of children who have been orphaned by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to officials of Save the Children- Netherlands, Woods emphasized the need to pay attention to kids who have become orphaned as a result of the Ebola Virus while implementing normal Ebola protection programs and building treatment centers. These kids are victims and they stigmatized like other survivors. They need to be de-traumatized and de-stigmatized&quot; Woods noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, who serves as an Ambassador of Save The Children -Netherlands on the group's campaign to educate the Dutch Public about the Ebola Virus and to solicit support from the Dutch public for the Ebola fight in West Africa, said he plans on developing a celebrity network to create awareness and increase international attention on eradicating the virus as well as emphasize the need to de-stigmatize it. He added that an infectious disease institute needs to be established in Liberia as part of a medium and long-term strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Woods is well known internationally and has insisted that he will use every ounce of contact available to support efforts to eradicate the Ebola virus. He has also been meeting with various corporations, foundations and organizations to discuss the possibility of other assistance including small solar lights for young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that Atty. Woods studied in the Netherlands and lived two years in exile in that country. He is also a member of the International Advisory Board of CORDAID, Member of the Advisory Board of the Responsible Mining Index and now an Ambassador for Save the Children Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that while recently in the United States Attorney Woods also met with several organizations and individuals as part of his campaign to solicit assistance for the fight against Ebola as well as to build Liberia's healthcare infrastructure. He also met with several Liberian organizations and got the commitment of several organizations to supply funding and materials for the fight against Ebola and to help in rebuilding Liberia's broken healthcare infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Woods met with Dutch Parliamentarians prior to a recent debate on the Ebola Crisis in Liberia. Following parliamentary debate on Wednesday, October 8, the Ministry of Development has announced increased support to fight the Ebola Virus and the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The support will include ambulances, medical personnel, protective equipment etc. The City of The Hague is also planning an international conference to discuss more holistically the threat of Ebola socially, economically and politically with the view of developing a longer-term strategy for intervention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of the Stevedores Union, Mr. Lewis Dugbeh has lauded the management of APM Terminal for successfully making the Free Port of Monrovia free from the deadly Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia. He also thanked the Liberian government and NPA management for supporting APM Terminal management initiatives aimed at making the Freeport of Monrovia an Ebola Virus epidemic freed Zone in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trade Unionist said the cooperative efforts by the Managing Director of APM Terminal, Mr. Brain W. Fuggle and National Ports Authority (NPA) Boss Madame Matilda Parker were largely helping to keep vessels sailing to Liberia and everybody entering the Freeport saves from contacting the deadly Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lewis Dugbeh, President of the Stevedores (Casual Workers) section of the United Seamen Ports and General Workers Union of Liberia made the commendation when he addressed Casual workers forum last Friday nearer the Freeport of Monrovia on Bushrod Island in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dugbeh observed that since the outbreak of Ebola since last March, the Freeport of Monrovia has yet to produce a single case of Ebola virus, owing to the ongoing preventive Ebola response of APM Terminal management. According to him, the APM Terminal Management was enforcing all preventive health measures on all Freeport customers, visitors, Vessels' crew-members and workers including senior managers without any exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said management also encourages all Freeport workers wear long sleeve shirts and trousers under their personal protective equipment (PPE) and observe Ebola health advises from the Health Ministry, WHO and the American Center for Disease Control (CDC , among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the APM Terminal management instituted daily temperature checking and hand washing of all persons entering the Freeport of Monrovia. Mr. Dugbeh said APM Terminal management equally built a mini Ebola tent to help check suspected cases and instituted daily monitoring of all workers' activities and health status for possible Ebola symptoms during working hours, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dugbeh further averred that management also ensure that casual workers are covered by blanket insurance meaning that the insurance for individual institutions or shipping agency covers its casual workers assigned onboard their respective vessels or offices during working hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the workers are grateful to APM Terminal for striving to keep the Freeport of Monrovia opened and more functional amidst deadly Ebola Virus epidemic while other so-called investors and public officials fled the country for personal safety. He noted that the continuous functioning of the seaports amidst Deadly Ebola epidemic has largely helped to also prevent hunger and acute shortages of other basic commodities in the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">812 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several factors make confounded Liberians to suppose that the Ebola epidemic might be a curse from God for the nation's sins. But the head pastor and elder of the New Water in the Desert Assembly Church says that is not the case. In his view, God simply allowed it. The Analyst, reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Dr. Kortu K. Brown says God neither prevented Ebola from entering Liberia, nor act to stop its rapid spread because of the hardness of the hearts of the religious and secular leaders of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, noted that God was not finished with Liberia yet, that he would stop the epidemic but at his own time pace.Rev. Brown, who is the pastor of the New Water in the Desert Assembly and the General Overseer of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church in Liberia, made the observations in a statement climaxing a one-week &quot;Prayer through Praise Ebola Response Service&quot;, which he delivered on September October 5, 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the service, &quot;Be Still... God Did Not Bring Ebola To Liberia&quot;, is based on Psalm 46:10. The verse admonished believers to be still, knowing that God will make his powers manifest among unbelievers throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said those who were wondering why God did not stop the Ebola epidemic from entering the country and killing hundreds of hapless Liberians and residents should first ask themselves why God did not prevent the occurrence of several previous abominable acts perpetrated by the nation's secular and religious leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian foremost prelate said similar question about God stopping disaster in a Christian nation was asked when terrorists struck the US in 2001. He then recalled that in response to that question, a preacher's daughter retorted, &quot;God was there just as he was there when the Bible was thrown out of American schools&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By extension, he said just as God did not block the door when they were throwing the Bible outside, so did he not stop the enemy from walking into the same house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preacher daughter's retort is applicable to the Liberian situation today, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So here in Liberia, God was there when we took the Bible out of the schools. He didn't stop us. When we changed the name of the city from Christopolis to Monrovia, He did not stop us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we promote human rights over and above the moral code by encouraging the co-habilitation of a man to a man, a woman to a woman, God doesn't stop us. He's still there! When we become obstinate and employ the tactics of the &quot;Ahab's of Israel&quot; at all levels - community, district, county and national - to organize our own prophets for self-gratification and public relations purposes undermining Divine instruction, God is still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He doesn't stop us. When we meet in out secret places at night to plot against one another paying money to agents to bring other people's reputation into the mud, God is still there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was not all, according to the Pentecostal prelate. &quot;When pastors fight for supremacy instead of submitting to one another in the name of working of God, God is still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we fight in every way to oppress and suppress the genuine efforts of others to the extent of lying on them so that they are NOT credited or promoted above us, God still watches us - even when we are engaged in killing other human beings for political and economic powers. It's a matter of human choice and God is NOT always in the business of FILIBUSTERING man. Man is a free moral agent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the situation, he said God was a loving father who would not close his eyes to an epidemic of such proportion as sweeping the country and killing thousands of Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though God did not bring Ebola virus disease to Liberia, He will STOP it. He will do it in His own time. The process is on! No[ne] will get the glory. Any wonder why Thomas Eric Duncan will pass the airports in Liberia and the United States without anyone detecting he was an Ebola victim. But God knew. If He probably knew we will definitely give Him the glory, He probably would have opened our eyes to see,&quot; Dr. Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then encouraged all Liberians to continue to pray to their God. As they do so, he urged them to humble themselves, seek God's face, and turn from their wicked ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the backdrop of 1 John 1:8-9, he said rather than denying their iniquities, Liberians would receive God's forgivingness if they confess their sins thereby purifying themselves from their unrighteousness.&quot;God will heal, Liberia. Only He can! Man is just an instrument. DO NOT GIVE UP! OUR GOD IS O N THE THRONE! HE WILL VINDICATE US!&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued, &quot;Let's therefore follow the instructions to continuously wash our hands. Do not touch people suspected or diagnosed of Ebola or the bodies of people who died from the disease. Remember, Romans 13:1 requires that every soul is subject to the higher power... Listen to the authorities and listen to genuine spiritual instructions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clad head-to-toe in sealed plastic bioprotection suits, medics wheel a stricken patient into an NHS hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The space-age medical outfits - similar to those used in West Africa, where 4,000 people have already died from the disease - protect them from direct contact with the patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects, is present in all bodily fluids - including tears, sweat and mucus - of those infected.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, these photographs are not of a real outbreak of the disease in Britain - instead they show drills ordered by the Prime Minister amid growing fears that ebola could strike here ... and spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exercises come after the infection of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero, who caught the deadly bug treating two missionaries who had been repatriated for treatment in Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Romero is said to be gravely ill while another 16 people who she was in contact with are now being monitored for signs of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, said the UK should expect a handful' of ebola cases in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: The big problem is in West Africa where the doubling rate is every four weeks and it really is going up and up. So it will not be surprising if we have spill- over into this country. I would expect a handful of cases over the next few months.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by an ambulance crew equipped to deal with an ebola case, where he was put into an isolation unit. After blood samples were taken - and malaria ruled out - doctors decided to send some to the Porton Down laboratory in Wiltshire for testing. The victim' was then transferred 300 miles to the Royal Free Hospital in London - the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully ebola-proof' isolation unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another drill, an actress was put in isolation after telling staff at Hillingdon Hospital's urgent care centre in Middlesex that she felt fluey' having just returned from West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dame Sally said the exercises gave a very realistic test of how prepared the system is to deal with a case of ebola' while Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: I feel doubly reassured that we have robust plans in place.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health has refused to spell out exactly how many drills took place and where.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exercises were announced days in advance - but the Department of Health yesterday said key people' at the hospitals involved had been given only a few hours' notice that they would take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a small West African airline is to resume flights between London and Sierra Leone capital Freetown, amid continuing confusion about how passengers will be screened for the disease at Heathrow, Gatwick and the Eurostar train terminal at St Pancras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German-owned Gambia Bird said it was resuming flights for humanitarian reasons. However, a spokesman for Gatwick said bosses there were still no clearer about what ebola screening measures would be introduced, 48 hours after No?10 announced enhanced screening' would be put in place at Britain's two busiest airports and its main international rail terminal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebecca Harris and husband James, both 26, endured the agony of not knowing whether they had been exposed to the deadly virus, which has killed 3,000 in the latest epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were finally given the all-clear at 4pm yesterday when health officials confirmed that businessman Colin Jaffray, 58 - who was thought to be the first Briton to die from the disease - was not infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alarm was first raised after Mr Jaffray fell ill at the &pound;39-a-night Hotel Super 8 in the capital Skopje, where the Harrises were also staying. Mrs Harris, a bank worker from Hailsham, East Sussex, said: It was terrifying. Finding out that a guy had possibly died from ebola was just awful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had not had any direct contact with him - but wondered whether we might have touched the same stairway bannisters.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Harris added: The worst thing was that nobody told us what was going on. At first we didn't even want to venture out of our room to avoid the risk of catching anything. It has ruined our holiday because we have been stuck in the hotel when we wanted to be out sightseeing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is thought that Mr Jaffray, from Heydon, Cambridgeshire, died of natural causes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EUROPEAN stock markets tumbled again yesterday as fears deepened over the outlook for the global economy and the single currency bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 index fell 91.88 points to 6,339.97 in London - taking losses for the week to 3.1pc. It has now shed 8pc of its value since last month's peak of 6878.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sell-off was echoed in Europe with shares in Frankfurt down 2.4pc, Paris off 1.64pc and Milan 0.94pc lower on another bleak day for savers and investors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came as George Osborne warned that the global economy is at a critical' juncture with the eurozone heading towards crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are at a critical moment for the British economy and the world economy,' he said on the fringes of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. Serious clouds are gathering on the horizon.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to the deteriorating outlook for the global economy - the Fund this week cut forecasts for world growth from 3.4pc to 3.3pc for this year and 4pc to 3.8pc for next year - and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as the spread of the ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the biggest risk to the global economy at the moment and to the UK economy at the moment is the risk of the eurozone falling back into recession and into crisis,' the Chancellor added. We have seen growth forecasts cut back not just in Italy and France but also in Germany and unemployment remains over 11pc in the euro area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a weak position for these eurozone economies to weather further deterioration in their economic performance. The UK is not immune to these developments.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worries about the global economy also drove Brent crude oil down to as low as $88.40 a barrel, a level not seen for nearly four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock markets are getting battered again,' said Craig Erlam, market analyst at City trading firm Alpari. People have been talking for such a long time about when we will get a big correction in the markets but these figures suggest that they are under way and momentum is not slowing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It rounded off a dismal week for investors who have been spooked by warnings that the eurozone is heading for recession and a bout of Japan-style deflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook for the rest of the world has also deteriorated - although the IMF this week said the US and UK remain in good health. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said its investor confidence index is at the lowest level for two years. The last time it was this low, the FTSE 100 stood at 5,800.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Negative sentiment is rife in the market right now, and indeed if you look around the globe there is no shortage of troubles to worry about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eurozone is flirting with deflation. At the same time there are political tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the spreading ebola virus to concern investors.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is expected to be the fastest growing major economy in the developed world this year, expanding at more than twice the pace of Germany and eight times the pace of France. Official figures this week showed Germany, Europe's largest economy and the eurozone's engine of growth, suffered the biggest fall in exports and industrial production for more than five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German exports tumbled 5.8pc in August while industrial production was down 4pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Grievson, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, described the figures as disastrous' and warned that things may well get worse before they get better'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: Germany's ever-growing importance to aggregate eurozone growth indicates that things could get very messy in the bloc in the next few quarters.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS governments around the world announced more measures to curb the spread of the deadly ebola virus from Africa, travel-related stocks took flight on worries travellers will be put off going abroad because of the escalating outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holidays firm TUI Travel was a big blue-chip casualty, losing 13.1p at 343.8p, while cruise ship operator Carnival fell 61p to 2207p, and British Airways owner IAG shed 7.6p at 325.4p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drug makers also came under pressure as they struggle to find a cure, or at least something to prevent the spread of the virus, took a toll, with GlaxoSmithKline down 20p at 1375p.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although the sectors have been knocked by the ebola fear, one leading online broker said it had seen a 33pc increase in customers actively trading travel and pharma stocks as some investors take advantage of the drops in share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Hepworth, director Global Trading and Product at TD Direct Investing, said: This is not the first time investors have capitalised on the economic impact of a virus outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When swine flu hit in 2009 we saw trading by TD customers increase heavily as fears infected the stock markets.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City broker Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note earlier this week that it viewed the SARS pandemic in Asia during 2002-03 as the closest parallel to the potential impact from ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During November 2002 to March 2003, the broker noted, the global airlines sector fell by around 25pc as tourism in some regions dropped by 90pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Cantor added, the sector rebounded strongly in the following six months, bouncing about 50pc, helped by a strong recovery in the global economy. If the ebola case in Spain is a one-off and the virus is contained, the sector should rally sharply, in our view. Otherwise, expect a sharp but perhaps short-lived sell-off,' analysts at Cantor concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while a strong economy recovery helped the post-SARS bounce back in 2003, the current global growth outlook looks far from healthy, with worries about the impact from ebola and a struggling eurozone economy again taking their toll on stock markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a roller-coaster week, the FTSE 100 Index closed down 91.88 points at 6339.97 - another year's low - while the FTSE 250 index dropped 169.75 points to 14,641.58.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American blue chips were volatile in early trading, swinging higher than lower then higher again. A reversal by heavyweight mining stocks was a drag, with the sector having notched up gains in the previous session thanks to support from firmer metal prices after the dollar fell on Federal Reserve comment that US interest rates are unlikely to rise soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having been a strong riser then, Mexican silver miner Fresnillo lost 21p at 749p, while Anglo American shed 30.5p at 1325.5p, and Chilean copper miner Antofagasta was down 24.5p at 661.5p losing recent support from some broker upgrades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mid cap India-focused miner Vedanta Resources suffered as well after issuing a mixed production update for the second quarter, falling 71p to 852.5p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With crude prices weak again on fears of oversupply and falling demand, explorer Tullow Oil was the biggest blue-chip big loser, dropping nearly 8pc or 45p to 526p after the company said oil shows at the Sputnik-1 well on its part-owned Arouwe block offshore Gabon were non-commercial'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broker comment weighed on some blue chips too, with tobacco firm BAT down 53.5p to 3427p as broker Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating to sell from neutral in a review of the consumer staples sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grolsch brewer SABMiller fell 7.5p to 3290p despite Goldman reiterating its positive stance on the stock, still seen as a potential bid target for global peer AB InBev, in the same review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RSA Insurance was among the few FTSE 100 gainers, adding 2p at 465p with traders mentioning positive data on UK car insurance pricing from a Confused.com/Towers Watson survey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the small caps, cloud service provider Outsourcery jumped 3pc higher, up 0.5p to 17p on news Encore Capital subscribed for 5m new shares in the company at 20p each, giving it a 10.6pc holding.</SPAN></P>

Gamma's sale of around 44m shares raised about &pound;83m for selling shareholders making it the second-largest float of a UK telecoms firm since 2000 based on capital raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY AMANDA PLATELL</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1481 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE book has sold six million copies. The film has taken &pound;53 million at the box office. No wonder everyone is talking about Gone Girl not least because Gillian Flynn's thriller invites all married couples to assess just how well they truly know their other halves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flynn said the basis of the novel was her belief that marriage is one long con'. Herein lies the most chilling aspect of her story its casual demonising of husbands as ineffectual, unreliable, selfish oafs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has become a constant refrain in popular culture today. Whether in films, books, newspaper columns, TV shows or adverts . . . husbands are inevitably portrayed as irritating, inadequate, barely house-trained Neanderthals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they don't snore or leave their wet towel on the floor, they refuse to do their fair share of household chores. Like the husband in Gone Girl, they disappoint at every level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But do we ever stop to think how much we women might disappoint men in marriage? If we are honest, how often does he come last in our list of priorities behind the children, our parents, our careers, even our pets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much though we may moan, the vast majority of husbands I know work themselves to the bone, trying to do the best for their families in tough economic times. Is it any wonder young men are put off marriage altogether? The average age a man marries is now 37.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do women think constantly harping on about their men's shortcomings is conducive to a deep and fulfilling relationship? It's basic psychology that if you constantly tell a person they're worthless, they will act as if they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A particularly nasty side-effect of the feminist revolution is that in securing equality, too many women seem hell-bent on reducing men to second-class citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want men to play an equal part in parenting. Yet fathers rarely win custody of their children if a marriage falls apart, though they are inevitably forced to foot the bill to care for an ex-wife and family, even if it's the wife who has left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women should remember they are not perfect. So why do so many of us expect our men to be? Why denigrate the men we fell in love with?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing I am sure of. That if we take a Gone Girl view of marriage, the only thing likely to be gone is our husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A REAL ROLE MODEL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE girl who survived an assassination attempt by Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malala Yousafzai was targeted because she insisted on going to school even though it was prohibited by the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now living in Birmingham, she continues her tireless work of trying to secure education for other girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a contrast to Salma and Zahra Halane, who took their British education for granted and fled to Syria to become jihadist brides, forfeiting their freedom and embracing a life of ignorance and utter servitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there was a Nobel Prize for ingratitude, they surely deserve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTICE FORJULIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUMOURS abound that Julia Roberts is divorcing cameraman husband Danny Moder (pictured with the star), despite a year of couple's therapy'. She's said to object to him working on movies without her, as she's worried he'll be unfaithful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that when Moder met Julia (on a film set) he ditched his long-term partner to be with her, I'd say what goes around, comes around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOT A SEX CRIME... JUST VERY STUPID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUNGER Games star Jennifer Lawrence says she'd swap all her millions rather than have had to call her father and say her naked photos had been hacked. She insists the sharing of intimate images intended for an ex-boyfriend should be treated as a sex crime'. What is a crime against humanity is that we have to endure listening to these celebrities, who make their millions flaunting themselves, whining on about violation' having been stupid enough to pose for personal porn shots in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WESTMINSTER NOTICEBOARD...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">+ Miriam Clegg said in an interview she didn't want it all, she just wanted what men have. In her husband's case, that would be a job he doesn't deserve and the utter contempt of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">+ speaking of leaders' spouses, Mrs Farage has kept out of the public eye. The absence of the tokenistic political wife might be one of the best things yet to emerge from the Ukip bandwagon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">+ More must be done to support women in the workplace, says Theresa May. So why has she sacked her special adviser, the clever Fiona Cunningham, after an unseemly row with Michael Gove, and has only one very junior female minister in the Home Office?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">+ Before the by-elections, Boris Johnson described Ukip supporters as the kind of people who might engage in unusual practices with vacuum cleaners. In the end they sucked up Tory and Labour votes more efficiently than a Dyson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">+ A new poll says women MPs are more likely to have a drink problem and unhealthy lifestyle than men. Only 19 per cent of male MPs said they drank to excess proving they are liars or just too drunk to remember.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He misses her every day, he says, while promoting his new book Killers Of The King: The Men Who Dared To Execute Charles I. One can't help wonder if the book world's pandering to this less than distinguished author is simply a cynical ploy to keep him sweet until he agrees to dish the dirt on the only Charles he actually knew and could truly put the knife into.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DESPITE her polite smile, I can't imagine the Queen was purring' with pleasure when she awarded Hollywood star Angelina Jolie an honorary damehood for her campaign to end sexual violence in war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Jolie had said she would dedicate her working life to the cause. Her comments had echoes of the Queen's solemn act of dedication in 1947, aged 21 when she pledged: I declare that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN'S ebola screening plans remained in chaos yesterday as airports said they had been given no instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After days of Government indecision over whether to screen airline passengers to halt the spread of the deadly virus, Downing Street was yesterday still unable to say when the process would start or where it would find the medics to oversee it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it was feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the US said it would begin screening with temperature checks today, a Downing Street spokesman would only say that Britain's programme - consisting mainly of questionnaires - would start as soon as possible in the coming days'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night airports, airlines and Eurostar all said they were still waiting for instructions. Gatwick said it knew nothing about the new measures, with an airport spokesman adding: We've not had anything at all. We're still waiting for Public Health England.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health England, the Government body which had previously said screening would not be effective, is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work. Labour MP Keith Vaz said the lack of precise information was shambolic' and critics called the proposed questionnaires a complete waste of time'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Cameron said the Government was taking all the steps we can' to keep Britain safe from ebola but experts said the continued spread of the disease meant it was likely to arrive in this country soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN warned the number of cases is doubling every four weeks, with more than 4,000 people now dead in the worst ever outbreak of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street said screening will be introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick and the St Pancras Eurostar terminal for passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa - the three nations at the centre of the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be given a questionnaire about their potential exposure to ebola and their health. Those assessed to pose a risk will have their temperature checked to test for a fever. Any with a high temperature will be isolated while they undergo further tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics said a sufferer could show no symptoms on arrival in Britain but still fall ill days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said travellers would lie on questionnaires to avoid delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the proposed screening was a complete waste of time'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: Why would anyone admit they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration control?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he believed ebola would reach Britain, he said: I think it's bound to happen.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers arriving at Heathrow from Nigeria said their temperatures were taken in Abuja before they boarded, but there were no checks on arrival in Britain - or any warnings about symptoms or where to seek help if they fell ill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH businessman who may have been killed by the ebola virus in Macedonia was vomiting and shaking for two days before he died, his travelling companion revealed yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father-of-three Colin Jaffray, 58, travelled with business partner Michael English from the UK to the Balkan state to try to set up a fish farm business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials in Macedonia sparked an international panic in the aftermath of his death by claiming he was displaying some of the symptoms of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr English said last night it was crazy' to think his friend was suffering from ebola - because Mr Jaffray had not travelled to Africa for six years. Claims that his friend died as a result of drinking too much alcohol were also denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jaffray fell ill during his stay in the Hotel Super 8 in the capital Skopje. Although feverish, he was unaware he was suffering from internal bleeding, and refused to see a doctor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the third morning of being ill, he was taken to hospital from his hotel by ambulance suffering from severe stomach cramps. Within 90 minutes of arriving at the hospital on Thursday afternoon, he was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Mr English, 72, said: For two days he was saying he didn't feel very well. [The next] morning he said he felt better. We agreed to meet downstairs at the hotel at noon. He called and said he didn't feel good, his hands were shaking. He was confused.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair travelled to Macedonia on October 2, after enjoying a farewell dinner with their wives at Mr Jaffray's home in the upmarket Cambridgeshire village of Royston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Mr English's wife Olga said Mr Jaffray appeared healthy and jokey' the night before he left Britain. She suggested that Mr Jaffray may have suffered from an underlying medical condition linked to his nervous system, and revealed he had been admitted to hospital in Macedonia during previous business trips. She also denied he had a drink problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tests have yet to confirm his cause of death but Dr Jovanka Kostovska from the Macedonian Ministry of Health said that initial observations suggested it was not ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said none of the 25 guests and staff at the hotel or any medical staff had shown any symptoms. However, both the hotel and hospital remain under quarantine as a precaution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jaffray leaves behind a wife Dawn, 55, who runs a catering firm, a son and two daughters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A PASSENGER caused panic on a holiday jet when he joked he had ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man had been coughing and sneezing throughout the four-hour flight before shouting: I have ebola. You're all screwed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later said he was just kidding' but pilots on the US Airways flight from Philadelphia alerted health officials. Four officers in full biohazard suits and masks boarded the plane when it landed at Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobile phone videos showed the man being booed by his fellow passengers as he was taken off the jet, still protesting: I ain't from Africa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 255 passengers were quarantined for two hours while officials checked the man's travel history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabin crew had appealed to them to stay calm as the blue-suited experts boarded the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An air stewardess said: I need your attention. It's going to look worse than it is. I have done this for 36 years, I think the man who said this is an idiot. I want you to keep your wits about you. We have people coming on - we've all been watching the news - they look like they're in a bubble... This is all new territory for all of us.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biohazard team found the man and escorted him off the plane for medical checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alberto Smith, the airport's director of operations, said: It was a false alarm set off by a passenger who is slightly unbalanced. The passenger did it for attention and his passport does not show any recent trips to Africa.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline said: We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused, but the safety of our customers and employees is our first priority.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Passengers sparked panic and a full-scale alert because they feared an elderly woman who fell ill on a coach journey was suffering from ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman is thought to have flown to Britain from Africa before boarding a National Express service to Liverpool at Victoria station in London on Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver alerted the authorities when she became feverish on the journey and police closed the National Express station in Liverpool. Witnesses said paramedics in full body suits and protective masks boarding the coach as passengers fled in fear. The medics spent more than two hours treating the woman, who was also placed in protective clothing before she was taken to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors at Royal Liverpool University Hospital established the woman, who was in her 70s and had stroke-like' symptoms, did not have ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are closer to London than they are to Kenya, South Africa or Zambia. Yet the evolving Ebola outbreak in west Africa has already devastated travel to unaffected countries far away, cutting tourism to east and southern Africa by as much as 40 per cent. Industry experts are fearful of downplaying risks - the memory of John Gummer, Minister for Agriculture at the start of the &quot;mad cow&quot; BSE outbreak in 1990, feeding his daughter a hamburger in a much-derided attempt to allay public fears looms large.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following recent cases in the United States and Spain, more instances of people travelling from affected countries and becoming ill subsequently are inevitable. Despite the alarm such cases cause, secondary spread in countries with a good public health infrastructure has very limited potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Travel restrictions do not work. Research conclusively shows that even the most draconian travel restrictions have minimal impact on the spread of disease. In the particular case of Ebola, they could actually make things worse, hindering the movement of people and supplies that are essential to the response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Border screening measures make it appear as though something is being done, but are similarly wasteful, inconvenient and pointless. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, Canada used thermal imaging to scan 763,082 incoming travellers, but not a single one tested positive for SARS. An information sheet for arriving travellers, including clear instructions on when, where and how to seek medical attention, would be more valuable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, travel will continue. The important facts for travellers to keep in mind concern Ebola's method of spread, which is only by direct or indirect contact with blood or body fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contact with symptom-free people carries no risk as it is only symptomatic or unwell people who can spread infection. Ebola is not an airborne disease, and no virus has ever &quot;mutated&quot; to change its mode of transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Important precautions - regardless of Ebola - are careful attention to hygiene, especially frequent hand washing with soap and water or alcohol hand gel. (And, of course, avoiding blood, body fluids, or anything that might have come into contact with them.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with travel during the SARS and swine flu outbreaks, it is vital to reduce your risk of any fever during your travels, to avoid triggering unnecessary alarm. This means extra attention to malaria precautions and travel vaccines, and, in my view, being sure to have a flu jab before any kind of travel this winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's no room for complacency, and it is essential to follow the latest advice from the World Health Organization and UK public health authorities, but I have no plans to restrict my own travels at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There may well be some attractive bargains on offer in east and southern Africa this winter, and I see no current prospect of Ebola risk in the splendid isolation of a luxury safari or a beachside villa, thousands of miles from the heart of the crisis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is called ''S1'' by scientists. He was two years old, born in a bush village called Meliandou, a beaten-earth patch of ground hacked from the jungle at the far end of a footpath worming through the remnants of the once mighty Guinean Rainforest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The village is nothing more than a collection of mud-walled huts tasselled with leaf frond roofs. A ''rice larder&quot; protects the communal foodstore, a thatched chamber set high on bare lengths of timber, the bark stripped off to deter rats and other vermin that infest all human settlements hereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life in Meliandou is hard but ''S1'' could have been expected to play his part, growing up to work the rice fields in the annual cycle for survival, learning to cope with seasonal extremes when the Harmattan wind blows in fierce heat from the Sahara before cooling rains arrive around Easter in a tumultuous thundery climax. Or he might have left to try urban life in the sprawl of Conakry, his nation's capital, two days' rough road travel off to the west. Instead, he died last December, vomiting, feverous and passing blackened stool. His name was &Eacute;mile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is some debate as to when exactly he passed away. Some say the 6th of the month, some Boxing Day, but what is not debated is that he died from Ebola, the first fatality in an outbreak of the disease that is already the world's worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This status makes him ''S1'' or ''Serial 1'' in the eyes of epidemiologists who published a paper on the outbreak in the New England Journal of Medicine. In line with all other Ebola outbreaks the scientists did not have to look far for ''S2'', the boy's three-year-old sister who died a few days later, ''S3'', his mother, ''S4'', his grandmother, and so on as the viral infection sped through the community claiming the village nurse, ''S5'', and local midwife, ''S6'', who took the disease out of the village and to her own community. The spread had begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, so like other Ebola outbreaks. But the proximity to Meliandou of international borders - due south into Liberia, south west into Sierra Leone - and the nature of those countries - broken by war, hopelessly misgoverned and yet small enough to be covered by transport routes - has given this outbreak uniquely terrifying characteristics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is these that make it no exaggeration to say this current outbreak could lead to a health crisis of continental, even global proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have seen the first inklings of this with health workers in Spain struck down, a panic when a mortally infected Liberian man spent several days in America potentially infecting others. And this fear is going to breed like microbes in a petri dish until the special character of this outbreak is finally recognised and addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was 1976 when Ebola was first identified in that crucible for so much that is portentous about Africa, the Congo. Then known as Zaire, vials of blood from a sick Belgian nun were sent on ice in an old vacuum flask to a laboratory in Antwerp. One vial broke in transit creating a hazardous soup of melted ice, infected blood and glass shards but the skilled scientists safely recovered an intact vial and began their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What they found was new to science. It was a virus but by viral standards it was a whopper, much larger than normal viruses, but very long and very thin, like an unruly filament of hair. It was an example of a filovirus, a family of viral agents that are very dangerous to humans although this one, soon to be named after the Ebola river not far from the dying nun's mission station, appears to be primus inter pares in terms of lethality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fruit bats are suspected of being the natural ''reservoir'' for the Ebola virus, the animal having evolved to live with it in its system. Every so often - as happened in 1976 - the virus jumps into the human population, either when a person is bitten by an infected bat, or kills and butchers such a bat, or kills and butchers a deer or other animal recently infected by a bat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once inside a human the virus invades cells and replicates like fury, spewing out new copies of itself that use the blood system to spread around the body contaminating other cells. For reasons of safety, research into Ebola is far from complete, although it is known it has the ability to hijack the immune system, somehow making the body's defences turn on themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It hoodwinks blood into clotting where clotting is not needed, for example around the liver, and then it damages the lining of blood vessels to such an extent that infected blood cells, packed with replicated versions of the original virus, can smash their way through like wrecking balls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the body's clotting agents already used up, the tiniest breach in skin membrane leads to heavy bleeding, sometimes from the nose, fingernails or anus, a characteristic that has Ebola categorised as a haemorrhagic fever. Victims die from multiple organ failure as their blood pressure peters away to naught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Horrible though that is, the positive thing about Ebola from a public health point of view is that the virus has to date been difficult to spread. It has not been dispersed through the air, nor transferred by insect vectors such as mosquitoes, nor carried far in water. If a victim's infected body fluids are avoided by other humans, or neutralised using agents such as chlorine, the infection chain can be broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In crude terms that is what had happened since 1976 in the few dozen known eruptions of Ebola which have all happened in and around the Congo river basin. The spread of the disease has been stopped because either it has wiped out the entire human population, often small and in remote locations, or trained medical personnel, practising barrier nursing techniques, have treated patients safely until they have either died or recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just like generals who fight the last war, slow to adapt to a changing conflict situation, so world leaders have fallen into the same trap with the Meliandou outbreak. The attitude has been &quot;don't panic - a few doctors with biohazard gear will sort it out''. They could not have been more catastrophically wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now is not the time for fingerpointing about the inadequacies of the world's response. That must come later. Much more urgent is recognising how dangerously different this outbreak is and changing our response. For a start, this virus appears to be a new strain, cropping up 2,000 miles away from the only previously confirmed instances in the Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Never before has Ebola spread through a significant urban population yet this is what is happening in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone; Monrovia, capital of Liberia and Conakry, capital of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2009, I walked across Liberia and Guinea from the Sierra Leone border - the ''hot zone'' for the current outbreak - and I know from my own experience the poverty of the communities, how porous the frontiers are and how easy it is to reach the cities. I canoed across a river border away from official controls and saw how bush roads take taxi and bus traffic all the way to the big cities in a matter of hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I also know how hopelessly inadequate the governments of both countries are, letting down their sterling yet long-suffering people year after year, regime after regime. Outsiders suffer from an ''illusion of normalcy'' when applied to cities like Monrovia, the presumption being that it must have normal citylike characteristics. It does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has none of the basics taken for granted in the developed ''north'': clean water is not widely available, power is in short supply and public health is piecemeal, propped up mostly by hardworking outsiders such as aid workers or missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Freetown, where a cholera outbreak happened two years ago, the authorities in Monrovia have failed to improve squatter camps packed with impoverished people who have no option other than to use the sea in the city centre as their lavatory. Monrovians used to joke about what was found on the beach near the West Point slum. Few are laughing about it any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrival into these communities of a highly infectious pathogen like Ebola has meant it has reached a near-perfect site for mass replication and, more ominously, mutation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virologists have been able to establish that the HIV/Aids epidemic took off only after an original SIV virus jumped from primates to humans to create the forerunner of HIV. But to become a global epidemic the early HIV versions needed a large group of humans in which it could replicate, morph and develop. It found just such a population in the colonial capital of the Congo, L&eacute;opoldville, today's Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parallels with the current situation in West Africa are alarming, not alarmist: it is a place where tens of thousands of people live cheek by jowl, without decent public health infrastructure, walk the same muddy alleys, use the same open latrines, sleep in the same rooms as people who have already died of Ebola leaving infected traces of their bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are the realities behind the projected figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, America's leading public health body, which suggest 1.4 million people could be infected by Ebola within three months of today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are behind the astonishing warning from Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, issued this week that unless the outbreak is contained and stopped, ''the future of not only West Africa but perhaps even Africa is at stake''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even getting the message out there to people distrustful of central government is not easy. In Monrovia, there have been riots by mobs spooked at the sight of health workers dressed like spacemen taking away corpses dumped on the streets. Back over the border in Guinea, not far from Meliandou, seven members of a team monitoring the spread of the disease were beaten to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most worrying aspect is the longer the virus continues spreading in these communities, the greater the likelihood of a mutation that will create an even more pathogenic virus, one that might even be transferred through the air. This is not the stuff of a fiction writers, this is the sort of thing currently being talked about by virologists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sequence that began with &Eacute;mile has already passed Serial 3,800. World leaders need to wake up and fight today's war, not yesterday's, to stop that number growing exponentially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tim Butcher's account of trekking through Liberia, 'Chasing the Devil - On Foot Through Africa's Killing Fields', is published by Vintage</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 750 British troops are being sent to Sierra Leone to tackle the Ebola outbreak, along with hundreds of NHS volunteers who responded to an appeal from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that medical and military personnel would not be guaranteed repatriation if they developed Ebola while working on the relief effort.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they could be treated in field hospitals in Sierra Leone and would only be flown home on a &quot;case by case&quot; basis, the departments said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disclosure came as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans to introduce screening for Ebola at British airports descended into chaos, amid accusations that the Government's handling of the matter had been &quot;shambolic&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health experts criticised the scheme, with one saying the proposed screening was &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Macedonia admitted that it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that a British man said to have died of Ebola in the country actually had the disease;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation revealed that 4,033 people had died from Ebola. There are now 8,399 reported cases, an increase of 366 in just 48 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Cameron was yesterday forced to defend the Government's response to the Ebola crisis in the face of fierce criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this week, the Government had insisted screening at airports was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, on Thursday ministers said &quot;enhanced screening&quot; for the disease would be brought in at Gatwick and Heathrow airports and at the Eurostar terminal in London. But yesterday morning a spokesman for Gatwick said the airport had not been contacted about the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Mabey, a professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that in any event, screening for the disease was a &quot;complete waste of time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Firstly, there won't be anyone coming from these (West African) countries because all direct flights have been cancelled,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are they going to screen everyone from Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam? Secondly, why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cameron however, insisted the Government was simply responding to advice from health officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Quite rightly we are taking all the steps we can to keep our own people safe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain's deployment of 750 troops, three helicopters and a military vessel to support the relief effort is one of the biggest since the Libya campaign of 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, concerns were raised last night after it emerged that NHS workers and British soldiers may have to be treated in new centres in Sierra Leone if they contracted the virus. There were concerns that the care would not be at the standard they would receive in the UK. One British worker said: &quot;Infectious disease doctors volunteering say it feels like being asked 'to go over the top'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the Department of Health said that repatriation would occur on a case-by-case basis, and added: &quot;The welfare of our personnel is a top priority. The decision to treat in country or return to the UK will be determined in discussion with the MoD, Department of Health, Public Health England and the Foreign Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western governments have been disgracefully slow to wake up to the threat posed by West Africa's Ebola epidemic. Ebola was never an exclusively African problem; from the start, it was a global one. And it has always demanded an international response, not just for reasons of compassion, but also out of naked self-interest. It may seem insensitive to cite these wider interests in providing assistance given the scale of the tragedy on the ground, but if they help instruct a more effective approach, it can only be for the good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know from experience that pandemics will frequently have deeply negative economic consequences. This has actually got very little to do with the direct impact of the virus itself. Much more important is the effect on behaviour, the fear factor if you like, and the aversion response it triggers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already we are seeing the early signs in reduced international travel and cancelled trade, never mind the direct consequences for already fragile African economies. Shares in travel companies and airlines have taken big hits this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank quantifies these negative financial impacts at $32.6bn (&pound;20.2bn) for the immediately affected region alone, and that assumes containment by the end of the year. If containment is slower, the numbers are plainly going to be much bigger. And in a worst-case scenario, where the disease spreads more widely, taking in Western nations, we could be talking about a new global recession. One health expert here in Washington describes it as the worst threat to global health since Aids. It's hard to disagree. The outbreak has occurred at a point when the world economy is already looking vulnerable. It needs further shocks like a hole in the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The longer international action is delayed, the more expensive dealing with the epidemic becomes. This is one of those instances where relatively small amounts of investment in African health care and infrastructure could save the West incalculable costs further down the line. Rarely is the case for overseas aid made as strongly as this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the by, it has also given that almost forgotten institution, the World Bank, a new lease of life. Dr Jim Yong Kim, the bank's president, has been leading from the front here at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in mobilising the international response and providing some of the funds needed to contain the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The renewed sense of purpose Ebola has given the bank is perhaps just as well, for in other respects, Dr Kim finds his staff in open mutiny. The cause is a root and branch restructuring, including a substantial cost-cutting programme. It hardly needs saying that the troops, grown fat and complacent on their taxfree Washington salaries and perks, don't much like it. At a &quot;town hall&quot; meeting earlier this week, Dr Kim was confronted by one angry staffer with the complaint that cuts to the travel budget were forcing employees to fly at inconvenient times, thereby interfering with their &quot;breakfasts&quot;. Such hardship is apparently unknown at the World Bank - a curiosity, to put it mildly, for an institution committed to helping poorer nations with development. Whatever next? A ban on business class?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a world of plentiful finance, even for Third World countries, it has been increasingly hard to figure out the point of the World Bank, other than that of keeping its government-nominated placees in comfortable semi-retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kim is doing a good job at reinventing the bank for the modern age, but it's small thanks to his mollycoddled lifers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 750 British troops are being sent to Sierra Leone to tackle the Ebola outbreak, along with hundreds of NHS volunteers who responded to an appeal from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, both the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that medical and military personnel would not be guaranteed repatriation if they developed Ebola while working on the relief effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they may be treated in field hospitals in Sierra Leone and would be flown home only on a &quot;case by case&quot; basis, the departments said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disclosure came as:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans to introduce screening for Ebola at British airports descended into chaos, amid accusations that the Government's handling of the matter had been &quot;shambolic&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health experts criticised the scheme, with one saying the proposed screening was &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Macedonia admitted that it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that a British man said to have died of Ebola in the country actually had the disease;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation revealed that 4,033 people had died from Ebola. There are now 8,399 reported cases, an increase of 366 in just 48 hours. David Cameron was yesterday forced to defend the Government's response to the Ebola crisis in the face of fierce criticism. Earlier this week, the Government had insisted screening at airports was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global stock markets came under renewed pressure yesterday in a widespread sell-off prompted by fears of a global economic slowdown, tensions in the Middle East and the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After another volatile week, the FTSE 100 slumped to its worst level since 9 October last year, falling 91.88 points or 1.4% to 6,339.97. The index fell for the third week in succession for the first time since March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its recent peak of 6,878 in September, the FTSE has dropped around 8%, close to the 10% level which stock market analysts label as a correction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Germany's Dax dropped 2.4% yesterday to 8,788 and France's Cac closed 1.6% lower at 4,073.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 334 points or nearly 2% on Thursday, made an uncertain start and was down another 20 points by the time London closed. Emphasising the uncertainty facing US investors, the Vix volatility index jumped 8% to its highest level since December 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said European markets had been hit by US investors liquidating their holdings. He said: &quot;This week has seen the biggest weekly US outflow from European stocks in two months and total European assets held by US funds have dropped to $40bn (&pound;25bn) down from nearly $50bn in June, according to Lipper data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's market declines followed news that the International Monetary Fund had cut its global growth forecasts for 2014 to 3.3% from the 3.7% it was predicting in April. While it expects a pickup to 3.8% in 2015, it warned its predictions could still be too optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction figures yesterday emphasised the fragile state of the UK economy, with a sharp fall in new housebuilding in August sending output down 3.9% compared with July, the first fall for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK trade data showed the deficit falling from &pound;3.1bn in July to &pound;1.9bn in August, though mainly as a result of a substantial drop in imports from non-EU countries rather than the hoped-for surge in exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the outlook for China which has been preoccupying investors recently. Recent data raised fears of a slowdown in China, with a disappointing service sector survey this week adding more evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worries about the eurozone came to the fore this week after a poor set of industrial production figures from Germany was swiftly followed by news of a 5.8% fall in the country's exports, compared with expectations of a 4% decline. The fall was the biggest since January 2009, and showed the effects of the sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, as well as the wider slowdown in the eurozone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter, so a second consecutive contraction in GDP in the third quarter would tip it into a recession. There were reports that the government would next week lower its estimates for GDP growth to 1.2% for both 2014 and 2015, from 1.8% for this year and 2% for next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, added to the gloom on Thursday by saying in Washington that the eurozone recovery was running out of steam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are nervous that Draghi's plans to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy with a bond-buying programme have not been fully implemented and may not be sufficient. Other central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, have been gradually turning off the money taps which have been supporting the global markets for the past six years since the global crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of this support ending, and of interest rates rising, had already started to unsettle markets. There was a brief respite from the week's slide when the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggested it was in no rush to raise rates, but this proved short-lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that a case of Ebola had been confirmed in Spain added to the market pessimism. In two days, &pound;2bn was wiped off the value of leading UK airlines, travel agents and hotels before their shares stabilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that came the current geopolitical tensions, with air strikes on Isis, the Ukraine situation and the repercussions of the recent protests in Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of a global slowdown also hit oil prices. Brent crude fell more than 3% over the week, standing at just over $89 a barrel yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But gold, seen as a haven for investors in turbulent times, has added nearly 3% since Monday to $1,220 an ounce, its best weekly performance since June.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about a lack of training and safety standards have left some staff refusing to attend to possible Ebola cases at Madrid's Carlos III hospital, where the first known person to contract the disease outside west Africa is being treated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen people are in quarantine at the hospital, including four health workers who treated Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who contracted the virus after treating an Ebola patient repatriated from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven people, including two hairdressers who had given Romero a beauty treatment, entered the isolation unit on Thursday. None has tested positive for the disease except Romero, whose condition was described as serious but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making a surprise visit to the hospital yesterday, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, did not comment on allegations of substandard practices, but said a special commission had been set up to discuss measures aimed at preventing the disease from spreading in Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While no official numbers were available, Elvira Gonzalez of the SAE nurses' union, said fear of Ebola had caused some staff to refuse to treat certain patients, while others had resigned their posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One health worker told El Pais newspaper that many staff members were making excuses to avoid work. &quot;They are saying they've got their period, that they're getting dizzy, that they're claustrophobic . . . people get anxious and they can't work like that, being so nervous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others worry about being stigmatised. &quot;Their children aren't being invited to parties and their friends are cancelling joint holiday plans,&quot; Juan Jose Cano, a member of the Satse nursing union, told El Pais. &quot;They've become known as the Ebola nurses. And it's not fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital was not forcing staff to work, Gonzalez said. &quot;There are questions as to whether the protective suits are adequate, if the protocols are adequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff shortage has forced the hospital to seek help from unemployed health workers. One recent nursing graduate told El Pais she had delivered a CV to La Paz hospital in Madrid on Wednesday morning. Hours later, she received a call offering her work at the Carlos III hospital the next day. After discussing the job opportunity with her family, she turned down the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities have done little to dispel claims that the response to Ebola in Madrid has been improvised. In August, when the first missionary with the virus was repatriated from Liberia, the Carlos III hospital was emptied to attend to him. When the second missionary arrived last month, it was decided that only the sixth floor would be cleared.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posters aimed at raising awareness of Ebola are to be put up at larger British airports, according to internal advice sent out to all UK Border Force staff following the government's U-turn on screening for the disease on entry to the country .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just over a week to go before the first direct flight to the UK from West Africa for two months, the posters referred to in the Border Force memo - which the Guardian has seen - were among the few concrete details to emerge about the government's strategy, amid claims that screening is a waste of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A message marked &quot;sensitive&quot; sent out to staff by Marc Owen, the Border Force's acting chief operating officer, said that the large outbreak of Ebola in west Africa was &quot;understandably&quot; causing staff some concern regarding the risk from infected passengers, but reassured them that the threat was &quot;very low&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government planned to put up awareness posters at larger UK airports and ports to raise awareness of the disease among passengers arriving into the UK. The posters will advise them what symptoms they should look out for and what to do should they develop these symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message was accompanied by a Q&amp;A, with questions such as &quot;What should I do if someone collapses in front of me at control?&quot; and &quot;Should I use latex gloves?&quot; The answers were that it was highly unlikely someone ill enough to collapse would have been travelling in the first place, and that alcohol hand gel was more effective than latex gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister yesterday defended the decision to introduce enhanced screening at Heathrow and Gatwick, and at Eurostar terminals. &quot;What we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that's why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports,&quot; David Cameron said. According to Downing Street, the screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, contacts and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most travellers at airports are not expected to encounter the measures as they are intended to target arrivals from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the countries at the centre of the outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Labour MP Keith Vaz said a lack of precise information available about screening was &quot;shambolic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the screening a &quot;complete waste of time&quot;, adding: &quot;Why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration control?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also criticism from the World Health Organisation's director of strategy, Chris Dye, who said it was unlikely the scheme would detect anyone with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Griffin, chair of the government's advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, described the planned tests as &quot;a very, very blunt instrument&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, when I try to define a modern malaise, I find myself reaching for Larry David's deliciously dyspeptic series, Curb your Enthusiasm. In one especially grumpy (and therefore increasingly recognisable to me) episode, David donates money to a building and has a wing named after him. But his pride in his philanthropy is shattered when he learns that the other wing's donor has opted to remain anonymous and therefore looks more modest. But in fact, &quot;anonymous&quot; is David's friend Ted Danson, and everybody knows it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody told me I could be anonymous and tell people!&quot; Larry rages at his wife, Cheryl. &quot;I would have taken that option, OK? You're either anonymous or not. You can't have it both ways. It's fake philanthropy and it's faux anonymity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, I do not have a wing named after me, either openly or anonymously. I don't even have a teaspoon named after me. But among the many things I share with David is his confused irritation with the mores of modern philanthropy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I try to be a good person. I have been known to phone my parents occasionally and actually listen to what they say. And I no longer make faces at people on public transport behind their back (it's astonishing that the Nobel peace prize went to Malala instead of me).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's not pleasant when I realise that the thing that riles me more than anything else in my daily life is certain people's endeavours to raise money for charity. Yes, I'm talking about charity selfies - and, in particular, charity celebrity selfies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us recap the recent roster of celebrity selfie charity endeavours. Last spring, there was the #nomakeupselfie (gotta have a hashtag), which involved women - famous and &quot;civilians&quot;, to use Elizabeth Hurley's unforgettable phrase for the great unwashed - posting photos of themselves without makeup in the name of curing cancer. Because if there's one thing as scary as fighting cancer, it's showing the world what you look like without makeup. Beating cancer, one narcissistic hashtag at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next was the ubiquitously covered Ice Bucket Challenge, which my colleague Hannah Marriott so wisely described as &quot;a moving wet T-shirt competition&quot;. In this, everyone from Kate Moss to Tom Cruise chucked water over themselves (a notable number seemed to involve female celebrities in bikinis on the beach) to raise money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association and nominated fellow celebrities to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I coped with these initiatives. Which is to say, I gritted my teeth, acknowledged that they raised some money for charity, but otherwise ignored them because I don't give a fig what Holly Willoughby looks like without makeup or how Gisele looks beneath a bucket. Nor do I see what this kind of self-aggrandisement or celebrity mutual backslapping has to do with fighting illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's for charity - mustn't carp, right? But my God, it's so annoying! Charity! Annoying! Charity! Argh! Did I say &quot;I coped&quot;? I meant, my brain split in two. And now comes the #WakeUpCall selfie and I'm afraid I cannot hold my tongue any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This involves celebrities posting photos of themselves showing the world what they look like first thing in the morning so as to help the rest of us &quot;wake up&quot; to Syria (get it?). A photo of Jeremy Clarkson in bed first thing in the morning does not make me want to give to Unicef's Syria emergency appeal. It makes me want to rip out my eyes, reject the modern world, move to the Outer Hebrides and weave clothes out of brambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this really what we have come to - needing to see photos of luminaries such as Nicky Hilton and Elle Macpherson in bed in order to give money to Unicef? Since when did charity become some kind of beauty pageant in which famous women flaunt their &quot;natural&quot; looks? Although on that note, I must tip my hat to Naomi Campbell, who, judging from her charity selfie, wakes up every morning with a full face of makeup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, Campbell also told the New York Post this week that she is going to stage a celebrity fashion show (is there any other kind any more?) to raise money for the fight against Ebola. Campbell is concerned about Ebola, you see, because she has a house in Kenya and &quot;Ebola doesn't discriminate&quot;. That's right - Ebola, shockingly, doesn't recognise celebrities. Perhaps someone should show it Campbell's selfie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, this is all for charity, and that's great. But you can quibble with the means of raising money for charity without dissing charity itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So maybe someone, somewhere, could think of a way to give money that doesn't involve celebrities inflicting constant photos of themselves on the public? More &quot;let's help the Syrian people&quot; and less &quot;Syria - it's all about me!&quot;, perhaps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe, she says Larry Davidishly, people could just give to charity and not photograph themselves doing so. After all, the only negative feeling anyone should have about charity is guilt that they don't give more, not abject irritation with how their donations are being solicited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity celebrity selfie I would like to see is one in which Macpherson and Hilton point to a map and show they know where Syria is. Otherwise, I am driven to Davidesque rages. And don't even get me started on that wretched BBC God Only Knows song.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, having just watched the news, my sister tweeted, &quot;I don't mean to be alarmist or anything, but it's basically the end of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to see her point, especially now, when Ebola has had an especially busy week. On Monday it made what many saw as its inevitable landfall on continental Europe, then on Wednesday it claimed its first victim on American soil. It does feel a bit like we're living the script of an apocalyptic movie, as if somewhere in the background, that big, sonorous Hollywood voiceover is saying: in a world where an incurable disease rises to pandemic proportions, everyone is waiting like sitting ducks . . .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and Spain now have to roll up their sleeves, or perhaps roll them down with protective bee-keeping gear or space suits. Nigeria, on the other hand, is breathing a small sigh of relief. The most populous West African country has actually managed to contain the outbreak, having learned important lessons from its recent dealings with polio and cholera. No new case of Ebola has been reported in Nigeria since 31 August, and the US Centre for Disease Control has officially declared the nation Ebola-free. This is good news for Nigeria, and it is good news for me. Yesterday I sent off my application for a visa and for quite some time I have been looking forward to my first trip to West Africa - a trip I thought I might have to cancel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The green light notwithstanding, I still have the jitters, and so does my family. Resigned though my sister may be to the idea that it's the end of the world (she will go out, she says, reading Marvel comics) she still calls to beg that I wriggle my way out of the invitation. She gets my father to do the same - a family intervention of sorts. So my father calls from Jamaica warning that Caribbean islands are now putting in place strict policies limiting entry to anyone who has been to West Africa in the last 28 days. He is worried that I might disqualify myself from coming home for Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's nothing like a new outbreak to have countries fall back on old prejudices, fortifying their borders against diseases that will slip in nonetheless like the most cunning refugees. Just a month ago in Trinidad, a suspected Ebola victim was hauled off a plane and put into immediate quarantine. The reason for Trinidad's suspicion? He had a Nigerian last name. He was in fact flying to the Caribbean from London and hadn't been to West Africa in over five years. That's the problem - the way legitimate concerns can morph so quickly into something so much uglier, a scorn not of the disease but of the potentially diseased, the kinds of people we think might be infected. Just this Thursday in south London, a complete stranger shouted at me, &quot;Mate, do you have Ebola?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caribbean response is ironic, as the region itself is right now in the throes of one of its worst viral outbreaks - the mosquito-spread chikungunya virus. Chikungunya - a word so hard to fit into the mouth that the old linguistic process of folk etymology has transformed it in Jamaica to either &quot;chicken gunman&quot; or &quot;chicken gonorrhoea&quot;, things that sound decidedly more scary to catch or be shot by. It is by a similar process that the prickly plant known as cowage in England is rendered as &quot;cow itch&quot; in Jamaica. We seem to have a thing for pairing animals with forms of discomfort. Unfortunately, you don't need to be able to pronounce chikungunya in order to catch it. You only need to be bitten by a mosquito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikungunya is by no means fatal, and if you have it once, you don't need to worry that you will have it again. But the thing is brutal in its own way - laying its victims low for three days at least, and in severe case, for months. Young and old alike display all the symptoms of arthritic grannies while running high fevers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caribbean's response to chikungunya pales in comparison to Nigeria's effective response to Ebola. The Jamaican health minister, Dr Fenton Ferguson, has come under particular fire for his less-than-honest insistence that there were only 35 confirmed cases on the island. He was, of course, leaning heavily on that word, &quot;confirmed&quot;, in the way that unethical journalists lean on the word &quot;alleged&quot; to spread all kinds of misinformation. The true number of cases of chikungunya in Jamaica is far higher. But the health minister was concerned about old prejudices and borders, and the Caribbean's fragile tourist industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former colleague of mine - a biologist - was paid one of those courtesy calls from a rather high-ranking British official. She stood in line waiting dutifully for her hand to be shaken and to make the small chit-chat that accompanies such occasions. &quot;And what do you do?&quot; the official asked when she got to my friend, who responded that she was a malaria specialist. &quot;Oh my!&quot; exclaimed the official in an impressed sort of a way, and then, in a conspiratorial tone, &quot;isn't it just dreadful the diseases that are coming in since we've opened up our borders!&quot; That seems a little unfair to me, and ahistorical to boot, given the diseases that Europe once unleashed on the rest of the world; the unfortunate allergies, for instance, that aboriginal Caribbean people had to smallpox, and to bullets. But that's another story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be the end of the world, but these are indeed scary times with the rise and spread of Ebola, and the sharp-shooting chicken gunman or chicken gonorrhoea, and other diseases that surely wait around the corner. But from where I stand, what's just as scary are the old prejudices that rise and spread, and can be just as dangerous - just as fatal - as the worst disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global stock markets came under renewed pressure yesterday in a widespread sell-off prompted by fears of a global economic slowdown, tensions in the Middle East and the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After another volatile week, the FTSE 100 slumped to its worst level since 9 October last year, falling 91.88 points or 1.4% to 6,339.97. The index fell for the third week in succession for the first time since March. Since its recent peak of 6,878 in September, the FTSE has dropped about 8%, close to the 10% level which stock market analysts label as a correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Germany's Dax dropped 2.4% yesterday to 8,788 and France's Cac closed 1.6% lower at 4,073. After European markets had closed, Finland was stripped of its top-notch triple A rating and France warned it faced the risk of further downgrade to its AA rating. S&amp;P was the first of the major ratings agencies to cut Finland's prized rating because of its fear the country could suffer &quot;protracted stagnation&quot; and its exposure to Russia and the eurozone. Only Germany and Luxembourg remain triple A rating in the eurozone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 334 points or nearly 2% on Thursday, made an uncertain start and closed down 0.69%. Emphasising the uncertainty facing US investors, the Vix volatility index jumped 8% to its highest level since December 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said European markets had been hit by US investors liquidating their holdings. He said: &quot;This week has seen the biggest weekly US outflow from European stocks in two months and total European assets held by US funds have dropped to $40bn (&pound;25bn) down from nearly $50bn in June, according to Lipper data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's market declines followed news that the International Monetary Fund had cut its global growth forecasts for 2014 to 3.3% from the 3.7% it was predicting in April. While it expects a pickup to 3.8% in 2015, it warned its predictions could still be too optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction figures yesterday emphasised the fragile state of the UK economy, with a sharp fall in new housebuilding in August sending output down 3.9% compared with July, the first fall for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK trade data showed the deficit falling from &pound;3.1bn in July to &pound;1.9bn in August, though mainly as a result of a substantial drop in imports from non-EU countries rather than the hoped-for surge in exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the outlook for China which has been preoccupying investors recently. Recent data raised fears of a slowdown, with a disappointing service sector survey this week adding more evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worries about the eurozone came to the fore after poor industrial production figures from Germany were swiftly followed by news of a 5.8% fall in its exports, compared with expectations of a 4% decline - the biggest fall since January 2009. Germany's economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter, so a second consecutive contraction in GDP in the third quarter would tip it into recession. There were reports that the government would next week lower its estimates for GDP growth to 1.2% for both 2014 and 2015, from 1.8% for this year and 2% for next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, added to the gloom on Thursday by saying in Washington that the eurozone recovery was running out of steam. Analysts are nervous that Draghi's plans to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy with a bond-buying programme have not been fully implemented and may not be sufficient. Other central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, have been gradually turning off the money that has been supporting the global markets. The prospect of this support ending, and of interest rates rising, had already started to unsettle markets. There was a brief respite from the week's slide when the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggested it was in no rush to raise rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that a case of Ebola had been confirmed in Spain added to the market pessimism. In two days, &pound;2bn was wiped off the value of leading UK airlines, travel agents and hotels before their shares stabilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that came the current geopolitical tensions, with air strikes on Isis, the Ukraine situation and the repercussions of the recent protests in Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of a global slowdown also hit oil prices. Brent crude fell more than 3% over the week, standing at just over $89 a barrel yesterday. But gold has added nearly 3% since Monday to $1,220 an ounce, its best weekly performance since June.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about a lack of training and safety standards have left some staff refusing to attend to possible Ebola cases at Madrid's Carlos III hospital, where the first known person to contract the disease outside west Africa is being treated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen people are in quarantine at the hospital, including four health workers who treated Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who contracted the virus after treating an Ebola patient repatriated from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven people, including two hairdressers who had given Romero a beauty treatment, entered the isolation unit on Thursday. None has tested positive for the disease except Romero, whose condition was described as serious but stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making a surprise visit to the hospital yesterday, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, did not comment on allegations of substandard practices, but said a special commission had been set up to discuss measures to stop the disease spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of Rajoy's visit health workers gathered around his convoy, jeered and threw surgical gloves in protest at the government's handling of Romero's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elvira Gonzalez of the SAE nurses' union said fear of Ebola had caused some staff to refuse to treat certain patients, while others had resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One health worker told the newspaper El Pais that many staff were making excuses to avoid work. &quot;They are saying they've got their period, that they're getting dizzy . . . people get anxious and they can't work like that, being so nervous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others worry about being stigmatised. &quot;Their children aren't being invited to parties and their friends are cancelling joint holiday plans,&quot; Juan Jose Cano, a member of the Satse nursing union, told El Pais. &quot;They've become known as the Ebola nurses. And it's not fair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital was not forcing staff to work, Gonzalez said. &quot;There are questions as to whether the protective suits are adequate, if the protocols are adequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff shortage has forced the hospital to seek help from unemployed health workers. One recent nursing graduate told El Pais she had delivered a CV to La Paz hospital in Madrid on Wednesday morning. Hours later, she received a call offering her work at the Carlos III hospital the next day. After discussing the job opportunity with her family, she turned down the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities have done little to dispel claims that the response to Ebola in Madrid has been improvised. In August, when the first missionary with the virus was repatriated from Liberia, the Carlos III hospital was emptied for him. When the second missionary arrived last month, only the sixth floor was cleared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Posters aimed at raising awareness of Ebola are to be put up at larger British airports, according to internal advice sent out to all UK Border Force staff following the government's U-turn on screening for the disease on entry to the country .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just over a week to go before the first direct flight to the UK from West Africa for two months, the posters referred to in the Border Force memo - which the Guardian has seen - were among the few concrete details to emerge about the government's strategy, amid claims that screening is a waste of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A message marked &quot;sensitive&quot; sent out to staff by Marc Owen, the Border Force's acting chief operating officer, said that the large outbreak of Ebola in west Africa was &quot;understandably&quot; causing staff some concern regarding the risk from infected passengers, but reassured them that the threat was &quot;very low&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government planned to put up awareness posters at larger UK airports and ports to raise awareness of the disease among passengers arriving into the UK. The posters will advise them what symptoms they should look out for and what to do should they develop these symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message was accompanied by a Q&amp;A, with questions such as &quot;What should I do if someone collapses in front of me at control?&quot; and &quot;Should I use latex gloves?&quot; The answers were that it was highly unlikely someone ill enough to collapse would have been travelling in the first place, and that alcohol hand gel was more effective than latex gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister yesterday defended the decision to introduce enhanced screening at Heathrow and Gatwick, and at Eurostar terminals. &quot;What we do is listen to the medical advice and we act on that advice, and that's why we are introducing the screening processes at the appropriate ports and airports,&quot; David Cameron said. According to Downing Street, the screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, contacts and onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible medical assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most travellers at airports are not expected to encounter the measures as they are intended to target arrivals from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the countries at the centre of the outbreak, which has killed more than 4,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Labour MP Keith Vaz said a lack of precise information available about screening was &quot;shambolic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, called the screening a &quot;complete waste of time&quot;, adding: &quot;Why would anyone admit that they have been in contact with someone when they're in a hurry to get through immigration control?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also criticism from the World Health Organisation's director of strategy, Chris Dye, who said it was unlikely the scheme would detect anyone with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Griffin, chair of the government's advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, described the planned tests as &quot;a very, very blunt instrument&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, when I try to define a modern malaise, I find myself reaching for Larry David's deliciously dyspeptic series, Curb your Enthusiasm. In one especially grumpy (and therefore increasingly recognisable to me) episode, David donates money to a building and has a wing named after him. But his pride in his philanthropy is shattered when he learns that the other wing's donor has opted to remain anonymous and therefore looks more modest. But in fact, ianonymousi is David's friend Ted Danson, and everybody knows it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iNobody told me I could be anonymous and tell people!i Larry rages at his wife, Cheryl. iI would have taken that option, OK? You're either anonymous or not. You can't have it both ways. It's fake philanthropy and it's faux anonymity.i</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, I do not have a wing named after me, either openly or anonymously. I don't even have a teaspoon named after me. But among the many things I share with David is his confused irritation with the mores of modern philanthropy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I try to be a good person. I have been known to phone my parents occasionally and actually listen to what they say. And I no longer make faces at people on public transport behind their back (it's astonishing that the Nobel peace prize went to Malala instead of me).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's not pleasant when I realise that the thing that riles me more than anything else in my daily life is certain people's endeavours to raise money for charity. Yes, I'm talking about charity selfies n and, in particular, charity celebrity selfies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us recap the recent roster of celebrity selfie charity endeavours. Last spring, there was the #nomakeupselfie (gotta have a hashtag), which involved women n famous and iciviliansi, to use Elizabeth Hurley's unforgettable phrase for the great unwashed n posting photos of themselves without makeup in the name of curing cancer. Because if there's one thing as scary as fighting cancer, it's showing the world what you look like without makeup. Beating cancer, one narcissistic hashtag at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next was the ubiquitously covered Ice Bucket Challenge, which my colleague Hannah Marriott so wisely described as ia moving wet T-shirt competitioni. In this, everyone from Kate Moss to Tom Cruise chucked water over themselves (a notable number seemed to involve female celebrities in bikinis on the beach) to raise money for the Motor Neurone Disease Association and nominated fellow celebrities to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I coped with these initiatives. Which is to say, I gritted my teeth, acknowledged that they raised some money for charity, but otherwise ignored them because I don't give a fig what Holly Willoughby looks like without makeup or how Gisele looks beneath a bucket. Nor do I see what this kind of self-aggrandisement or celebrity mutual backslapping has to do with fighting illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's for charity n mustn't carp, right? But my God, it's so annoying! Charity! Annoying! Charity! Argh! Did I say iI copedi? I meant, my brain split in two. And now comes the #WakeUpCall selfie and I'm afraid I cannot hold my tongue any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This involves celebrities posting photos of themselves showing the world what they look like first thing in the morning so as to help the rest of us iwake upi to Syria (get it?). A photo of Jeremy Clarkson in bed first thing in the morning does not make me want to give to Unicef's Syria emergency appeal. It makes me want to rip out my eyes, reject the modern world, move to the Outer Hebrides and weave clothes out of brambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this really what we have come to n needing to see photos of luminaries such as Nicky Hilton and Elle Macpherson in bed in order to give money to Unicef? Since when did charity become some kind of beauty pageant in which famous women flaunt their inaturali looks? Although on that note, I must tip my hat to Naomi Campbell, who, judging from her charity selfie, wakes up every morning with a full face of makeup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, Campbell also told the New York Post this week that she is going to stage a celebrity fashion show (is there any other kind any more?) to raise money for the fight against Ebola. Campbell is concerned about Ebola, you see, because she has a house in Kenya and iEbola doesn't discriminatei. That's right n Ebola, shockingly, doesn't recognise celebrities. Perhaps someone should show it Campbell's selfie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, this is all for charity, and that's great. But you can quibble with the means of raising money for charity without dissing charity itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So maybe someone, somewhere, could think of a way to give money that doesn't involve celebrities inflicting constant photos of themselves on the public? More ilet's help the Syrian peoplei and less iSyria n it's all about me!i, perhaps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe, she says Larry Davidishly, people could just give to charity and not photograph themselves doing so. After all, the only negative feeling anyone should have about charity is guilt that they don't give more, not abject irritation with how their donations are being solicited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity celebrity selfie I would like to see is one in which Macpherson and Hilton point to a map and show they know where Syria is. Otherwise, I am driven to Davidesque rages. And don't even get me started on that wretched BBC God Only Knows song.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, having just watched the news, my sister tweeted, &quot;I don't mean to be alarmist or anything, but it's basically the end of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to see her point, especially now, when Ebola has had an especially busy week. On Monday it made what many saw as its inevitable landfall on continental Europe, then on Wednesday it claimed its first victim on American soil. It does feel a bit like we're living the script of an apocalyptic movie, as if somewhere in the background, that big, sonorous Hollywood voiceover is saying: in a world where an incurable disease rises to pandemic proportions, everyone is waiting like sitting ducks . . .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and Spain now have to roll up their sleeves, or perhaps roll them down with protective bee-keeping gear or space suits. Nigeria, on the other hand, is breathing a small sigh of relief. The most populous West African country has actually managed to contain the outbreak, having learned important lessons from its recent dealings with polio and cholera. No new case of Ebola has been reported in Nigeria since 31 August, and the US Centre for Disease Control has officially declared the nation Ebola-free. This is good news for Nigeria, and it is good news for me. Yesterday I sent off my application for a visa and for quite some time I have been looking forward to my first trip to West Africa - a trip I thought I might have to cancel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The green light notwithstanding, I still have the jitters, and so does my family. Resigned though my sister may be to the idea that it's the end of the world (she will go out, she says, reading Marvel comics) she still calls to beg that I wriggle my way out of the invitation. She gets my father to do the same - a family intervention of sorts. So my father calls from Jamaica warning that Caribbean islands are now putting in place strict policies limiting entry to anyone who has been to West Africa in the last 28 days. He is worried that I might disqualify myself from coming home for Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's nothing like a new outbreak to have countries fall back on old prejudices, fortifying their borders against diseases that will slip in nonetheless like the most cunning refugees. Just a month ago in Trinidad, a suspected Ebola victim was hauled off a plane and put into immediate quarantine. The reason for Trinidad's suspicion? He had a Nigerian last name. He was in fact flying to the Caribbean from London and hadn't been to West Africa in over five years. That's the problem - the way legitimate concerns can morph so quickly into something so much uglier, a scorn not of the disease but of the potentially diseased, the kinds of people we think might be infected. Just this Thursday in south London, a complete stranger shouted at me, &quot;Mate, do you have Ebola?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caribbean response is ironic, as the region itself is right now in the throes of one of its worst viral outbreaks - the mosquito-spread chikungunya virus. Chikungunya - a word so hard to fit into the mouth that the old linguistic process of folk etymology has transformed it in Jamaica to either &quot;chicken gunman&quot; or &quot;chicken gonorrhoea&quot;, things that sound decidedly more scary to catch or be shot by. It is by a similar process that the prickly plant known as cowage in England is rendered as &quot;cow itch&quot; in Jamaica. We seem to have a thing for pairing animals with forms of discomfort. Unfortunately, you don't need to be able to pronounce chikungunya in order to catch it. You only need to be bitten by a mosquito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikungunya is by no means fatal, and if you have it once, you don't need to worry that you will have it again. But the thing is brutal in its own way - laying its victims low for three days at least, and in severe case, for months. Young and old alike display all the symptoms of arthritic grannies while running high fevers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Caribbean's response to chikungunya pales in comparison to Nigeria's effective response to Ebola. The Jamaican health minister, Dr Fenton Ferguson, has come under particular fire for his less-than-honest insistence that there were only 35 confirmed cases on the island. He was, of course, leaning heavily on that word, &quot;confirmed&quot;, in the way that unethical journalists lean on the word &quot;alleged&quot; to spread all kinds of misinformation. The true number of cases of chikungunya in Jamaica is far higher. But the health minister was concerned about old prejudices and borders, and the Caribbean's fragile tourist industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former colleague of mine - a biologist - was paid one of those courtesy calls from a rather high-ranking British official. She stood in line waiting dutifully for her hand to be shaken and to make the small chit-chat that accompanies such occasions. &quot;And what do you do?&quot; the official asked when she got to my friend, who responded that she was a malaria specialist. &quot;Oh my!&quot; exclaimed the official in an impressed sort of a way, and then, in a conspiratorial tone, &quot;isn't it just dreadful the diseases that are coming in since we've opened up our borders!&quot; That seems a little unfair to me, and ahistorical to boot, given the diseases that Europe once unleashed on the rest of the world; the unfortunate allergies, for instance, that aboriginal Caribbean people had to smallpox, and to bullets. But that's another story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be the end of the world, but these are indeed scary times with the rise and spread of Ebola, and the sharp-shooting chicken gunman or chicken gonorrhoea, and other diseases that surely wait around the corner. But from where I stand, what's just as scary are the old prejudices that rise and spread, and can be just as dangerous - just as fatal - as the worst disease.</SPAN></P>

New Britain Palm Oil, the world's leading producer of sustainable palm oil, soared 283.5p or 73pc to 670p after receiving an all-cash offer worth &pound;1.1bn or 715p a share from Malaysian-listed Sime Darby, which is the world's top oil palm planter by land size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sime Darby's offer comes ten days after it decided not to proceed with an offer for Kulim Malaysia Bhd's controlling 49pc stake in the company.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquisition, which will give Sime Darby significant land holdings in Papua New Guinea comes when top palm oil producer Indonesia is looking to cap foreign ownership of plantations to 3pc from a current 95pc. New Britain Palm Oil has over 70,800 hectares of oil palm estates, a refinery and a bulking terminal in Papua New Guinea. As a brown-field asset, NBPOL will immediately contribute to earnings without risks associated with green-field expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 60 points higher at the outset in sympathy with the 274-point surge on Wall Street after the Fed expressed fears that a slowdown in global growth and a stronger dollar could affect the US as it maintained forward guidance and promised to keep US interest rates low for a considerable time', the Footsie succumbed to profit-taking to close 50.39 points lower at 6,431.85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealers were spooked by an early 140-point decline on the Street of Dreams following news that German exports slumped by 5.8pc in August, the biggest drop since January 2009, following data earlier this week that showed industrial orders and output suffered their steepest drops in more than five years.</SPAN></P>

African Barrick Gold added 6.7p at 207.2p. Mining giant Rio Tinto, which recently rejected a bid approach from Glencore, rose 64p to 3,053p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luxury goods group Burberry improved 26p to 1,492p after Deutsche Bank lifted its target price to &pound;16 from 1550p ahead of Tuesday's interims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite reporting only a 15pc rise in third-quarter production which was below some analysts' expectations, Centamin firmed 0.65p to 58.4p. However, the company was bullish about meeting its full-year target. After producing an estimated 93,624 ounces of gold in the quarter from its Sukari gold mine, it has unearthed around 250,000 ounces so far this year, leaving production of 170,000 in the fourth quarter to meet that target.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highly speculative Bahamas Petroleum gushed 0.12p or 3.3pc to 3.52p after a new legal framework for the Bahamas oil industry was announced. Oil services firm Cape jumped 19p to 284p following an upbeat Capital Markets Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broker Arden Partners upgraded to buy saying: Overall we were encouraged by the presentations that the company has a clear strategy going forward in terms of growing maintenance revenues partly via initially participating in construction contracts, and also the opportunity set to carry this out - particularly in the Middle East.'</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY BEN SPENCER, SAM MARSDEN AND DANIEL MARTIN</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1250 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MINISTERS were accused of a chaotic response to the ebola crisis last night after it emerged new screening measures amounted to little more than a questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street finally announced what tests would be put in place at UK borders for travellers from the three worst affected West African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The row came as ebola was feared to have claimed its first British fatality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man with a fever and internal bleeding died after he was taken to hospital in Macedonia. Last night the Government admitted the main new measure against the disease reaching Britain would be a basic passenger questionnaire - and not US-style temperature screening which has been proven effective in other outbreaks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics said passengers would simply lie on the questionnaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others accused the Government of sending out mixed messages and simply not doing enough to protect the public from a disease which is now thought to have claimed victims in Spain, America and Australia as well as in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a further sign of indecision, ministers appeared unsure of exactly when the screening would start, how many medical staff' would be needed to carry it out, or where they would come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street insisted ministers were simply adjusting policy in line with medical advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a day of escalating panic over the spread of the virus it emerged:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Hospitals are to carry out drills this weekend to ensure they are prepared to deal with infected patients - but some warned they did not have the equipment they needed,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?An African airline announced it would restart direct flights between Gatwick and Sierra Leone from next week, despite the dangers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?The scientist who first discovered ebola said it was inevitable that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">virus would spread to Britain,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Officials investigated whether the first case of ebola had arrived in Australia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?The condition of a Spanish nurse infected with the disease deteriorated as three medics who treated her were monitored, The top US health official said this has become the biggest health crisis since the emergence of Aids 30 years ago,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Sixty people were sealed inside a social services building in Paris during a false ebola scare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 58-year-old British victim, who has not been named, was admitted to hospital in Macedonia at 3pm local time yesterday but his condition deteriorated and he died several hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's health officials say his symptoms raised suspicions' that he was infected with ebola and samples have been sent to Germany for testing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If confirmed, it will be the first time that a UK national has died from the highly infectious virus. The man was said to have been unresponsive' by the time he reached the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his friend travelled to Skopje from Britain on October 2, and had been staying in the three-star Hotel Super 8, where rooms start at &pound;39 a night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have now quarantined the hotel in the capital Skopje where the man and a second Briton had been staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Jovanka Kostovska of the Macedonian health ministry's commission for infectious diseases, said the Briton had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are all symptoms of ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient,' she told a hastily-convened news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the man is not believed to have visited any of the West African countries affected by the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a day of political chaos over the disease in Britain, David Cameron ordered the screening start just hours after his own Defence Secretary insisted it would be pointless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A No 10 spokesman said: Enhanced screening will initially be implemented at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements as well as a possible medical assessment, conducted by trained medical personnel rather than Border Force staff.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U-turn came just hours after Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, insisted that screening would not be introduced, even after the US had announced it would start monitoring passengers at American airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a further damning indictment of the Government's chaotic response to the escalating crisis, health officials were still insisting last night that screening at UK borders would be ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just an hour before the announcement, Public Health England told the Mail: Screening is not an effective way to prevent the virus spreading.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals were last night bracing for ebola patients on British wards, with at least two planning to carry out dry runs' of infection scenarios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some hospitals warned they did not have the masks, goggles and gowns they needed to take even the most basic precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Rory Stewart, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence select committee, was among a number who questioned whether the screening programme would be effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that the programme omits most airports and does not include any sea ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Stewart told Channel 4 News: I'd like to see more British investment, more British troops, more British development workers in west Africa tackling this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts also warned that the monitoring announced by Downing Street would fail. Professor David Mabey from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said he believes questionnaires are a waste of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: I think people will lie. They don't want to be subjected to the inconvenience.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Creagh, Labour's transport spokesman, said: Our Government has been sending out mixed messages on screening, with ministers saying contradictory things and silence from the Department for Transport. The public deserves better.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: It is really important with an issue as serious as this that there is a consistent and clear message from government.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Tom Solomon, the University of Liverpool's head of infection and global health, said the announced measures offered little more than reassurance for a worried public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street said there had been no change in policy. A spokesman said they had the medical advice throughout and as that has changed, they have adapted their approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN WHITEHALL, THREE DAYS OF CONFUSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TUESDAY International Development Secretary Justine Greening says after news that a Spanish nurse had been diagnosed with ebola: It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK. The controls are there.' But Home Office Minister Norman Baker calls it a very concerning development' and said the case for screening at airports had to be examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEDNESDAY US says it will start screening at five major airports but Public Health England says: There are no plans to introduce entry screening for ebola in the UK.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YESTERDAY MORNING Defence Secretary Michael Fallon insists: The World Health Organisation advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure that people who are leaving are not infected'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yesterDAY LUNCHTIME George Osborne appears to give the opposite impression, saying: If the medical advice is we need to screen...then we will absolutely take that action.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yesterDAY AFTERNOON Public Health England appears confused by the Chancellor's suggestion, saying it stood by its decision not to screen but it added of its stance: We don't think that is going to change.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST NIGHT Downing Street announces enhanced screening arrangements' - extra questioning - at the UK's main ports for people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NURSE who volunteered to fight the ebola outbreak in Africa was last night waiting to learn if she had caught the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sue-Ellen Kovack developed a fever after returning home to Australia from a month-long stint with the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities said she had followed quarantine guidelines but local politician Bob Katter accused her and other aid workers of putting the nation at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: We honour these Australians for being self-sacrificing but compared to the risk they create for our country, it is not remotely comparable. One person's moral and humanitarian ambitions are being carried out at a very grave cost to Australia.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Kovack, 57, flew home to Cairns in Northern Australia on Tuesday. She had no symptoms during her journey and began a recommended home isolation' - a self-imposed quarantine which was supposed to last for 21 days, in line with Australian government policy. But yesterday she developed a low-grade fever' and checked herself into hospital for tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Sierra Leone, the nurse worked in makeshift field hospitals and treated ebola victims, including taking blood from an infected 11-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview before she left for Sierra Leone, Miss Kovack admitted she was nervous but insisted she wanted to help despite the risk of infection. She said: People put up their hands because they have an interest in their fellow man - that's why I'm going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I care about humanity and if I have what people need, I would like to use these skills. Why me? Well, if not me, then who?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, patients at a hospital where a Liberian diagnosed with ebola was treated are refusing to attend appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, died at the Texas Health hospital in Dallas on Wednesday after ten days of treatment, and staff said patients had failed to show up because of fear they would catch the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff's deputy Michael Monnig, who went into Mr Duncan's apartment without wearing protective gear, has been admitted to hospital after falling ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse who caught ebola in Spain was said to have deteriorated yesterday as three medics who treated her were monitored for the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Romero's brother, Jose Ramon, said her condition had deteriorated but that doctors were trying a different medication in a bid to fight the disease. She had been receiving injections of antibodies extracted from the blood of ebola virus survivors to help her immune system combat the infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Paris, a social services building was sealed off by health officials after an Ebola scare. About 60 people were effectively quarantined inside the building in the suburb of Cergy Pontoise, north-west of Paris, after four people from Guinea complained of severe headaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alert was called off last night after it was declared a false alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Prague hospital is testing a 56-year-old Czech man with ebola symptoms. The man had recently travelled in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DETAILS of the British ebola screening programme were revealed yesterday - but critics immediately dismissed it as not going far enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the US has announced it will test passengers with a thermal gun, the British response amounts to little more than a few questions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be introduced at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals for passengers travelling from the affected West African regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tests will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history and who they have been in contact with, as well as a possible medical assessment. Passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea will be identified by information passed from airlines and diverted into a separate queue at customs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a holding area, they will be asked how they are feeling, whether they have been in contact with ebola victims and if they have touched bush meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the medical staff are concerned, they will start a full assessment. But they will stop short of screening the temperatures of passengers using thermal guns, a procedure which will be adopted in the US this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thermal screening, which was first used during the Chinese SARS outbreak in 2002, picks out passengers who have an elevated temperature using an infrared temperature gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the affected countries, 36,000 people have been tested and 77 have been stopped from boarding flights since health tests were introduced two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were identified after temperature checks found they had a fever. Ultimately none of those stopped was diagnosed as having ebola. In many cases they were suffering from malaria, a disease rife in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts have warned that screening will not necessarily pick up ebola sufferers because the virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days before symptoms emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academics argue that the easiest and most efficient way of stopping the spread of highly infectious diseases is to screen people before they fly out of the affected area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Government has so far announced few specific details about how it will implement the new screening checks at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor David Mabey from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said questionnaires were a waste of time and that passengers would lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: If last week your aunt died of ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained and missing your holiday?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was prudent to carry out checks on passengers entering the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Targeted screening would help and if it discovers just one case it would make a huge difference,' he said. We don't want to be in the position where they are in Spain, where one case has caused so much distress.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, sounded a note of caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: Temperature screening proved very effective at controlling the SARS outbreak, because you can spot those people who have a fever when they are at their most infectious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With ebola, in a similar way, anyone who is infectious should be picked up. But in the incubation period of up to 21 days, when there are no symptoms and it is not infectious, it would not work and someone could slip through. My worry is that screening could engender a false sense of security.'</SPAN></P>

At each, an actor will pretend to be a patient struck down with the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday A&amp;E units across the country were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby, including masks, goggles and gowns. Yet staff at some hospitals say they haven't received the clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the drills, the patient' will turn up at a GP surgery or an A&amp;E unit with mock early symptoms including a fever, muscle ache and sickness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors are meant to ask have you travelled recently', and if the patient has been to countries such as Sierra Leone, Guinea or Liberia - immediately suspect they have ebola. Staff will put on protective clothing and the patient will be taken by ambulance to the hospital where the drill is taking place. Once they have been dropped off, the ambulance will be thoroughly decontaminated with a powerful chemical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff across the trust will be warned about the drill beforehand, but many may get only a few hours' notice - especially those working on other wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patients and relatives will also be informed that an exercise is under way - although they may not be told that it is an ebola drill', in case it creates panic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Health - which is overseeing the drills - will not to disclose which hospitals are involved, but they will most probably take place at one of four with specialist infectious disease departments: the Royal Free in North London, the Royal Liverpool, the Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the drill, officials will check that staff take all the appropriate steps to prevent the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health officials in the nearby area will also work out how best to alert members of the public who may have come into contact with the patient without causing mass panic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE Ebola fears continued to rattle travel-related stocks, shares in one of London's smaller companies jumped after traders picked up on its work combating the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andover-based Bioquell, a specialist in decontamination technology, surged 19&frac12;p, or 21.8pc, to 109p in trading volume that was far higher than normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dealers said the company had drawn attention because of its involvement in treating Ebola, which has caused the deaths of more than 3,400 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and has now spread to Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's Bioquell Pod product converts open wards into single-patient rooms and can be used to manage patients potentially infected with Ebola. Furthermore, its hydrogen peroxide vapour system decontaminates equipment and rooms used in the fight against the virus and has been put into action in France and Holland, as well as at the Royal Free Hospital in London, where an Ebola survivor, William Pooley, received treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, speculation that Bioquell will experience an increase in demand for its products pushed the shares to their highest close since May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More broadly, however, the virus remained a concern for investors amid worries it would hit demand for overseas travel. International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, fell 10.3p to 333p, holidays group TUI Travel lost 10.1p to 356.9p and easyJet closed 37p lower at &pound;13.41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The London market started the session brightly, buoyed by a surge in Wall Street overnight after the latest minutes from the US Federal Reserve suggested interest rates would not be lifted in coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brokers said retail investors used the morning rebound to sell out of positions in the wake of two days of falls in the FTSE 100, the FTSE 250 and the junior Aim market. Indeed, it was not long until the market turned once again. Another set of disappointing economic data from Germany knocked investor confidence and a warning from Chancellor George Osborne of the risks posed by the weakening eurozone economy gave another incentive to sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, the FTSE 100 relinquished its early gains to finish down 50.39 points, or 0.8pc, at 6,431.85 - its worst close for a year - the FTSE 250 lost 122.19 to 14,811.33 - a 0.8pc decline - and the FTSE Aim All-Share slid 0.7pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investors on Wall Street also took fright, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling to close more than 300 points lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale strategist Albert Edwards, a self-described &quot;uber bear&quot;, best summed up the mood by warning that fund managers are &quot;getting increasingly nervous that we have reached the end of the road and a major market top may be forming in equities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although equities generally were out of favour, gold surged as much as 2.2pc to $1,233 (&pound;765) an ounce on the dovish Fed minutes and stock sell-off, pushing shares in London-listed precious metals miners higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fresnillo climbed 46&frac12;p, or 6.4pc, to 770p and Randgold Resources gained 248p to &pound;42.98, a 6.1pc rise. An upgrade to &quot;overweight&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; by HSBC gave Randgold an additional lift, as did a move to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;add&quot; at Numis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egyptian gold miner Centamin advanced 0.65p to 58.4p, having pleased with third-quarter production results that stuck with a full-year output guidance of 420,000 ounces of the yellow metal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, corporate updates were a major driver of share prices yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recruiter Hays climbed 2.7p to 122.7p in the wake of an encouraging set of firstquarter numbers. John Wood Group, the oilfield services company, gained 13&frac12;p to 692p after confirming that it expects to meet forecasts for the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But N Brown, the home-shopping retailer, plunged 46.2, or 13.3pc, to 302p after rattling investors with a shock profit warning. Peel Hunt analyst John Stevenson noted that the company had only updated the market on September 16, but was now slashing its guidance for the second-half of the year. Given the short space of time, the analyst said he found the &quot;scale&quot; of the downgrades required &quot;difficult to justify in light of just three weeks further trading&quot;, and cut his recommendation from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;hold&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere among the retail shares, positive broker comment following a presentation to analysts a day earlier helped Dixons Carphone up 0.9p to 367p. &quot;Post-merger integration activities for Dixons Carphone are well under way and, if anything, are ahead of schedule with &pound;80m of synergies firmly underpinned,&quot; said the experts at Investec. The tie-up between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse completed in early August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vodafone slumped 6.95p to 197.35p after Nomura analysts warned that the telecoms giant faces growing competition in the UK, Netherlands and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports that the group may revive its bid interest in Italian broadband company Fastweb also hurt the shares, with Espirito Santo analysts saying they found &quot;some of the suggested multiples, in the eight times to 10 times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation] range, surprising for a business that generates next to no cash flow&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, Associated British Foods, the sugar-to-clothing-conglomerate, fell as much as 32p before closing down 12p at &pound;25.53 after it was hit by a warning from Germany's Suedzucker, the biggest sugar producer in Europe, that it was becoming harder to reach its target for annual operating profits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">594 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - In 1962, the last smallpox outbreak in Britain started at Bradford Children's Hospital. A number of children, staff and patients died. I nursed the little girl who had recently arrived from Pakistan and who died from smallpox (undiagnosed until post mortem examination).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Christmas and contact between child patients was unusually high because they were carried round the wards to look at Christmas trees and decorations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everyone in the hospital was immediately quarantined: nobody came in or went out. It was terrible to see the parents assembled for evening visiting (there was no unrestricted visiting then) but unable to see their own children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over a number of weeks, nobody in the hospital was allowed to leave. A ward was set aside in which those who had contracted smallpox were nursed. Supplies were left in boxes at the end of the drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no spread of smallpox into the community. One parent was admitted to St Luke's Hospital and died there, and a hospital cook died at the Bradford fever hospital. Our patients with smallpox were transferred there and we remained in quarantine until the prescribed period following the last patient contact had expired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak was controlled initially by quarantine, then by tracing contacts and vaccinating 285,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is it not possible to flag up those coming to Britain from areas badly affected by Ebola, even if they have come indirectly, and then to quarantine them for the duration of the incubation period? This is a heavy price for them to bear, but surely small in comparison to the potential price for us all. There was a vaccination available for smallpox; there isn't one for Ebola. Janet Reed Mirfield, West Yorkshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I recently flew from London via South Africa to Walvis Bay in Namibia. On disembarking, all passengers had to complete a form stating which countries they had visited. This was verified by checking passports. Before passengers entered the terminal, staff in protective clothing took everyone's temperature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday I flew via South Africa into London Heathrow. There was no sign of any health check on passengers. And we call Namibia a Third World country. Lucy Lester Wing, Buckinghamshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Keith Vaz (report, October 9) was right to call for immediate screening for Ebola, but this should be done in the affected West African countries. Waiting until possibly symptomless carriers arrive at British airports would be to take action far too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British Government and others should fund quarantine centres close to the airports of infected countries. Troops that have been sent recently should ensure that all who board planes heading for this country can prove they have been free from infection for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would restore public confidence and prevent sad situations like that of the nine-year-old boy from Sierra Leone, banned from a school in Stockport. Andrew Campbell Bristol</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - If I want to bring a dog into the country from outside Europe, it has to go into quarantine lest I import a disease. Up to now if I had come home from Sierra Leone, I could pretty much walk straight in. Kevin Wright Harlow, Essex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - We struggle to maintain a basic level of hygiene in British hospitals. The density of population in Sierra Leone is 32 persons per square mile. In the United Kingdom it is 106 persons per square mile. An Ebola outbreak would be catastrophic in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should stop travel to and from any infected country, and should certainly not be sending 700 military personnel to one. Andrew Green Northwich, Cheshire</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An African villager arrives home after a trip through the jungle, nursing an animal bite. A few days later, we see the same man, sweating and feverish, submitting himself to the care of local doctors. Gradually, the circle widens: the man's wife, his friends, the doctors themselves, all start to display symptoms. Cut to an international departure lounge, where a Western businessman or holidaymaker is knocking back paracetamol, sure that this nagging flu will have cleared up by the time he gets home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fear of pandemics is one that haunts our culture - and it is one that has been given new life by the events in West Africa, where the Ebola virus has claimed almost 4,000 lives. In keeping with the horror-movie narrative, the disease is starting to creep out of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, with cases reported in Spain and America. Yesterday saw the death of the first suspected British victim, in Macedonia, and the announcement by the Government that it is tightening screening procedures at airports. On Wednesday, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, warned that Ebola may become &quot;the next Aids&quot; - a killer not of thousands, but of millions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet those who have seen this movie before may also feel they know how it ends. When SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - appeared in Asia in 2002, we were told that it had a 25 per cent chance of killing &quot;tens of millions&quot;. There were calls for borders to be locked down, and new arrivals showing symptoms to be locked up. But despite a spike in sales of surgical masks, and the hurried cancellation of thousands of holidays to Hong Kong and Thailand, the disease ended up killing only 775 people worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a similar story in 2009 with swine flu. The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, warned that 65,000 Britons could die, and the government duly spent more than &pound;1.2 billion to prepare for the viral apocalypse. Yet while the disease was incredibly contagious, infecting millions worldwide, it turned out to be relatively mild. In Britain, only 457 people died - a significant number, but 25 times fewer than the 12,000 who are carried away by normal seasonal flu every year. To make matters worse, some experts later claimed that the &pound;424 million spent on stockpiling 40 million doses of Tamiflu had essentially been wasted: its average effect, they said, was to shorten the disease's duration from seven days to 6.3 (a finding which its manufacturer, Roche, disputed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the Ebola virus, too, there are reasons to believe that the impact in Britain will be relatively limited - which is why, to its credit, the Government appears to be resisting calls to panic. True, the virus is not only horrifically nasty, liquefying the internal organs of those who catch it, but devastatingly effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of those who catch it, the overwhelming majority will develop symptoms - and of those, most will die. There is as yet no cure, and no vaccine. In addition, the disease itself has an incubation period of 21 days: plenty of time for it to sneak into the country aboard a jumbo jet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola's strengths are, however, outweighed by its weaknesses. If you get it, you're in very big trouble, but the odds of that are quite small. It is not, unlike the pathogens of our worst nightmares, airborne: it is spread via infected bodily fluids, which have to enter the body via the eyes or mouth or a cut or wound. Moreover, it is quite fragile, meaning that it does not survive long outside of its host - and can be defeated by the simple act of washing one's hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the &quot;R0&quot; figure of the current outbreak - the technical term for the number of further victims that one sufferer can be expected to infect in turn - is somewhere around 2. That makes it a much slower spreader than Sars, smallpox or the strain of Spanish flu that killed tens of millions of people in the wake of the First World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this means we can be reasonably confident that Western health systems will contain any infection relatively easily. The disease has only escaped into the wild in Spain because of a series of avoidable errors: the nurse at the centre of the outbreak was apparently &quot;fobbed off with paracetamol&quot; when she tried to present herself; she was transported and treated by medics who weren't wearing protective gear; and even when the right hazard suits were procured, the sleeves turned out to be too short. If Spain's health system, or ours, were on a proper &quot;war footing&quot;, the chances are that we would be able to detect and quarantine patients quickly enough to prevent the disease spreading. The panic that would follow any wider outbreak would also do much of the authorities' work for them: the economy might take a knock as we all huddled at home, twitchily washing our hands, but the opportunities for infection would be limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Ebola is, above all, a disease of poverty - just like measles, which kills thousands in the developing world but hardly anyone in the West. It has struck Liberia and Sierra Leone so savagely because these states, and their health systems, were barely functioning to begin with. If the outbreak had begun even in say, Rwanda, it would have been halted relatively easily. As it is, containment has been hampered by chronic shortages of medical personnel; of facilities, equipment and medication; even of faith in the efficacy of Western medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was also, admittedly, a failure by the international community to take the outbreak seriously enough, quickly enough. The world, says Jim Kim, president of the World Bank, &quot;failed miserably&quot; in its response - at the cost of billions of dollars and thousands of lives. Now, belatedly, the international effort is grinding into gear. American troops are on the ground; Britain has despatched a hospital ship, RFA Argus, and is giving &pound;125 million to Sierra Leone to contain the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, the likelihood is that even if Ebola does become the new HIV/Aids, then it will, like HIV, be a blight on Africa rather than the world. But the West should still do everything in its power to stamp it out. First, for the obvious humanitarian reasons. Second, to prevent the region from becoming further impoverished and destabilised. And third, and perhaps most important, out of basic self-interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is that with Ebola, bird flu and swine flu and all the others, we have dodged a bullet. None of these pathogens is both deadly enough and contagious enough to wreak apocalyptic havoc. But the longer such viruses circulate, the more chance there is of one of them mutating in precisely such a fashion - of a strain of swine flu emerging that kills more than a fraction of its victims, or a variant of Ebola that can be transmitted by coughs and sneezes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To make matters worse, millions of people in both Africa and Asia are living in precisely the circumstances that make such a genetic leap more likely. Human agriculture and settlements are reaching into jungles and rainforests that may be rife with unknown contagions - such as Ebola itself, whose natural home is the fruit bat. Meanwhile, in crowded towns and villages, millions of people live cheek by jowl with animals, enabling diseases to be transferred between them. The H5N1 strain of avian flu, which has killed 375 of the 630 humans confirmed to have contracted it, first appeared in the Kanchanaburi province of Thailand: one of the first to die was Kaptan Boonmanuch, a six-year-old boy who carried a sick chicken home from his uncle's farm and died less than two weeks later, his lungs choked with fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Globalisation has made pandemics vastly more likely. Researchers in America have shown that the prevalence of flu precisely follows the volume of domestic air traffic, as infected people carry the disease from state to state. Worldwide, the number of passenger flights per year is expected to quintuple from the current three billion by 2050 - meaning billions more unsuspecting virus carriers. Global travel also gives diseases from different parts of the planet the chance to meet, mingle and mutate, potentially combining their deadliest traits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, however, our best defence against infection is the prosperity that globalisation brings - the prosperity that gives people proper sanitation and hygiene, in the form of clean beds, clean water and clean food. Economic progress also gives us the technological tools to track outbreaks via email chatter or early warning data. As for those of us in Britain, Ebola isn't the end of the world. But it's certainly a reminder of what a risky place it is, and how vigilant we need to remain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEDICAL staff in Madrid refused to treat possible Ebola patients yesterday for fear of becoming infected themselves, as the condition of the Spanish nurse who contracted the virus deteriorated further. The Carlos III hospital, where seven quarantined cases are being treated, has had to draft in extra staff after nurses there refused to turn up for shifts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are members of staff who are cancelling their contracts so that they don't have to enter [rooms with possible Ebola patients],&quot; said Elvira Gonzalez of the SAE nurses union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Formal absentee figures have not been released, but a number of nurses and health technicians have formally resigned from their posts while others have made excuses to avoid turning up. &quot;A lot of people are calling in sick,&quot; one member of staff told El Pais newspaper. &quot;They are saying they have period pains, or that they feel dizzy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staff members who have agreed to work in the hospital's isolation ward are receiving psychological counselling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reports come as Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, suffered multiple organ failure and was put on a ventilator. &quot;Her clinical situation has deteriorated,&quot; said a spokesman for the Carlos III hospital where Mrs Ramos, 44, was being treated, while her brother informed reporters that she had been intubated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't have great hopes for her,&quot; Jose Ramon Romero Ramos said in an interview with local television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, one of the doctors who treated Mrs Ramos when she was admitted to her local hospital in Alcorcon on Monday gave a damning account of the failure to isolate Mrs Ramos and protect health workers from infection in an open letter to health chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Juan Manuel Parra Ramirez said it was not until hours after he first requested &quot;immediate action&quot; to isolate her that she was finally transferred to the specialist unit equipped to deal with Ebola patients at Carlos III hospital. He also said the full protective suit he was issued with had left his bare skin exposed. &quot;At all times the sleeves were too short,&quot; he wrote, while quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madrid health chiefs have laid the blame for Mrs Ramos becoming infected on &quot;human error&quot; and insisted that procedures to avoid contagion remained intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Ramos herself has admitted that she most likely became infected after touching her face while removing the biohazard protection suit after visiting the infected missionary priest, Manuel Garcia Viejo, who died on September 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four people were put into quarantine on Thursday, bringing the total number of those in hospital, including the nurse's husband and several doctors who treated her, to seven. A further 84 people were being monitored in their homes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EBOLA may already have reached Britain, it was feared last night, after a businessman who had travelled to Macedonia was suspected of being the first Briton to die from the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macedonian officials said that the 56-year-old, who has not been named, had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding and that his condition had deteriorated rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These are all symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient,&quot; said Dr Jovanka Kostovska of the Macedonian health ministry's commission for infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second man who had travelled from London with the victim on Oct 2 has been isolated and the hotel they were staying at in the Macedonian capital of Skopje has been sealed off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Samples have been sent to Germany to confirm the cause of death. The disease has an incubation period of up to 21 days, which means the dead man could have been infected in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials said he had not travelled to any country caught up in the outbreak before arriving in Macedonia, but he may have been making his way to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before his death, the victim had been complaining of a severe stomach ache and had stayed in his hotel for three days. Around 3pm yesterday he was taken to hospital, but he died 90 minutes after arrival. The ambulance crew who took him to hospital has also been isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere in Europe, a Prague hospital said it was testing a 56-yearold Czech man with symptoms of the Ebola virus, while the health of an infected Spanish nurse deteriorated in Madrid, where eight people are in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday No10 announced that enhanced screening would be brought in at Heathrow and Gatwick and at Eurostar terminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government, which has up until now insisted additional checks were not necessary, changed its guidance following fresh advice from Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer. Under new guidelines, people travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be questioned about their travel arrangements and recent contacts. They may also face medical checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A No10 spokesman said: &quot;These measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that, given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100 per cent protection from non-symptomatic cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is important to remember that the overall risk to the public in the UK continues to be very low, and the UK has some of the best public health protection systems in the world, with well-developed and welltested systems for managing infectious diseases when they arise. Contingency planning is also under way including a national exercise and wider resilience training to ensure the UK is fully prepared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dame Sally said that &quot;further measures&quot; were necessary to protect the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In view of the concern about the growing number of cases, it is right to consider what further measures could be taken, to ensure that any potential cases arriving in the UK are identified as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We remain alert and prepared, should an Ebola case be identified here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However Britain is not yet following the lead of America and South Africa by bringing in temperature checks to detect passengers suffering from fevers. And experts warned that passengers were unlikely to be truthful if they had visited infected areas. Prof David Mabey, a doctor specialising in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said he believed that questionnaires asking passengers about their recent travel were a &quot;waste of time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;I think people will lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They don't want to be subjected to the inconvenience. Why would people tell the truth? &quot;If last week your aunt died of Ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained and missing your holiday?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Julian Hiscox, from the institute of infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, said public information was key to prevent the spread of Ebola. &quot;What we need to see is information handed to people as they step off planes and a phone number people can call if they start to develop symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The main thing is not to panic about this or to drive people coming to the UK underground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof Peter Piot, who was part of the team that identified Ebola in 1976, said that more European cases were &quot;unavoidable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Foreign Office last night said it was still working to confirm that the men in Macedonia were British.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, said there is no question that the West had been slow in its response to the Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Miliband, who is in Sierra Leone with the International Rescue Committee which he heads, called on the &quot;big guns&quot; of the world to lend more support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's no question that there's been a tardiness, a slowness, a lateness of response,&quot; he told Channel 4 news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Marc Sprenger, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said current models predicted between 500,000 and 1,500,000 cases in West Africa by the end of January if no action is taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that while official figures put the number of cases so far at around 8,000, in reality the collapse of West African health care meant the true scale was unknown and could be closer to 20,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told The Daily Telegraph that good exit screening from affected regions was a higher priority than entry screening at British airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;First of all you need to have exit screening. If exit screening is well done, and the flight is not that long, then in fact it's not necessary to have the person checked on arrival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while it may be simple to screen flights coming direct from West Africa, he said it would be far more difficult to track and screen connecting passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A Enhanced screening and its impact on travel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is enhanced screening?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers travelling from countries which are suffering the current Ebola outbreak will face extra screening when they enter Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where is it taking place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers travelling into the London airports of Heathrow and Gatwick, and travelling through Eurostar terminals may face enhanced screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will I be screened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have travelled from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea you will face more checks. If there is sufficient concern, medical staff will be on hand to carry out a health assessment. Border staff are also looking for passengers suffering from fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sore throat or rash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are airports considering temperature screening?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has decided that it is unnecessary and is unlikely to pick up many cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are people in the UK at risk from Ebola?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola can only be transmitted through contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person or animal. As such, the risk to the general UK population remains very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there a public health risk from a person with Ebola coming into the country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the crisis continues it is looking increasingly likely that we will see cases of Ebola imported into Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are on a flight with someone with Ebola what is the risk to you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You cannot catch Ebola through social contact or by travelling on a plane with someone who is infected, without direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA'S top health official has compared the outbreak of Ebola to the Aids epidemic amid dire warnings by international officials about the potential for the virus to spread.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a veteran of the fight against Aids, delivered his bleak assessment at a World Bank summit to raise funds to fight the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In my 30 years in public health, the only thing that has been like this is Aids,&quot; Dr Frieden told the conference in Washington. &quot;We have to work now so that this is not the world's next Aids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank president, struck a similarly sombre tone as he said that the global response to the Ebola crisis was &quot;way behind the curve&quot;, leaving Africa's future &quot;at stake&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The men were speaking at a summit also attended by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund managing director, international charity chiefs and leaders of the three worst affected West African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to quickly speed up, and scale up, the global response to this crisis,&quot; Mr Kim said. &quot;Unless we quickly contain and stop this epidemic, nothing less than the future of Africa is at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the impact of the crisis continued to spread, aircraft cleaning crews in New York walked out in protest at lack of training and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CDC experts have predicted that the virus could infect up to 1.4 million people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea by the end of January. &quot;It's going to be a long fight,&quot; said Dr Frieden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation has warned that the virus could be impossible to eradicate and become a part of life in West Africa.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEARS of a global Ebola outbreak spread yesterday as French officials sealed off a building with 60 people inside, an Australian nurse and Czech man were tested for the disease and aeroplane cleaners went on strike in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In France, police imposed a lockdown on a social services centre in a town near Paris after four people who arrived from Guinea this month fell ill with headaches and fever. Officials in Cergy-Pontoise, north-west of the capital, later said that the alert was a false alarm and nearly 60 others inside were allowed to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The panicked response of the authorities in France, which has not had any confirmed cases of Ebola, highlighted the scale of global concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were fears that the disease had reached the far side of the world after an Australian nurse who treated Ebola patients while working for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone developed a fever following her return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sue-Ellen Kovack, 56, was admitted to hospital in Cairns, Queensland, where doctors will receive the results of an Ebola test today. She felt healthy when she arrived home last weekend but still quarantined herself as a precaution, raising hopes that even if she had been infected, she will not have passed the virus to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the US, Ashoka Mukpo, a British-American photojournalist with NBC News who tested positive for Ebola in Liberia, continued to receive an experimental antiviral drug in hospital in Nebraska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Texas health officials said they did not believe that a deputy sheriff who was admitted to hospital after suffering possible Ebola symptoms was at risk of the disease. Sgt Michael Monnig had entered the Dallas apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died of Ebola in Texas this week. Doctors said Sgt Monnig was being treated out of an &quot;abundance of caution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe also experienced an Ebola scare when the main infectious disease hospital in Harare was closed following the admission of a Congolese student who was vomiting and bleeding. That case also turned out to be a false alarm after the young woman tested positive for malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Prague, a 56-year-old Czech man with Ebola symptoms was being tested for the virus yesterday. A spokesman for the Bulovka hospital said the man, who had recently travelled in Liberia, was in isolation and tests had been carried out and sent to a laboratory in Berlin. Results should be known today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In New York, about 200 cabin cleaners at LaGuardia Airport went on strike partly over fears about Ebola, saying they had not received proper equipment or training. &quot;The workers are really worried because they tend to be exposed to bodily fluids, including by cleaning out bathrooms on aeroplanes,&quot; said Amity Paye, a union spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US government will this weekend begin checks at five major airports of the temperatures and health histories of passengers who began their journeys in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 8,000 people in West Africa have been officially diagnosed with Ebola and the fatality rate is nearly 50 per cent. But the World Health Organisation believes that the true tally is much higher. Meanwhile, the first trial of an Ebola vaccine in Africa started in Mali with the vaccination of three health-care workers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some years ago my then boyfriend came home from a work trip to Sierra Leone complaining of feeling rundown. Hardly unexpected, since he'd been covering a war. But days later he was still moaning and snuffling, running a slight temperature. Halfway out the door and late for work, I admit I wasn't enormously sympathetic. The words &quot;man flu&quot; may have been used. He rang a few hours later, sounding only slightly reproachful, from the isolation unit for infectious diseases to which the office nurse - quite rightly alert to the possible implications of a fever acquired in west Africa - had dispatched him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I came to visit him at this strangely eerie outpost, with its posters on Ebola and Lassa fever stuck to the walls, they handed me a face mask. He spent several days in the care of some extremely impressive and kindly nurses before being diagnosed with a nasty dose of acute viral rhinitis. Otherwise known as the common cold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully that's probably as close as most of us in the developed world - apart from trained medics en route to Africa with the international relief effort - will ever come to dying of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That isolation unit in London has now moved to the Royal Free hospital, but what I saw there gives me confidence that if and when a case emerges on these shores (as opposed to a Briton infected overseas being repatriated for treatment), the NHS is well prepared to cope, both with the sick and with the inevitable tidal waves of worried well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Sierra Leone, we're blessed with modern hospitals that shouldn't buckle under the strain: we're not struggling to cope with only 120 doctors for every six million citizens. We're lucky enough to take for granted the existence of soap and running water in every home. We're not dealing with an airborne bug, like swine flu or Sars - the respiratory virus that caused brief worldwide panic in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola spreads by close contact with bodily fluids, so you can't catch it just from being on the same plane or train as someone with the virus. The anxious parents who forced the head of a Stockport school to cancel a visit from a charity worker and her son, both of whom live in Sierra Leone, needn't really have panicked. Yet the head said she was left with no choice, given what she called the &quot;misguided hysteria&quot;, adding that misinformation sweeping the playground rendered it &quot;not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience&quot;. Evidently they risked a hostile reception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's the problem. The single most reliable way for Britons now to avoid a gruesome early death remains to take up jogging and lay off the booze, not to close down Heathrow. Smoking is infinitely more likely than some exotic foreign virus to carry us off. But those public health messages lack the urgency and drama of Ebola; our familiar vices, deadly as they can eventually be, aren't the stuff of horror movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's something unique about a virus that triggers deep primitive fears of infection and contamination, and renders us hostile and suspicious of our fellow humans. There is an unpleasant edge to the reported mood in Dallas, where a Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola after spending days in the city has now died, with African-looking residents being asked why they don't &quot;get themselves quarantined&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Britain, meanwhile, the government has announced it is to screen travellers at major airports - even though the World Health Organisation says screening is best done on the way out of stricken countries, not on the way in anywhere else; even though the experts say screening wouldn't have caught Thomas Duncan, the man who died in Dallas; even though direct flights from the three affected countries have stopped, so you'd have to trawl through thousands of passengers from everywhere and anywhere, searching haystack after haystack of perfectly healthy people. Nobody wants to hear that modern life inevitably comes with a certain level of infectious risk, but the truth is that it does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 1970s at least 30 previously unknown infections have erupted around the world, and although none so far have lived up to doomsday billing, the fear in public health circles has long been that one day we could face the big one: a fullblown killer for the jet age, far more contagious than Ebola, taking advantage of an intimately interconnected world to spread at breakneck speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if we could somehow reverse globalisation overnight - close markets and borders, sever lifelines to the developing world, turn the clock back a century or so - that wouldn't necessarily save us from pandemics: the 500 million people infected by the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak are testament to that. But the price of our unprecedented freedom to work, travel and study wherever we like is undeniably that it's now easier for a nasty surprise to hitch a ride home, whether with an adventurous British holidaymaker or a sick outsider. The trick is not to panic about that but to prepare for it, equipping ourselves and others to cope - because while you can seal off a sick patient in a sterile bubble, it makes no sense to do the same to a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long after the west has forgotten about this particular outbreak, Africa may still be paying the price for it. People will die of wholly preventable diseases, because routine vaccinations couldn't be carried out amid the chaos. The World Bank reckons billions could be wiped off GDP in countries where economic growth means the difference between people going hungry or not; as its president said yesterday: &quot;Nothing less than the future of west Africa is at stake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses are folding because customers aren't venturing out, foreign workers are leaving and foreign investors are getting jumpy; children are missing school. Years of progress are now at risk, in countries only just emerging from ruinous civil wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you're going to fear something, fear that. If you want to agitate for something, make it the overseas aid budgets that fund everything from vaccine development and better literacy to basic medical care, clean water and modern farming methods - all the things that could help stop the next unknown virus, just waiting for its chance to jump a species barrier. Isolation of the infected may get us through this epidemic. But it is collaboration that will save us from the next one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travellers arriving at Heathrow and Gatwick from west Africa are to be screened for symptoms of Ebola, Downing Street announced last night after a day of confusion over the government's response to the virus that has claimed more than 3,800 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People travelling from the worst- affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - will face a questionnaire about their recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and their onward travel arrangements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical staff will be deployed to check some travellers' body temperatures to ascertain if they have fever, one of the early symptoms of the illness. Rail passengers arriving in Kent and London on the Eurostar from Paris and Brussels will also be screened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases have been reported in Spain and the US, where Thomas Eric Duncan died on Wednesday after flying in from Liberia with the disease. Washington announced that travellers from the worst-hit countries will have their temperatures taken on arrival at five major airports in New York, Washington, Chicago and Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK border measures will be introduced &quot;in the coming days&quot;, Downing Street said, and the announcement came despite the British defence secretary, Michael Fallon, saying earlier yesterday that airport screening was not in line with World Health Organisation advice which says that screening for fevers or temperature is better conducted in the exit country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, cited &quot;concern about the growing number of cases&quot; of the illness and recommended border checks to ensure &quot;potential cases arriving in the UK are identified as quickly as possible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health England staff will work alongside border officers. No 10 was unable to say whether the system would catch travellers from west Africa who had transferred planes in other cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent U-turn comes before a war-game-style test of Britain's ability to cope with an outbreak being planned by the Department of Health this weekend. Doctors, the ambulance service, local authorities and the police will take part in the real-time simulation of Ebola cases at two or more hospitals to be selected in the north and south of England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No 10 said: &quot;Advice from the chief medical officer today is that enhanced screening arrangements at the UK's main ports of entry for people travelling from the affected regions - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - will offer an additional level of protection to the UK. These measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Office was last night investigating reports that a Briton had died of suspected Ebola in Macedonia. Tests were being carried out, but the man's colleague said he had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A social services centre in Paris which was sealed off after four children recently arrived from Guinea showed symptoms of the illness, was later reopened after the French authorities said it was a false alarm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure for airport screening grew yesterday when Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, which scrutinises border controls, called for tests &quot;to ensure that this deadly disease cannot take more lives&quot;. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, also urged the government to consider passenger screening &quot;without delay&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davies said: &quot;Rapid access to healthcare services by someone infected with Ebola is key to reducing the risk of transmission to others. These measures could include a further UK-based package of measures to identify and assess the health status of passengers arriving from the affected countries and to ensure that those individuals know what to do should they be taken ill whilst in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say airport screening may have limited effect. David Heymann, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is also chairman of Public Health England, said there was a danger of creating a false sense of security .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not a failsafe method mainly because people cross (borders) while they are still in the incubation period and you don't know they are infected,&quot; he said. &quot;The most important response is better detection and rapid response. Borders cannot stop infectious diseases spreading. In Hong Kong and Singapore they set up thermal scanners during the Sars epidemic but I don't think they identified more than one case that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Griffin, chairman of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, said screening just for body temperature was ineffectual and would have missed the case of the US death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts also moved to play down fears of a major UK outbreak. Peter Piot, a Belgian microbiologist who is part of the World Health Organisation's Ebola science group, said: &quot;I'm not concerned about an outbreak in western Europe, in the UK, like we are seeing in west Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuts in government funding to the World Health Organisation contributed to critical delays in responding to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, which allowed the epidemic to spin out of control, disease experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK, US and other European governments reduced contributions to the organisation because of global austerity, and also failed to implement muchneeded structural reforms, they said. The WHO needs urgent reform, if future global health crises are to be avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first cases of Ebola occurred in December last year in Guinea, but it was not until late March that the ministry of health notified the WHO of what the Africa regional office described as &quot;a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola virus disease in forested areas of south-eastern Guinea&quot;. By that time, there had been 49 cases and 29 deaths.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took three months to confirm the outbreak because Guinea, having never had a case before, was totally unprepared. &quot;First of all, nobody expected Ebola to pop up in west Africa - you only find what you are looking for,&quot; said Prof Peter Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &quot;Then, health information systems in Guinea are extremely poor, as they are in Liberia and Sierra Leone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opportunity to clamp down hard on the disease in west Africa and bring it to a swift end was missed. By 23 March, when the official announcement was made, there were already suspected cases in the border areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, so three governments were involved and two of them were still emerging from the devastation of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO has a representative in every country, but the jobs often go to people with political connections. The directors of the Africa regional office, which needed to take the lead, are directly elected by the ministers of health in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What should be (the) WHO's strongest regional office because of the enormity of the health challenges, is actually the weakest technically, and full of political appointees,&quot; said Piot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEdecins Sans FrontiEres, whose volunteer doctors were quickly treating patients in Guinea, warned the WHO as early as 3 April that this outbreak was unprecedented and needed a strong response. &quot;First of all it was the first time we had a case in a big city like Conakry (capital of Guinea). It is something very different from the remote Congo jungle,&quot; said MSF's Brice de le Vingne, director of operations in Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases were also in a triangle where three countries met. &quot;We knew we were going to have a problem with dealing with three different administrations.&quot; No country was going to want to declare an Ebola epidemic, because of the economic implications. Yet the WHO's response was to say that the numbers were still small. &quot;Yes, in terms of numbers but not in terms of the different characteristics of this outbreak,&quot; said de le Vingne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF continued to sound the alarm, but the WHO decided to leave it to the African region - the numbers infected and dying continued to soar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 August the WHO director, Margaret Chan, finally declared Ebola an international public health emergency. There had been 1,711 cases and 932 deaths. &quot;Countries affected to date simply do not have the capacity to manage an outbreak of this size and complexity on their own,&quot; she said. She urged the international community to provide support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody now agrees this should have happened much earlier. &quot;They clearly underestimated the situation, partly because the African office dropped the ball, partly because member states, including the UK, cut (the) WHO's budget for emergencies and haemorrhagic fevers (as proposed by WHO management),&quot; said Piot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam agrees. &quot;Donors must take their share of the blame for the WHO's slow reaction to the crisis,&quot; said Mohga Kamal-Yanni, senior health and policy adviser. &quot;The cuts in funding to the WHO are in part responsible for serious cuts in essential functions, as illustrated by a lack of prompt surveillance and response to the Ebola outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WHO is pulled in different directions by different countries and the way its funding is structured makes that worse. There is core funding, agreed by the donor nations, but it has been slashed during the recent austere times. In 2011 its budget was cut by $1bn (&pound;620m). The budget set for the next two years was $3.96bn (&pound;2.45bn). The 2014-15 budget was set at the same figure - but it halved funding for health crises to $228m (&pound;141m).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&pound;141m: The portion of the WHO's 2014-2015 budget which has been set aside for dealing with health crises - half what it was two years ago &pound;141m</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund has changed its rules to allow the west African countries hit by the Ebola epidemic to borrow more and run up bigger deficits, as the head of the UN said 20 times more money was needed to fight the outbreak described as the biggest global health threat since Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said it was dropping its normal opposition to extra borrowing for the three worst-hit countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Lagarde said it was good to increase budget deficits at the current time, adding: &quot;We don't say that very often.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said the response to the outbreak that has left almost 4,000 dead had so far been inadequate. &quot;For those who have yet to pledge, I say please do so soon,&quot; he said. &quot;This is an unforgiving disease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appeal came as the presidents of the three countries said they could not cope with the crisis and pleaded with the international community to send more help their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's response had not kept pace with the spread of Ebola, said Sierra Leone's president, Ernst Bai Koroma, speaking by video to a summit held at the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, and describing the disease as &quot;a tragedy unforeseen in modern times&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told the meeting that Ebola was comparable to Aids. &quot;I have been in public health service for 30 years and the only thing I have seen like this is Aids. We will have to work hard to stop it being the next Aids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frieden's comments came as new suspected cases of Ebola emerged in Australia and Spain and as the chancellor, George Osborne, said Britain would test people coming into the country if advised to do so by medical experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alpha Conde, president of Guinea, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia, - also spoke at the World Bank-organised summit, which pledged money, health professionals and hospital beds to help deal with the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US sent two military planes to Liberia, which has cancelled elections in the latest attempt to stop the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conde said: &quot;This is an international threat and it deserves an international response. All of the West African region is threatened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Britain announced on Wednesday that it was scaling up its efforts to curb Ebola, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, called for other countries to do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we wait a month the task will be twice as large. It will kill twice as many people and have twice the impact on economies,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Kim, the World Bank president, said: &quot;We are still way, way behind the curve and we have to scale up the global response; there is a critical need for more trained health workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim also said that more hospitals and local health centres must be built quickly to ensure that west Africans had faith that they could get the care they needed in their own community, and no longer fear Ebola centres as places that people went only to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim, a doctor who formerly led the World Health Organisation's global Aids treatment programme, said studies of past disease outbreaks, such as the Sars virus, showed that 80-90% of the economic impact came from &quot;the fear factor that surrounds the outbreak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A World Bank study published on Wednesday said the cost of Ebola could be as high as $33bn (&pound;20bn) for west Africa if it could not be contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim said the most urgent humanitarian need was getting medical care to treat people in their own communities. That was also the best way to stop the spread of Ebola to other nations and counter the fear that magnified its economic damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trying to block your borders or isolate those countries in some way is not going to work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to help:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteer NHS staff wishing to be considered for the UK response to Ebola in west Africa can register their interest. More than 500 are already doing so at a Sierra Leone hospital. Medecins sans Frontieres is recruiting field staff, USAid is seeking qualified medical volunteers and the International Medical Corps is also recruiting for Ebola treatment units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donate Members of the Disasters Emergency Committee seeking support include: British Red Cross, Save the Children, ActionAid, Plan UK and Oxfam. Each organisation has different methods of accepting donations and different destinations for the funds, which are listed on their websites.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has suspended senatorial elections next week as the country grapples with an accelerating Ebola outbreak. At least two million voters, roughly half of the population, were due to elect half of the 30-member upper chamber next Tuesday, but organisers said a &quot;mass movement, deployment and gathering of people&quot; would endanger lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restricted numbers of polling staff and low voter turnout would make a credible election impossible, the election commission said. Its chairman, Jerome George Korkoya, said transporting and distributing ballot papers and polling kits had been hampered as international airlines had suspended flights since the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The timely delivery of these materials, most of which are sensitive, cannot be guaranteed in the wake of the current wave of the suspension of flights to Liberia,&quot; he said, adding that a new date would be set before the end of the year if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's popularity has taken a battering over her handling of the outbreak. Liberia has recorded 2,200 deaths, more than half of the 3,865 total so far. A presidential request for sweeping emergency powers led to one newspaper running the headline &quot;Flirting with dictatorship&quot; yesterday. Police used batons and whips to disperse about 100 protesters outside the national assembly as politicians debated the request to extend the president's powers beyond the state of emergency declared in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Johnson Sirleaf addressed an International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington along with her counterparts from Guinea and Sierra Leone. All three called for a greater international response to help stem the epidemic. &quot;Our people are dying,&quot; Sierra Leone's president, Ernest Bai Koroma, said by video link.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent surge of international aid is intended to provide the 2,000 beds that are urgently needed. But efforts to recruit medics have been complicated as many local health workers have succumbed to the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday a Ugandan doctor died at a treatment centre on the outskirts of the Liberian capital, Monrovia. He was the fourth doctor to die in the country since the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest number of infections in the past 21 days have come from Sierra Leone. At least 924 cases have been confirmed. The rise has been concentrated in the west of the country, including the capital, Freetown. Sierra Leone has 304 beds, which is well short of the 1,100 the World Health Organisation estimates it needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two burial teams in the western area went on strike this week over delayed payment. One worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: &quot;We're risking our lives and we're not being paid for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New cases have all but stopped in the eastern region bordering Guinea and Liberia, where the transmissions started and were initially highest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Miliband, the former foreign secretary, warned that the Ebola outbreak means that years of social and economic progress in Sierra Leone was at risk, as he visited the country's capital Freetown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miliband, who is now the head of the International Rescue Committee which has about 500 staff working in Liberia and Sierra Leone to combat Ebola, told the Guardian that this was a crucial moment and that treatment alone would not stop the death toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was in Freetown to thank and support the 330 staff there, he said, and to advocate for the people. &quot;After 10 years of pretty sustained progress, all that progress is now at stake,&quot; he told the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things that has become starkly clear to me in my visit is that there's no grey area here between controlling the disease on the one hand and widespread disaster on the other. We're at an absolute tipping point where either the disease is contained to the low tens of thousands, or it becomes an epidemic of a very serious kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miliband was speaking as anxiety in Britain mounted over the possibility that there could be cases in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he felt brave for flying into the outbreak region, he said: &quot;I don't think the leader of an NGO can call himself brave for going somewhere when 300 staff of his organisation are working here every day. If it's safe enough for my staff, it's safe enough for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no grounds for panic,&quot; he added. &quot;This is a hard disease to catch. It requires the exchange of body fluids. But there's no reason not to take sensible precautions.&quot; In west Africa, there were three steps to controlling Ebola, he said. The first was prompt identification of people who have the disease. Some who have symptoms will have other diseases instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is isolation and safe treatment for those who have the virus - safe for the health workers. One of the tragedies was that they had lost a higher proportion of health workers than civilians. The third, he said, is the quick and safe disposal of the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His organisation has been leading the nine-partner Ebola Response Consortium in Sierra Leone and supporting surveillance teams and working with community leaders. It will open a 100-bed treatment centre in Liberia in November. However, treatment alone is not the answer, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the things that I think is very important is that, although there's been a lot of international attention on the number of treatment beds, we will never catch up with the disease simply by focusing on treatment beds. The absolute key is to stop the chain of transmission, which means local engagement, house by house, community by community, street by street, explaining to local people what the dangers are and how they can mitigate them. That's an absolute priority if this disease is not to get out of control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the streets of Freetown Miliband said he had not seen dead bodies, adding: &quot;I have seen a lot of fear and a lot of resilience. This is a community that is going about its business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lost in Showbiz doesn't know about you, but it's barely slept a wink since the beginning of the Ebola crisis. There are so many different and terrible aspects of it that plague the mind: the thousands dead; the inadequacy of the response; the awful, helpless feeling that there really is no adequate response to an impossibly contagious virus with no effective cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one thought, more than any other, troubles Lost in Showbiz. Where are the celebrities in all this? It has long held that in any time of dire crisis, the people we should look to for guidance are the famous ones, selflessly willing to share with us their indispensable thoughts: on what should be done, on how people's spirits should be lifted. Where, it asks, is Paul Daniels, who gallantly came to Britain's aid during the 2011 riots with his own inimitable brand of blue-sky thinking, spitballing one idea after another that the nation may be saved further turmoil. Perhaps the rioters should be deported to Afghanistan, he mused. Perhaps we should douse them in petrol and threaten to set them on fire. Perhaps we should chop their hands off. Is there such a thing as a &quot;wide-angle tazer&quot; that could be deployed?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is Chris Brown, who felt the best way to quell the situation would be for him to play his hit song Beautiful People to the rioters? LiS mourns the loss of the late Michael Winner, who rushed to social media in the wake of the Japanese tsunami to focus the world's collective mind on the truly important issue: would it affect attendance figures for the American Cinematheque's Tribute to Michael Winner event at the Aero Theatre Santa Monica? And it asks, where is Nicole Scherzinger, who noted that the 2010 Haiti earthquake may have been bad news for the 316,000 people who died, but that at least there had been one &quot;miracle from Haiti's disaster&quot;: she'd met a producer at the recording of a charity single and together they'd made a &quot;raw, soulful and funky&quot; Nicole Scherzinger album.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were sage words; comforting words. But where are their equivalents in the face of the most severe public health emergency seen in modern times? The celebrity response started so well, with the appearance of Donald Trump - a man Lost in Showbiz has long come to think of as a lone voice of common sense in a world gone mad - fearlessly pinpointing the real culprits in all of this: the aid workers. &quot;The US cannot allow EBOLA infected people back,&quot; he tweeted. &quot;People that go to far-away places to help are great - but must suffer the consequences!&quot; At those words, Lost in Showbiz's heart skipped a beat: thank Christ, the cavalry are here! It can only be a matter of time before Daniels rocks up with his wide-angle taser and his jerrycan of BP unleaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LiS waited and it waited, but nothing. Its interest was momentarily pricked by a story that Kim Kardashian was &quot;trying to get her hands on a number of impermeable full body suits to protect herself and her family against Ebola&quot;. &quot;These are the sorts of suits companies such as Doctors Without Borders or airport paramedics would be requesting. Not celebrities who don't want to cut down their air travel,&quot; claimed Lost in Showbiz's old buddy An Unnamed Source. But the more it read of it - &quot;Kardashian, hubby Kanye West, and their daughter North were most recently in Paris, France, but there's no telling where the jet-setting family will end up next!&quot;, it concluded, with the implicit suggestion they might all be &quot;jet-setting&quot; to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia - the more Lost in Showbiz began to suspect that the whole thing was made up, perhaps on the famous journalistic principle that if you think up the most idiotic thing you possibly can about Kim and Kanye, there's a 75% chance it might actually happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, Lost in Showbiz became hugely excited about the story that R'n'B star Akon had played a charity concert in the Democratic Republic of the Congo encased in a giant plastic bubble to avoid coming into contact with the virus. It certainly seemed like the kind of thing Akon might do: he has variously told black Americans that they're &quot;blessed&quot; not to be living in Africa, then changed his mind and told them they should all move to Africa and &quot;live like kings&quot; there and informed one journalist that women should always be monogamous, but men shouldn't; and told another that there was no such thing as a blood diamond - the whole concept was apparently made up by Hollywood and people believed it. But, alas, no. He did indeed perform in a giant plastic bubble. Apparently he attempted to crowd surf in it but fell to the ground and had to be rescued by the UN - good to see them doing something useful for a change rather than just passing resolutions involving the trade in non-existent blood diamonds - but he also performed outside it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No giant plastic anti-Ebola bubble for Akon, no impermeable full-body suit for Kim: the only thing that celebrities appeared to have done in response to the Ebola outbreak was to film a sober video asking for a calm and non-hysterical response to the outbreak and soliciting donations for local relief efforts. Lost in Showbiz could barely contain its fury: a sober back-and-white video soliciting donations for local relief efforts? What's wrong with doing something genuinely useful, more befitting your status as celebrities? Will none of you get yourselves on Twitter and start pontificating about the situation like a great berk? Seriously, this amounts to an absolute dereliction of duty. These are desperate times! People are being forced to make up stories about Akon having a giant plastic anti-Ebola bubble, simply because so-called &quot;celebrities&quot; are refusing to behave like celebrities. It's absolutely terrible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So thank God for Katie Hopkins, who this week tweeted a load of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">idiotic old cack about how much she &quot;admired&quot; the Ebola virus. Teary with gratitude that at least someone is behaving in the manner they are supposed to, Lost in Showbiz is now counting down the days until Hopkins has herself deliberately infected with Ebola to prove that only thick, lazy poor people die of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lay person is forever wary of being &quot;blinded by science&quot;. But to students of disease, the laws governing the natural world look far simpler than the chaotically unpredictable reaction that their work can often provoke. Panics, manias and crashes attract the attention of economists. There is less systematic study of the way in which crowds react, and over-react, to information in the non-financial realm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rich world belatedly grapples with the singularly nasty, but reasonably well-understood, outbreak of Ebola in Africa, fear itself is becoming the primary problem in Europe and America. The pressing need of the victims, who are almost exclusively in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is plain. They don't require Live Aid-style charity donations but many more medical workers. So, too, do the far greater number of potential victims in the region, whose contact with the stricken will leave them prone to the frequently fatal virus until sufficient quarantined facilities are up and running. The contrast with Nigeria, which is also poor but has - through more organised care - contained Ebola thus far, illustrates the importance of both the volume and the coordination of personnel. But as anxiety in Britain rises to the point where a nine-year-old Sierra Leonean boy is banned from a Stockport school, despite the headteacher being satisfied that he is not infected, volunteers may be put off from venturing overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday saw a hasty refinement of the British approach. Initially, the UK had refused to follow America's lead and screen for raised temperatures at airports. The UK's immediate reservations were well-founded. Ebola's virology - non-airborne transmission, incubation of up to 21 days, early symptoms indistinct from many infections - puts a premium on rooting out the problem at source. Quickfire border checks cannot be relied on to keep the virus at bay in Europe if it becomes more entrenched in Africa. Then there are more specific objections to temperature scanners: the countless &quot;false positives&quot; with other fevers that would be picked up, and the even more damaging false reassurance that would be produced if the all-clear were given to genuine Ebola cases where symptoms were still dormant. Subsequently, however, Downing Street signalled that - at selected entry points only - the UK would be running questionnaires about where travellers had been, and what contact they'd had. Checks of this form could be more useful, but they are certainly not failsafe. Thomas Duncan, who died of the virus in Dallas this week, had falsely responded to such inquiries, denying he'd been in contact with anyone affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is one cardinal &quot;don't&quot; in navigating between the science of risk and public anxiety, it is running ahead of the available evidence about what it is, in fact, possible to guarantee. Recall John Selwyn Gummer feeding his daughter a beefburger to demonstrate that BSE posed no risk to humans to see why. What of the &quot;dos&quot;? Providing west Africa with the support it needs, including not only the troops already announced but medical practitioners too, is one. The overwhelming importance of on-the-ground resources vindicates David Cameron for, like Gordon Brown and Tony Blair before him, championing international aid. Like all the most important threats facing humanity, viruses are no respecter of borders, and so safety at home requires engagement and generosity overseas. At the same time as readying the NHS to deal with the worst possibility of Ebola's arrival and transmission within the UK, it is also important to calm popular fears, and more particularly the anxieties of those who might be considering joining the relief effort. David Miliband, now president of the International Rescue Committee, has shown the way. Simply by turning up in Freetown, he makes the point that this is not an infection that lays waste every passing visitor, but rather a disease spread through direct contact, whose progress can be controlled by careful hygiene drills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virulence of Ebola is not in doubt. No prescription to deal with it will do much good, unless honesty and calm are part of the mix.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's request for more emergency powers during the State of Emergency has ended in deadlock at the Liberian Senate while members of the House of Representatives have deferred their deliberation for a decision to today. The Liberian leader on August 7 informed the National Legislature of her constitutional mandate to declare a State of Emergency during which time certain fundamental rights will be suspended and or restricted given special circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 1, President Sirleaf reminded that august body of her declaration and recommended with request that certain restrictive measures were to be taken on keen Articles including the alteration of election time and manner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf reiterated her recommendation amidst public outcry that her request was vague regarding all the restrictions as the Constitution was clear and that there was no need for amendments but she provided clarity to the Legislature on the Articles of the Liberian Constitution she seeks to request restrictions in another communication dated October 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her communication, President Sirleaf among other things informed that body that if those measures outlined dare undertaken restricting and or suspending certain fundamental rights of the Liberian citizens and residents under the declared emergency which was accorded her by that Legislature, she would be able her sufficiently deal with the plague of the Ebola virus at all levels of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, serious controversy arose during the plenary sessions in the House of Representatives and the Liberian Senate surrounding attempts to endorse President Sirleaf's request for extra constitutional powers to handle the State of Emergency during the Ebola crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Senators in separate dispositions argued that the Liberian leader was trying to violate the Constitution by infringing on the rights of the Liberians and considered her request as one that would revert the country to the days of tyrannical leadership, imperial presidency and dictatorship while others believed that the President is not requesting an amendment of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators like Sando Johnson, Mabotu Nyenpan, Jewel Howard-Taylor, Geraldine Doe Sheriff, Nyonblee Karngar and Peter Coleman rallied their colleagues to stop any attempts to grant additional powers to the presidency because the issue of Ebola still remains uncertain and the powers exercised under the State of Emergency is already overwhelming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said it should have been health emergency instead of State of Emergency and look forward to November 6 when the State of Emergency period granted the presidency is to elapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators like Isaac Nyenabo, Abel Massaley, Frederick Cherue, Sumo Kupee, Joseph Nagbe and John Ballout detested the argument of their colleagues and said to reject the recommendation made by the President would be like contravening their own decision to have a State of Emergency declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They concurred that the request was more legal than political and urged their colleagues not to discuss it and reach a decision with emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Sirleaf wrote the Senate seeking its approval to restrict labor and assembly that might undermine the fight against Ebola virus or spread the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in her letter of clarity received by that body dated October 8, President Sirleaf said the Government of Liberia will use Article 15 of the Liberian Constitution to restrict freedom of press and prevent false information by print or electronic publication about the Ebola virus during the time of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communication among other things is recommending that government will use public facilities without payment and the government will also use towns, cities for burial sites during this State of Emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Representatives following the receipt of the President's communication on further clarity to her recommendation of restrictions to be placed on Articles 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17and 24, have agreed to hold a special session today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to journalists at the ELWA Hospital, CASE-Liberia Secretary General, Pailet Johnson said, &quot;It has been discovered that &quot;miracle drug&quot; selenium has contributed to many people walking out of the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) and CASE-Liberia being a consultant of civil society, citizens and amongst others&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S.G. Johnson added that he was told by Dr. Jerry Brown that they (doctors) are still studying the drug so that he cannot come out to say it is the cure but rather contributing to the release of many patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated, &quot;We want to encourage everyone that if we have more we will continue to do it with other resource partners that we have and network partners for CASE-Liberia. We will keep knocking on those doors and as we get them, we will bring them in and donate them to the hospital to assist in saving more lives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">S.G. Johnson said there are lots of humanitarians around the world and they know what is happening in the country. He said, &quot;Not to promise&quot; but when the avenues are created they will identify with hospitals to help stop the spread of the epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that their aim is to have zero transmission and zero infection and they will stand by that to ensure that their aim is accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded that those who contributed to the donation include Tohde Resource Center, Atty. Kofi Woods, and Leroy Jackson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1460 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday while en route to work I received telephone calls that President Sirleaf has written the national Legislature, seeking for approval to restrict certain constitutional provision, especially those under fundamental rights. One of the callers, specifically raised the issue that the President wants to curtail our freedom, as enshrined in the Liberian Constitution. Another who called said this is tantamount to &quot;military rule.&quot; One important issue pointed out also was that such request should have been made upon the declaration of the State of Emergency, and not nearly after nearly two months when she requested for the exercise for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her statement announcing the state of emergency on August 6, President, among other things said,&quot; therefore, and by the virtue of the power vested in me as President of the Republic of Liberia, I, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, and in keeping with Article 86(a) (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Liberia, hereby declare a State of Emergency throughout the Republic of Liberia effective as of August 6, 2014 for a period of 90 days. Under this State of Emergency, the Government will institute extraordinary measures, including, if need be, the suspension of certain rights and privileges.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, when I heard this, I found myself in a state of disbelief, as I could not imagine that I did not hear this very important communication sent to the Legislature, especially the House of Representatives, which is expected to debate the issue today during its plenary. Another thing that baffled me was that our newsroom missed such important news, only because of the issue of accreditation problem, since the proxy of our legislative reporter Alva Wolokolie, Winnie Saywah-Jimmy was denied coverage because she had not presented a letter from THE INQUIRER, introducing her as the proxy or replacement of Mr. Wolokollie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately upon reaching my office, I received a copy of the President's communication addressed to Speaker Alex Tyler. In that communication dated October 1, the President said, &quot;as follow up to my communications dated August 7, 2014 laying before you the fact and circumstances necessitating the declaration of the state or emergency, exercise of the emergency powers granted and in keeping with the need for emergency powers granted under Article 86-A and B which are imperative to contain the spread and bring an end to the Ebola epidemic please find below measure being undertaken restricting/suspending certain fundamental rights of Liberian citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.Article 1 of the Liberian constitution (1986). Alteration of Election Time and Manner; The President may, by proclamation, alter the period and manner provided for under the constitution of elections, by which the people cause their public servants to leave office or to fill the vacancies. Provided, however, that no deviation from the constitutionally prescribed period shall cause the extension or reduction of any term of office therein prescribed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.Article 12 of the Liberian Constitution (1986). Labor; The President may, by proclamation, procure certain labor or services during this state of emergency;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.Article 13 of the Liberian Constitution (1986). Free Movement. The President may, by proclamation, limit the movements of certain individuals, groups' communities as the case may be to prevent the further spread or contain the epidemic in certain areas.4.Article 14 of the Liberian Constitution (1986) religious restriction. The President may by proclamation, restrict certain religious practices generally or specifically, if she finds that such practice further endangers the public health and contribute to the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.Article 15 of the Liberian Constitution (1986) restriction on speech: the President may or by proclamation or executive action, prevent any citizen, groups of citizens or any entity protected under article 15 of the Constitution from making public statement in person, by print or electronic which may have the tendency of undermining the state of emergency, confusing the public on the nature of the health care threat or otherwise causing the state of panic about the health care or security condition of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.Article 17 of the Liberian Constitution (1986) Assembly; the president may or by proclamation limit the right to assembly for any reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 24 of the Liberian Constitution (1986) Appropriation of Property. &quot;The President may, or by proclamation, appropriate any private property or prevent the use thereof in order to protect the public health and safety during the state of emergency without payment of any kind or any further judicial process. Provided however that the property will be released to the rightful owners upon the end of state of emergency and the government pays any damages thereto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the President puts before the legislature many constitutional provisions she wants to be restricted during this time of the fight against Ebola, I take special interest on the portion her communication to the Legislature, as it relates to &quot;Restriction On Speech, in which it is said, 'the President may, by proclamation or executive action, prevent any citizen, groups of citizens or any entity protected under Article 15 of the constitution from making any public statement in person, by print or electronic which made have the tendency of undermining the State of Emergency, confusing the public on the nature of the health care threat, or otherwise causing the state of panic about the health care or security condition of the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I decided to raise the issue of freedom of the press and freedom of speech because any attempt to restrict these freedoms would be a fruitless exercise, something that can be likened to &quot;wasting water on duck's back.&quot; That is, any action or attempt to restrict these freedoms, in view of the level it has reached, would be vehemently rejected in all forms and manners. This country today enjoys unfettered freedom, for which it has been placed in countries of freedom of the press and freedom of speech. And so for the President to attempt to restrict this culture of freedom of the press and freedom of speech, is tantamount to stabbing herself in the leg because this one of the accomplishments, which her government can vaingloriously brag about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fear about such restrictions is that it usually leads to the creation of subterranean alternatives, which may not augur well for the country's democratic system. As it is locally said, &quot;water will always find its hole,&quot; therefore, should there be restriction on this, the people will still find other unorthodox or illegal means to communicate or air their views on issues relative to Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw this during the administration of the late Samuel K. Doe, when these freedoms were truncated under threat, the people resorted to other alternative means to communicate or air their views on issues of national concern. Don't ask me REACT, a newsletter that became a major source of information and critical views on national issues. Do we want another REACT or underground media group? I say a BIG NO! Therefore, the Legislature should take note of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howbeit, I should not be misconstrued as suggesting that in the exercise of this freedom, especially at this time of national crisis, people should be reckless and irresponsible in exercising these freedoms, to an extent of&quot;making any public statement in person, by print or electronic which made have the tendency of undermining the State of Emergency, confusing the public on the nature of the health care threat, or otherwise causing the state of panic about the health care or security condition of the nation.&quot; No! This is not the intent of this piece. My intention is to avoid any attempt to curtail or restrict the freedom being enjoyed today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, I am happy that there is a daily media interaction organized by the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism. This forum can also be used to set record straight on misleading information or Ebola or incorrect information on the disease. We saw this recently when a media institution reported that there was &quot;cure&quot; for Ebola. The EU in a press release rebuked and rubbished that and said that there has been no cure for Ebola. This is the kind of engagement I am talking about rather than restrictions on freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To conclude, let me say that the President is creating unnecessary headache for herself or unwarranted public debate on this issue because the level of freedom this country has reached is so unprecedented and, as such, remains irreversible. Whatever the situation, the ball is now in the court of the Legislature. I Rest My Case, with reservation to return should the need be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">764 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philips Corporation, an electronics manufacturing giant says it will soon roll out an improved diagnosis equipment for the quick detection of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ties Kroezen, Venture Manager of Philips Africa's Incubator, made the disclosure during a meeting with Atty. Samuel Kofi Woods, II, Human Rights Lawyer, in the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Ties Kroezen the new testing equipment which will take seconds to diagnose Ebola, will be rolled in out in a matter of weeks. &quot;It is expected that when this machine comes into use, it will take seconds to diagnose cases of Ebola, Kroezen told Woods. Philips now awaits approval from the WHO on this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods who recently concluded several high level meetings in the United States in search of aid for Liberia in the fight against the Ebola epidemic, as well as support to build Liberia's healthcare infrastructure has also met with Dutch Parliamentarians, Development Organizations and corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods said his mission is to muster consolidated programs to intervene in the current Ebola emergency as well as to advocate for a long-term plan and strategy to improve and upgrade Liberia's antiquated healthcare system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any further delay in delivering much needed logistics and supplies to Liberia will lead to the death of many more people and this is morally unacceptable. Liberia needs help, and it needs it urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a global tragedy. Send us medical help and everything else that would help us deal with this catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need medical practitioners, doctors, logisticians, ambulances, mobile clinics and we need help in building both institutional and human capacity in the medium and long term,&quot; &quot; says Samuel Kofi Woods, II, Liberia's Human Rights Lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods then emphasized the need for governments, international organizations and wealthy individuals to assist the struggling people of Liberia by providing more ambulances, mobile clinics, testing equipment and other assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended the international community for their commitment to assist but declared &quot;that it is too slow in arriving and the help might just be useless when it arrives&quot;. We need URGENT ACTION AND WE NEED IT NOW!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Woods has asked Save the Children Netherlands and other children's and relief organizations to develop and design programs to address the plight of children who have been orphaned by the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to officials of Save the Children- Netherlands, Woods emphasized the need to pay attention to kids who have become orphaned as a result of the Ebola Virus while implementing normal Ebola protection programs and building treatment centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These kids are victims and they stigmatized like other survivors. They need to be de-traumatized and de-stigmatized&quot; Woods noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods, who serves as an Ambassador of Save The Children -Netherlands on the group's campaign to educate the Dutch Public about the Ebola Virus and to solicit support from the Dutch public for the Ebola fight in West Africa, said he plans on developing a celebrity network to create awareness and increase international attention on eradicating the virus as well as emphasize the need to de-stigmatize it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Woods is well known internationally and has insisted that he will use every ounce of contact available to him in support of efforts to eradicate the Ebola virus. He has also been meeting with various corporations, foundations and organizations to discuss the possibility of other assistance including small solar lights for young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that Atty. Woods studied in the Netherland and lived two years in exile in that country. He is also member of the International Advisory Board of CORDAID, Member of the Advisory Board of the Responsible Mining Index and now an Ambassador for Save the Children Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be recalled that while recently in the United States also met with several organizations and individuals as part of his campaign to solicit assistance for the fight against Ebola as well as to build Liberia's healthcare infrastructure. He also met with several Liberian organizations and got the commitment of several organizations to supply funding and materials for the fight against Ebola and to help in rebuilding Liberia's broken healthcare infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Woods met with Dutch Parliamentarians prior to a recent debate on the Ebola Crisis in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the parliamentary debate on Wednesday, October 8, the Ministry of Development has announced that it will increase support and also announced the initial provision of 10 ambulances to Liberia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">535 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Liberia's locally based non-governmental institutions in the frontline against the deadly Ebola virus, Changing Lives International Ministries (CLIM), has launched its 3rd Round of distribution of Anti-Ebola materials in less privileged communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first round of distribution in early September 2014, CLIM executives disclosed that they have developed a work-plan that would reach out to over 150 under-privileged residents in the Duazon Community along the Robertfield Highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of their initial commitment, the institution has already visited two communities with the latest being the Paye Avenue Community where several women benefited from the distribution during the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLIM officials maintained that the Ebola Awareness and Preventive Messages remain consistent in keeping with the fight against the virus. They re-echoed their commitment in reaching out to more than 150 families especially women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a continual process. We will be reaching all out until there are encouraging messages of EBOLA leaving Liberia. We are not encouraged by the number of confirmed Ebola cases being reported by health workers but we are very hopeful that with the collective efforts of every Liberian the death toll will reduce and there will be more survivals,&quot; the CLIM officials added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presentation was made on Tuesday, October 8, in the Paye Avenue Community where dozen of women assembled to benefit from the gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberians and their international partners have intensified the fight against the deadly outbreak of the EBOLA virus which has already claimed the lives of over 2,000 persons in and around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the country experiencing the highest number of death cases since the outbreak of the epidemic, members of both local and international non-governmental institutions have solidified efforts aimed at curbing the unprecedented spread and its immediate reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing Lives International Ministries is a local and international NGO in the drive to buttress government's efforts and contribute to the process of nation building. Already, CLIM has constructed a 7-room building in the township of Duazon in the Royal Community. The building is intended to be used as an elementary school. The idea to erect an elementary school in that community was driven from a survey showing that hundreds of children who are of school-going age have less fortunate opportunity to acquire primary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presentation was headed by two of CLIM's executives, Martin L. Fleming and Rev. Boima Manson who used the occasion to urge members of the Paye Avenue Community to remain committed in the fight against the virus. They warned women of that community to follow all of the preventive measures put forward by the health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the materials, the women of the community pledged their commitment and promised to follow the health measures. They called on government to increase the awareness as there were some people who still doubt the existence of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, CLIM officials have extended special thanks to the Grace Lutheran Church Sturgis in Southern Diakoda, USA, who they said have been instrumental in making the materials available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">974 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, who recently traveled from West Africa to Dallas, had been in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas since Sept. 28. It wasn't immediately known what would happen to his body, which could remain contagious for several days. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for the remains to be immediately shrouded in plastic and double-bagged in leak-proof bags at the hospital, then promptly cremated or buried in an airtight casket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan's death comes four days after his condition was downgraded from serious to critical. Over the weekend, he had begun receiving brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral drug which recently gained emergency approval from the FDA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan, 42, is also the first person known to die of Ebola in the United States. The highly contagious virus has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa in 2014, the World Health Organization estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Americans who were diagnosed with Ebola in Africa have returned to the U.S. for treatment since late July. Aid workers Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol and Rick Sacra made full recoveries. WHO said one of its doctors was transported to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Sept. 9. No other details have been released. Ashoka Mukpo, a cameraman working for NBC News, arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha for treatment on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan's illness and treatment have sparked controversy. He arrived in Dallas on Sept. 20 from Liberia, one of the hardest-hit areas of the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His neighbors in Monrovia told reporters that five days before his flight, Duncan helped a pregnant woman get to the hospital in a taxi. She was convulsing and vomiting. The woman died at home hours later, after being turned away from a crowded Ebola treatment ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear if Duncan knew the woman had Ebola, but Liberian government officials said they plan to prosecute him for lying on health forms he completed at the airport on Sept. 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan answered &quot;no&quot; to questions about whether he had cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of someone who had died in an area affected by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CDC officials said Duncan, who was reportedly coming to Dallas to be with his fiancee, didn't have a fever or symptoms of Ebola when he boarded his flight in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days after arriving in Dallas, a friend drove Duncan to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian. Hospital officials said he showed up in the middle of the night with a fever of 100.1 degrees, abdominal pain for two days, a sharp headache and decreased urination. The hospital said Duncan told them he had not experienced nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea -- strong indicators of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal guidelines published in August state that someone in Duncan's condition and who was known to have been in West Africa should be placed in isolation and tested for Ebola. Instead, Duncan was given a prescription for antibiotics and sent home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital officials initially blamed a flawed records system for the mix-up but have since retracted that account. No other explanation has been given for how the Ebola diagnosis was overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan's condition had worsened by the time he was brought back to Texas Health Presbyterian two days after being discharged. He was reportedly throwing up as paramedics put him in the ambulance at the apartment complex where he had been living with family and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those paramedics are among seven health care workers who are now being monitored for Ebola symptoms. Three family members living in the apartment where Duncan stayed when he arrived in Dallas are being watched closely for signs of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional 38 individuals, including a man who was treated in the same ambulance after it was used to transport Duncan, are considered low-risk contacts, but they will be monitored for 21 days, the maximum period of time it may take for symptoms to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas Health Presbyterian immediately isolated Duncan upon his second arrival. According to the Dallas Morning News, the hospital may have violated federal guidelines by delaying a blood test for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, other testing and blood work was done first to rule out other causes. The Ebola test wasn't performed and confirmed until two days after Duncan was placed in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, called the mishandling a &quot;teachable moment&quot; and issued a nationwide alert to all hospitals updating them on how to appropriately respond to possible Ebola cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day before his death, civil rights leader, Rev. Jesse Jackson called on the public to show compassion to Mr. Duncan and his family, not to ostracize them, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the hospital initially discharged the patient because he was poor and did not have medical insurance. The hospital and health officials have said mistakes were made in handling Mr. Duncan, Reuters reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dallas officials have complained that the Ebola virus has cast a stigma over the Vickery Meadow neighborhood, where Mr. Duncan was staying, and neighbors are saying they feel discriminated against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dallas City Council member Jennifer Staubach Gates said she met with over 30 community leaders on Monday to try and assess the needs of the residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, they are feeling discriminated against,&quot; she told a local CBS affiliate. &quot;We still have some that have been turned away from jobs, some that have been turned away at retail locations. We're getting them in touch with legal aid and any resources necessary,&quot; Ms. Gates said and that she believes that educating the public is the only way to reverse the stigma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These residents, unless they happen to be one of those that were exposed that are being traced, they are not at risk for getting the disease and are not at risk for transmitting the diseases,&quot; she told the station.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamba Hali fled Liberia when it was in the midst of a bloody civil war. Now that the West African nation is at the center of a very different crisis -- an outbreak of Ebola -- the Chiefs linebacker is lending his support to a humanitarian relief effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hali joined officials from Heart to Heart International, based in suburban Kansas City, to announce Tuesday the construction of a clinic near the capital of Monrovia that will offer 70 beds for patients stricken by the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are dying,&quot; Hali said, &quot;and they're dying at a rapid rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has been among the hardest hit nations at the center of the long outbreak, which has killed more than 3,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The medical system is overwhelmed by the Ebola epidemic, and every doctor and health official said the biggest need is more Ebola treatment units,&quot; said Heart to Heart founder Dr. Gary Morsch. &quot;The world must respond -- and urgently -- to get control of this outbreak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Friday, there had been 3,834 confirmed Ebola cases and 2,069 deaths in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. Forty-four percent of those cases were reported in the past three weeks, a signal that the infectious disease is spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberians are smart people, strident people. It was a beautiful country at one point, when I was very young,&quot; Hali said. &quot;These are good people, God-fearing people, but this is a third-world country. They need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hali, who fled with his father from Liberia at the age of 10, became an American citizen a few years ago. But he still has family members in Monrovia, on the Pacific coast, and Lofa County, which is along the northern border with Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been fortunate,&quot; Hali said. &quot;My family that's there hasn't contracted Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heart to Heart has been responding to health crises and natural disasters for decades, from Haiti to the Philippines. But the deadly nature of Ebola combined with the expense of treating it -- the clinic will cost about $1 million per month to operate -- make this the most complex humanitarian endeavor the organization has ever attempted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Mitchum, Heart to Heart's chief executive, said there are already six similar clinics in Liberia. Health officials estimate that 27 will be needed to treat the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are staring into the deep, dark pool of a frightening human crisis,&quot; Mitchum said, &quot;and we don't yet know where the bottom lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heart to Heart sent an advance team to Liberia several weeks ago. The team returned last week and decided the best use of the organization's resources would be to open a clinic staffed by volunteer doctors and nurses in Kakata, a city located about 40 miles from Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction should be finished by November. The clinic will be opened with the support of several NGOs and the backing of the U.S. and Liberian governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Lee Norman, the chief medical officer at University of Kansas Medical Center, has pledged the hospital's support to Heart to Heart's mission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has also offered its assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many relief organizations have been criticized for putting volunteers in danger by sending them to nations such as Liberia. Mitchum dismissed such criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must fight this disease where it is, stop it where it is,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't have an opportunity to put a fence around West Africa then let it burn itself out. That's not how we deal with people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has turned over an Ambulance vehicle and a consignment of assorted materials to the Ministry of Health Ebola Task Force and the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN) respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an official Turn over ceremony, UNDP Country Director Kamil Kamaluddeen said the donation is part of the UNDP's continuous support to the Government of Liberia in the Ebola Fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicle is to serve Sinoe County, as UNDP steps up its support to Counties' response to combat EVD, while the consignment of assorted supplies to the BIN, is intended to strengthen cross border security in the fight against the Ebola Virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNDP remains committed to providing the adequate support to the security sector in playing a vibrant and optimal role in the fight against Ebola, by enhancing its capacity&quot;, says UNDP Country Director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consignment of assorted materials to the BIN included 10 desktop computers, 10 printers, 30 cartons of A4 sheet, assorted radio communication equipment and accessories, 60 pieces of temperature testers among others. The package is worth over $59,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding on behalf of the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services and Chairman of the Ebola Incident Management System (IMS) Tolbert Nyensuah said UNDP has been supportive to the government's recovery process through various initiatives and programs over the years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Nyensuah said the UN Agency has also been more instrumental in supporting community based activities across Liberia in the fight Ebola, adding that the donation of the vehicle will help enhance the Government's capacity to deal with the Outbreak mainly in the South-eastern part of the Country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are serving all the counties; right now, we have thirteen (13) ambulances in Montserrado County, we sent some to Grand Bassa, we've served... the Southeastern Region we need to move robustly in that area and Sinoe has a very greater need&quot;... Minister Nyensuah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Health Minister said, although there are fewer cases being reported in Sinoe County, it is important to ensure that those cases are contained. On his part, the Head of the Immigration Bureau, Counselor Lemuel Reeves described UNDP as strong partner to security sector reform in the Country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counselor Reeves spoke of the enormous challenges being experienced by the Justice and security sector, and the level of support provided by UNDP to help reduce the constraints and barriers faced by this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take this time to say a big &quot;Thank you&quot; to UNDP and assure that these supplies will be used in aiding the BIN live up to its statutory mandate. As part of the Government of Liberia response to fighting the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), UNDP provided support with an initial amount of $148,080 mobilized through the Crisis Prevention window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall objective of the support was to improve the response capacity of the Government of Liberia to the epidemic of Ebola virus Disease in Liberia through strengthening EVD coordination, contact tracing, sensitization and surveillance in the most affected counties mainly Lofa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY ALEX BRUMMER CITY EDITOR COMMENT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">765 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the leading figures at the IMF, including the managing director Christine Lagarde, chief economist Olivier Blanchard and the overseer of financial stability, former Spanish central banker Jos&eacute; Vi&ntilde;als, are from eurozone nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what they say about the catastrophic reaction to the Great Recession and subsequent crisis among countries in the region cannot possibly be regarded as driven by a europhobe agenda. The Fund's findings ought to be of profound concern in Brussels, Berlin and Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eurozone is facing the twin problems of stagnation and deflation that led to a lost decade in Japan, from which it has never fully recovered. Moreover, the failure to deal with the region's banking problems in the aftermath of the 2008 panic, when former French president Nicolas Sarkozy saw the crisis as one of Anglo-Saxon capitalism, has proved a mistake of Great Depression proportions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of Europe's deepening problems are spelt out in impressive detail in the IMF's World Economic Outlook report. Output across the region this year, at best, will be 0.8pc (after two years in negative territory) and 1.3pc next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if those figures are achieved it will do virtually nothing to cure endemic unemployment at 11.2pc across the region and the grotesque levels of joblessness among a whole generation of young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever wondered why almost every shop, restaurant, hotel assistant in Britain speaks with a euro accent? It is because Britain, with its growing economy, offers jobs and hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it could even get worse for the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany, the engine of the eurozone, is stuttering because of a lack of demand for its manufactured exports from its neighbours, the slowdown in Asia and the loss of business confidence as a result of geo-political tensions with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France cannot even get Brussels to agree its national budget, because the deficit is way above the 3pc of total output level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fund's Global Financial Stability report tells of a totally dysfunctional European banking system. This has been obvious for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fund was warning two years ago of a 200bn black hole in the balance sheets of the major banks. Nothing has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An IMF survey of 300 banks in the advanced world found that a quarter of them, mainly in the eurozone, do not have adequate capital buffers to support lending expansion of 5pc a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the eurozone, 46pc of banks with 60pc of the assets are unable to support recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work on shoring up the banking system in Europe is now in the hands of the European Central Bank. It has recruited the staff but finds it all but impossible to get the work done. The Bundesbank, a powerful force within the ECB, disputes the whole concept of the ECB as a bank regulator even though that is the case in both Washington and London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people in Germany, including the Constitutional Court, much like the idea of the country shoring up the whole of Europe's broken banking system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lessons of the Great Recession is that the governments showing the most progress are those which were willing to put to one side anger at the role of the banks and financiers in the creation of the crisis and move to bail them out and recapitalise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US and Britain led the way, but Spain and Ireland followed and both nations are now showing some signs of emerging from the danger zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks supply the credit that is particularly important for smaller and medium-sized businesses, the bedrock of all economic systems, but they cannot go directly to the money markets in the manner of Siemens, Volkswagen, Danone or Lafarge. Until Brussels wakes up to this, the eurozone economies are doomed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE woes of London Mining almost certainly have more to do with the slumping price of iron ore, rather than the ebola crisis in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is a poignant reminder of what the tragedy of the ebola epidemic threatens to do to the African economy, until recently one of the most dynamic regions on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank estimates potential regional impact of $32.6bn by the end of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be a happy outcome for banks heavily exposed to Africa which include Standard Chartered, HSBC, Barclays and Bob Diamond's Atlas Mara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN we talk of the G7 we think of the world's seven largest industrial economies: the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMF's World Economic Outlook report points out that if you add up the GDP of the Brics - Brazil, Russia, India and China - together with Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey, you get a total output of $37.8trillion against $34.5trillion in the existing G7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SPANISH ebola victim's pet dog was put down last night over fears it could transmit the disease, prompting outrage from animal lovers who chanted murderers' outside the woman's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fury erupted after a government health spokesman confirmed that Teresa Romero Ramos's dog, Excalibur, had been destroyed. The official explained: Unfortunately we had no other choice.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The animal was put to sleep inside Mrs Romero Ramos's home, which was disinfected before the animal's body was taken away in a white van to a nearby incinerator.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators who mounted a vigil outside to try to stop the move shouted murderers' and several threw themselves on the ground as the vehicle left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 300,000 people had already signed a petition urging authorities to spare Excalibur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter was awash with photographs of dogs, cats and birds which were posted alongside the hashtag SalvemosAExcalibur' - Spanish for Let's save Excalibur'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Romero Ramos, 44, from Galicia in north-west Spain, who is one of the medical team that treated two repatriated Spanish priests who died from ebola, has been in quarantine since it was confirmed she was carrying the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has now admitted touching her face with her gloves as she took off a protective suit after leaving the room of one of the priests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Romero Ramos confessed her accident to a doctor after earlier insisting that she had no idea how she became infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital chief German Ramirez said yesterday - 48 hours after the launch of a probe into how Mrs Romero Ramos caught the virus - It looks like we have found the origin.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the speed with which he attributed the shock transmission to a slip-up' failed to silence critics who demanded that heads rolls after a string of spectacular mistakes by health co-ordinators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health minister Ana Mato is facing calls for her resignation after it emerged that Mrs Romero Ramos complained of feeling unwell six days before she was eventually admitted to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was rushed to hospital by unprotected paramedics in a normal ambulance only taken out of service 12 hours later and found out she had ebola by reading a Spanish newspaper website as she waited to be quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her home in Alcorcon near Madrid that she shares with husband Javier Limon Romero, one of those quarantined at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, was not disinfected until yesterday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six people in total have now been quarantined since the start of Monday's crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include three other hospital nursing staff who helped treat Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, the Spanish priests who died after they were repatriated from West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Romero Ramos was reportedly feeling better after being treated with antibodies from an ebola survivor. She told a Spanish TV station by phone: Today I'm better. It's slow going but I'm better.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revealing how she discovered she was infected, she said: Nobody told me anything. I suspected something because at the beginning the nurses and doctors came in every hour, then they stopped coming in and I thought that something was up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I got hold of my mobile and that's when I saw on the website of El Pais newspaper that I had tested positive for ebola twice. Nobody ever told me to my face, &quot;Teresa you've got ebola&quot;.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went on to say that she had been given only 20 minutes' training in how to put on and take off her protective suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AGONY OF LOVERS WHO CAN ONLY TALK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIDEO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British girlfriend of photojournalist Ashoka Mukpo said watching him battle ebola is heart-wrenching'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen Finlay said that Mr Mukpo, 33, who was flown to the US from Liberia on Monday, waved to her as he left the plane and had spoken to her via video-link from his isolation unit at Nebraska Medical Center. She added: When you have a loved one who is as sick as he is, you want to curl up next to them and tell them &quot;you're going to be okay&quot; and be close to them, and obviously you can't do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a little bit hard. I miss him, I really miss him.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mukpo was working for NBC as a cameraman when he developed symptoms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tesco shares rose 2&frac12;p, or 1.4pc, to 185.1p, after David McCarthy of HSBC upgraded his recommendation on the stock to &quot;neutral&quot;, from &quot;underweight&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The grocer hit its lowest level since 2003 when a &pound;250m black hole was discovered in its accounts a fortnight ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, thanks to the cautiously upbeat assessment issued by Mr McCarthy yesterday, the stock rose for a third straight trading session, the first time the troubled supermarket group has managed such a run since mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A rights issue would improve the underlying strength of Tesco and would simultaneously create problems for Sainsbury at a corporate level,&quot; the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, a fund-raising may be &quot;positively&quot; received by Tesco investors &quot;as it would help resolve balance sheet concerns, while buying time to undertake asset disposals without a fire sale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the market's worries about the company are now reflected in Tesco's bombed-out share price, he added. &quot;We expect further bad news on accounting, pensions and a re-basing of profits but believe much of this is now in the price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, Tesco ended the session as the third biggest riser in the FTSE 100, which fell for a second day to close off 13.34 points, or 0.2pc, at 6,482.24, weighed down by the now-familiar cocktail of global growth and geopolitical concerns, as well as worries about the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mid- and small-cap shares were much harder hit. The second-tier FTSE 250 slumped 165.7 points, or 1.1pc, to 14,933.52, and the FTSE Aim All-Share index slid 1.2pc, its worst one-day fall since June. The junior market is weighted toward oil and mining companies, which have been hurt by the sell-off in commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in the FTSE 100, ITV, like Tesco, was lifted by broker research, closing up 1.4p at 205.8p after Credit Suisse analysts repeated their &quot;outperform&quot; on the broadcaster and added the stock to both their European and global focus lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The recent pull-back, on global growth concerns, provides an attractive entry point for investors looking for exposure to one of the rare, growing, TV content assets in Europe,&quot; they told clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company is viewed by many as a takeover target, especially after Liberty Global took a 6.4pc stake in July. The Credit Suisse analysts gave the broadcaster a 346p &quot;blue sky&quot; valuation and said &quot;any third party seeking to control ITV would need to pay a premium over this 346p combined value&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, &quot;buy&quot; recommendations from both Peel Hunt and Berenberg boosted outsourcing and construction group Interserve 22&frac12;p higher to 610&frac12;p. Conversely, GKN, the car and plane parts maker, was knocked 10.7p to 294.7p following a double-downgrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, who cut to &quot;underperform&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;, missing out the &quot;neutral&quot; rating altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On the back of increasingly negative news flow on global automotive and industrial end-markets, we see a downside risk to GKN's Driveline, Land Systems and PowderMet divisions, which together represent circa 70pc of full-year 2013 sales and 60pc of profits,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Travel stocks remained under pressure amid concerns that the arrival of the deadly Ebola virus in Europe would curb demand. TUI Travel fell 15p to 367p on worries the outbreak could affect its merger with its German parent; cruise operator Carnival, which has cancelled stops in West Africa because of the disease, slid 29p to &pound;22.99 and easyJet declined 11p to &pound;13.78.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the Ebola case in Spain is a one-off and the virus is contained, the sector should rally sharply, in our view. Otherwise, expect a sharp but perhaps short-lived sell-off,&quot; said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil companies, meanwhile, were dragged lower by the falling price of oil, with Brent crude sliding as much as 1.5pc during intraday trade. Tullow Oil lost 24&frac12;p to a near six-year low of 576p, Ophir Energy declined 10&frac12;p to 212.3p and Soco International closed down 16.7p at 352.8p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tullow and Ophir both have interests in West Africa, where the Ebola outbreak began, and so worries about the virus were an additional weight on the shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disruption caused by the deadly disease was also one of the factors that yesterday caused Sierra Leone-focused iron ore producer London Mining to admit that there was &quot;little or no value&quot; in its shares. The stock slumped as much as 96.1pc before retail investors chased the miner off its worst level to close down 2.35p, or 75.8pc, at &frac34;p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, beleaguered infrastructure group Balfour Beatty was hurt by the closure of Blackpool Airport, which is 95pc owned by the FTSE 250 company. It closed off 6.8p at 161.6p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The failure to find a buyer may, in our view, provide a further concern to investors, since Balfour has indicated it will consider further disposals,&quot; said Westhouse Securities analyst Alastair Stewart.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON Mining, the debt-ridden Aimlisted miner, has warned that its shares could have &quot;little or no value&quot; if a financial restructuring with a strategic investor takes place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The grim update follows the iron ore miner's admission last week that it was running out of money to service its only operating mine in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This looks like the end of the road for London Mining unless a new investor charges to the rescue,&quot; analysts at Numis Securities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London Mining, which traded above 400p a share in 2011 closed 76pc lower at 0.75p yesterday, valuing the business at just &pound;1m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bankers at Goldman Sachs and Standard Bank are trying to drum up strategic interest in the business, but industry bankers believe that the slew of bad news could mean that the mining tiddler will end up in the hands of its creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indian steel conglomerate Jindal was reportedly weighing a takeover of the business, which would give it control of the mine at a knockdown price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India's third-biggest steel maker declined to comment on the speculation, but added in a Bombay stock exchange filing that as &quot;a long-term strategy, we would like to expand both organically by means of brownfield and greenfield expansions and inorganically by acquiring some existing assets. In that perspective, we keep scanning suitable opportunities, which have a strategic fit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London Mining's desperate position follows a spat with commodities giant Glencore over the pricing of an iron ore supply contract, which is said to have put a squeeze on its short-term cash position. It is understood that Glencore is unlikely to show an interest in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London Mining has been suffering from an oversupply of the steel-making commodity, which has led to iron ore prices languishing at the lowest level since 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company has also blamed the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone for its troubles, which have &quot;introduced signifi-cant challenges both to the strategic investor process that the company began in May and to the ongoing operational performance of the business&quot;. In June, the company moved &quot;non-essential&quot; staff out of Sierra Leone, chartering flights to remove employees from the country. The company warned that the disruption caused by the outbreak could cost it an additional $1 per tonne of iron ore produced in 2014 and force a reduction in drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some industry figures countered that the company's troubles ran deeper than the ongoing Ebola crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London Mining has a total debt pile of $310m (&pound;191m) with a consortium of banks. Conversations are also taking place with trade finance bank Afreximbank, which has agreed a $30m twoyear financing facility, but this is not expected to be available in the necessary time period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE spread of the deadly Ebola virus could result in a &pound;20bn hit to economies in Africa and cause turmoil in financial markets, experts have warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank yesterday outlined a worst-case scenario that would see almost 12pc wiped off the economy of Liberia, the country worst affected by the outbreak, and 3.3pc off the entire west African region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts at Barclays predicted that, if the virus establishes itself further in Asia or the West, the impact on financial markets could be as bad as that caused by Asia's SARS outbreak a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of people Ebola has killed is now more than 3,400 and the virus appears to be spreading beyond Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Shares in UK-listed travel companies and airlines fell amid growing fears that the spread of the virus would hit demand. TUI Travel, easyJet and British Airways-owner IAG all dropped yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under a &quot;High Ebola&quot; scenario, in which the virus spreads beyond the current locations to neighbouring Nigeria and Ivory Coast, the World Bank estimated the cost to these economies would be $32.6bn (&pound;20.3bn) - or 3.3pc of the combined GDPs of the countries affected - by the end of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also see growth across the region fall from 6.9pc last year to 5.6pc in 2014 and 4.1pc in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the virus can be contained and managed within the three countries currently affected, this &quot;Low Ebola&quot; scenario would still result in a $3.8bn hit. The World Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, said: &quot;The international community now must act on the knowledge that weak public health infrastructure, institutions and systems in many fragile countries are a threat not only to their own citizens but also to their trading partners and the world at large.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barclays analyst Marvin Barth said yesterday the spread of Ebola beyond the currently affected areas would &quot;have a significant impact on global financial markets&quot;, well beyond the anxiety created by Asia's experience with SARS in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Afflicted countries' relatively small weight in global GDP, trade and financial markets so far has limited Ebola's effects on global markets despite an already largerthan-SARS death toll,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great efforts are being made to contain the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa and treat its victims. The courage and dedication of health workers at the forefront of this fight have been exemplary. The American government has despatched thousands of soldiers to the areas most affected, and now Britain is to send 750 military personnel and a fleet auxiliary medical ship to Sierra Leone. This is a justified deployment given the importance of halting the spread of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it is a great disappointment that lax safety protocols in Spain appear to have allowed this deadly virus to enter Europe. Five people, including a nurse who treated a Spanish priest recently returned from Sierra Leone, have contracted Ebola or are showing signs of having done so. Some 50 others who have been in contact with the victims are also being monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while vigilance is necessary, we should avoid hysteria. Ebola is not as easily transmittable as, say, influenza, and the NHS is good at managing unusual infectious diseases. This presupposes that sufferers can be identified, and it is here where controversy lies. President Obama has ordered US border officials to screen incoming air passengers for the virus, yet in the UK there are no plans to follow suit. Public Health England said it would mean screening &quot;huge numbers of low-risk people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, if a case of Ebola were reported here, the infected person would be isolated and protective measures implemented. It does not follow that because there has been an outbreak in Spain that we are at any greater risk. But public reassurance is important; and while not screening for it seems sensible now, the policy needs to be kept under review in case this crisis becomes a catastrophe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE nurse in Madrid who became the first case infected with Ebola outside West Africa, repeatedly tried to report her symptoms to health authorities, but was told to take paracetamol before being finally diagnosed with the deadly virus and put into isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mar&iacute;a Teresa Romero Ramos has admitted that she likely caught the virus when she touched her face with a contaminated glove as she removed her protective suit after visiting the room of the infected missionary priest who was repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the first indication as to how she became infected with the deadly haemorrhagic fever, as Spanish health officials struggled to contain the virus and placed two more nurses under quarantine and dozens of others under observation for symptoms of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it emerged that a catalogue of errors led to her not being isolated in a specialised unit until six days after she showed signs of the illness and after she had sought medical advice three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 44-year-old believes that she became infected after cleaning up waste in the room of Manuel Garcia Viejo, the 69-year-old missionary who died on Sept 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the error was in the removal of the [protective] suit,&quot; Mrs Romero told Spanish daily El Pa&iacute;s newspaper in a telephone interview from her hospital bed. &quot;I see that as the most critical moment, when something could have happened. But I'm not sure,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health investigators attempting to reconstruct events that led to her infection confirmed that she had told them she may have touched her face while removing the protective suit, an error that she was not aware of at the time, and, therefore, did not report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She has talked to me about the gloves, she touched her face with the gloves. That's what she remembers and what she has told me three times,&quot; Germ&aacute;n Ram&iacute;rez, one of the doctors at Carlos III hospital where the nurse is being treated, said outside the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When she left work to go on holiday, the day after the missionary had died, the nurse was told to take her temperature twice a day and report any symptoms to the specialist occupational risk team at the Carlos III hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four days later, on Sept 30, she reported suffering from a mild fever and general fatigue, but as her temperature had not reached the 38.6C threshold, she was advised to visit her local clinic, where she was reportedly prescribed paracetamol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several days later and with no sign of her fever abating she again contacted health authorities, but no action was taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was not until Sunday night, when her fever had reached the 38.6C barrier, that she was advised by clinicians at the Carlos III unit to contact her local hospital. She was then transported in an ambulance by paramedics who were not dressed in protective clothing to the emergency department of the Alcorc&oacute;n hospital. Once there, after reportedly waiting some time in a busy waiting room, she informed medics that she feared she may have contracted Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The nurses who dealt with me were wearing normal clothes without any protection when they took me to hospital,&quot; Mrs Romero told El Pa&iacute;s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hospital staff at Alcorc&oacute;n have complained that the patient was left in an improvised isolation area marked off by a curtained screen and security tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, six hours after tests confirmed that she was infected with Ebola, she was transferred in a specialist ambulance to the isolation unit set up at Carlos III hospital where the missionaries had been treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the 84 people now under observation by Madrid health authorities are those she had contact with at her local hospital, others are family and friends with whom she had close contact with while feeling unwell, and the remainder are those who also treated the repatriated missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her husband is in quarantine, although has yet to show symptoms of the virus. So, too, are three other nurses who were in the original medical teams assigned to care for the missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coordinator of emergency health services at the Spanish ministry of health, Fernando Sim&oacute;n, has conceded that it would have been better to have admitted the nurse into hospital earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that although she had not presented the symptoms used by clinicians to suspect a case of Ebola, her history of having been in contact with the stricken missionaries meant it would have been preferable to err on the side of caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In this case it would have been better to have admitted her for observation on September 30 rather than wait for the more serious symptoms,&quot; said Mr Sim&oacute;n.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, appealed for calm over Spain's Ebola outbreak and pledged to step up efforts to contain the virus. &quot;Let the professionals do their work,&quot; he told the Spanish parliament on Wednesday. &quot;What we have to do right now is be alert, but stay calm - this is the government's position.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dog owned by the Spanish nurse who became the first to contract Ebola in Europe was last night put down by order of health officials in Madrid despite a furious campaign by animal lovers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excalibur, the 12-year-old rescue dog of Maria Teresa Romero Ramos and her husband Javier Limon, pictured with the pet, was destroyed as a precautionary measure by authorities trying to limit the spread of Ebola. However, the decision enraged animal rights protesters, who clashed with police as they blockaded the apartment building in the Madrid suburb of Alcorc&oacute;n, where the dog had been locked up since its owners were quarantined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Campaigners had hoped for a last-minute reprieve after the rector of the Complutense University of Madrid - where Excalibur was ordered to be taken to be destroyed - refused to allow the dog to be &quot;sacrificed&quot; there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A petition, organised online at www.change.org, had almost 400,000 signatures. A Facebook page, set up to campaign on the animal's behalf, had more than 86,000 &quot;likes&quot; and the Twitter hashtag &quot;Save Excalibur&quot; - #SalvarExcalibur - was being widely spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fate of the dog became a flashpoint as anger mounted over the authorities' handling of the Ebola outbreak. Experts on Ebola had argued that the dog should be kept alive, even if infected, so that more can be understood about the virus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SCHOOL in Stockport has cancelled the visit of a charity worker and banned her son from attending lessons after &quot;ignorant&quot; parents feared their children would be infected with Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elizabeth Inman, the head teacher, wrote to parents on Tuesday to say that &quot;with a very heavy heart&quot; the school had decided to stop the visit, despite both mother and son being screened by the Health Protection Agency and given the lowest risk level possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miriam Mason-Sesay, who is British but has lived in Sierra Leone since 2000, where she is country director for education charity EducAid, said the decision was down to &quot;ignorant&quot; parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've been met with leper-type attitudes from wealthy people overreacting and trying to protect themselves from a threat that isn't there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine-year-old Kofi Mason-Sesay was due to study at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Hazel Grove, Stockport, this month while his mother was in Britain fund-raising for EducAid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kofi, who travels to Britain with his mother twice a year and has attended the Stockport school previously, said he felt &quot;upset&quot; and &quot;rejected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, Ms Mason-Sesay, 48, was awarded an MBE for her education and charitable work. She said: &quot;If we are being treated like this, how will others from Sierra Leone be treated, how will West Africans be treated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea that Ebola is lurking behind every flipping tree and is out to get to you is absolute nonsense. There is a willingness [among some parents] to believe 'what we should do is hunt [Kofi] down, protect our own and sod the rest'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, the school had tried to reassure parents that the visit posed no risk. It took advice from health chiefs in the borough and passed on guidance that anyone travelling from affected countries but free of symptoms was not infectious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Inman said: &quot;I understand there is a lot of misinformation about how Ebola is spread. A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops will head to Sierra Leone as early as next week, where British military engineers and medics are overseeing the building of an Ebola hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around 750 personnel will help set up treatment centres and an Ebola training academy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures were decided during a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergency committee, as the Foreign Secretary said the world had to do more &quot;to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RFA Argus, a medical ship with a 100-bed hospital on board, will be sent, along with three Merlin helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said the disease had become &quot;an unprecedented threat that knows no borders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We have to get ahead of this disease, but if we get ahead of it, if we rise to the challenge, we can contain it and beat it. We know how to do this, it is not complicated to do, it just requires a large focus of resource and effort to deliver it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added: &quot;We now need the wider international community to step up to the plate and deliver that additional resource, not just money, but trained medical and clinical personnel to lead that effort on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We all have to do more if we are going to prevent what is currently a crisis from becoming a catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, said: &quot;Following today's meeting, we are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak, on land, in the air and at sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The troops will include soldiers of the Royal Scots Borders 1st Battalion based in Co Down, Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt Col Matt Munro, commanding officer, said: &quot;Of course there is a risk of soldiers from this battalion contracting the virus, but it is a very low risk because there are all sorts of very practical and sensible measures that my people can employ... And it is worth saying also that, for the most part, my soldiers have been queuing up to deploy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITAIN was last night urged to bring in Ebola screening at airports as the US stepped up security in response to the growing crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US secretary of state, John Kerry, warned that there was &quot;no time to waste&quot; as he announced that travellers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea would face body-tem-perature tests and enhanced questioning at US airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary admitted the disease &quot;knows no borders&quot;, while Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said it was &quot;now entirely possible that someone with Ebola will come to the UK&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the growing alarm, Public Health England said it would not be changing guidance to airports, where staff are advised to take action only if passengers are showing visible signs of the disease. Last night Keith Vaz MP called for screening to be introduced. &quot;What we need to ensure is that the public feel there is confidence at our borders and that means we need to put in screening at our borders in order to give the public that confidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said &quot;focusing on flights from high-risk areas would help&quot;, but warned it may give a false sense of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, the Government announced that more than 750 British troops, along with three helicopters and a medical ship, would be sent to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Downing Street also announced that a &quot;national exercise&quot; will take place to &quot;ensure the UK is fully prepared&quot;, although no further details were available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day, 21 July, began like any other Monday for Ameyo Adadevoh, a doctor in Africa's most populous city, Lagos. In a crowded midtown district, the usual jumble of patients awaited at the hospital where Adadevoh was known to sometimes give free drugs to those who could not afford it. Among them was a patient who had been wheeled in the previous evening, feverish and vomiting, diagnosed with severe malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Liberian-American civil servant Patrick Sawyer had slipped through three layers of security - a quarantine order, and airport checks in Liberia and Nigeria - intended to stem an outbreak in three west African countries. Within 24 hours, he became Nigeria's Ebola patient zero, the small hospital was forced to become a makeshift Ebola ward, and Adadevoh, an endocrinologist, found herself thrust into the role of stopping the disease's spread in the continent's most populous country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Nigeria has so far emerged relatively unscathed from its brush with Ebola owes much to the quick-thinking staff at an ordinary family clinic, who put themselves in the firing line for six days before the government was ready to relocate Sawyer. Nigeria has recorded just seven Ebola fatalities so far. But, as elsewhere in this epidemic, those on the frontline paid the highest price: four of those who died were health workers, including Adadevoh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried everything we could. Any way we could get her out, any medicine; everybody was trying,&quot; said her son, Bankole. &quot;The saddest part is that she stayed here in Nigeria to run a health centre people could trust, and it's the Nigerian system that let her down in the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in specially equipped isolation wards, the slightest slip-ups - whether through poor equipment or inadequate training - can be deadly. Health authorities in Spain blamed substandard equipment for the infection of a nurse this week in Europe's first recorded case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while isolated cases will always be a risk even in advanced healthcare systems, overwhelmed hospitals in west Africa have become places of horror for patients and doctors alike. As the epidemic has exposed weak healthcare systems and leaderships in disarray, leaving nearly 3,500 dead in its wake, far more might have died if not for many local health workers soldiering on armed with little more than conviction and courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the bodies of Ebola victims were dumped in the streets when burial teams went on strike over pay, the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation said. Health ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis said the situation was &quot;very embarrassing&quot; and that money was available to pay the teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recently an ambulance driver at Sierra Leone's colonial-built Connaught hospital offloaded a suspected Ebola patient wearing only a plastic apron for protection. A trail of water flowed out of the open isolation unit door into corridors lined with posters of nurses and doctors who had died of the disease. &quot;We really don't have the equipment to feel 100% secure, but what else can we do? We need to help these people,&quot; the ambulance driver said as he hosed himself down later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To safely manage a treatment centre of 70 beds, the World Health Organisation estimates that at least 200 medical staff are needed, of whom roughly a fifth should be foreign doctors who provide training and supervision. A belated surge of international aid has included engineers, medical kit and money, but boots on the ground are still lacking. Medecins sans Frontieres, the non-governmental organisation leading efforts, said it opened its doors in Liberia for 30 minutes each day just to fill the number of beds vacated by survivors or the dead. Another western health NGO said fewer than 10 US doctors had volunteered, compared with more than 400 during the 2010 Haiti crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the private grief of the families of more than 240 health workers who have died has also had an alarming public impact: it removes pillars in already fragile health systems, shrinking the pool of talent from which to rebuild devastated healthcare systems when international organisations leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's success shows how a determined response can nip an epidemic in the bud, despite early official inertia. Home to the village that gave Lassa fever - a haemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola and endemic in the region - its name, Africa's largest economy did not have a single functional isolation ward when Ebola struck six months into the west African epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Adadevoh set up aggressive barrier nursing, organised the disinfection of the hospital, and downloaded and distributed Ebola factsheets. For six days, the clinic's staff effectively ran an Ebola isolation unit with no government help. When Liberian presidential officials called to insist Sawyer be released to attend a conference - he was a high-ranking civil servant - the hospital refused to let him go. And when an isolation ward was finally set up, Adadevoh visited even as other doctors refused to volunteer to staff it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the authorities' slow revving into action eventually produced remarkable results. Drawing on a polio-surveillance system, health workers made 18,000 visits to 900 people to check the temperatures of possible contacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Adadevoh arrived at the isolation centre she had lobbied to improve. Eleven days after she died, Nigeria recorded its last Ebola case. &quot;If anything comes of this, all we want is an improvement in healthcare, especially public healthcare, in Nigeria,&quot; her son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the slow trickle of workers to replace exhausted international and local volunteers continues to take a devastating toll. Sierra Leone's population of 6 million is served by about 120 doctors; those who have succumbed include the only haemorrhagic fever specialist. In Liberia, which has one doctor for every 70,000 people, the chief medical officer placed herself under quarantine after her office assistant died of Ebola this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak first began in Guinea in December, but it took two months to identify the unfamiliar illness ravaging isolated communities, where there is one doctor per 10,000 inhabitants. By the time Ebola made landfall in neighbouring Sierra Leone, most health workers at the Kenema government hospital fled. Not so Sheikh Umar Khan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For more than a week, he was the only doctor in the ward. He was finding it very difficult to get young colleagues to come in to work,&quot; said Mohamed Barrie, a close friend of Khan's since they met at medical school, and himself just one of three doctors serving a population of almost 600,000 in neighbouring Kono.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrie last saw Khan at the ministry of health in June, where he was lobbying on behalf of health workers striking over unpaid salaries and dire working conditions. &quot;He was trying to encourage the ministry on what they needed to do to build up trust and get doctors back in,&quot; said Barrie. &quot;It's not easy in Sierra Leone. You work all these years without even running water in hospitals, and then you see a more junior doctor go into government and suddenly they're building a house and have a new car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone ranks 119th out of 177 on Transparency International's corruption index and abiding suspicion towards officials meant many originally dismissed Ebola as a government hoax to plunder public coffers. Khan could not have foreseen that his own death would mark a turning point, as ordinary citizens finally accepted that a disease that felled one of the country's most admired doctors had to be real. Ironically, Sierra Leone and Liberia invested the highest percentage of GDP on health in sub-Saharan Africa in 2012, at 15.1% and 15.5% respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But trust in the sector had been deeply eroded after a free maternal healthcare programme intended to lift the country from the bottom of global indexes had been beset by doctors and nurses secretly charging money. Last year, 29 top health officials were indicted for siphoning about half a million dollars from a childhood immunisation fund sponsored by the Gates Foundation. The ministry of health said the indictments were a sign that corruption was being tackled. The government has put in $11.4m (&pound;7m) towards a $26m Ebola fund, the ministry spokesman added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, doctors went on strike again in September after a fourth doctor, Olivet Buck, died in the capital, Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was bemoaning that they didn't have gloves, protective suits, that kind of thing. She felt the lack of political will to tackle public health issues was a powder keg waiting to explode,&quot; said her brother Albert, a GP in the UK. &quot;There's inertia and a lack of looking into ourselves to find the solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Buck had told her brother about fuel money for ambulances being diverted. &quot;They were always having to find a way to make do,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert's dream of retiring in Freetown, surrounded by his childhood memories and family, were shattered by his sister's death. &quot;She was a hero. She died on the battleground. She and others should be held up - these are quiet heroes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week before his death, Khan had called the Barrie family. &quot;This is my fight, this was what I'm trained for, and I need to fight it to the end,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning Khan died, he was propped up in bed cheerfully listening to his radio before a presidential visit, said Vandy Cawray, a health official who was at his bedside. After weeks of mounting pressure, President Ernest Bai Koroma was making his first visit to the Ebola-hit east. &quot;The last thing he said to me was, 'soon I'm going to eat sharwarma again', because he was getting some appetite back,&quot; Cawray recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Khan died as the president was slowly putting on gloves to enter the isolation ward.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the World Bank, Jim Kim, admitted last night that the international community had &quot;failed miserably&quot; in its response to the Ebola virus that has killed more than 3,800 people in west Africa and warned that the crisis now affecting Spain and the US was going to get much worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid signs yesterday that western governments were being forced to take the risks of a global pandemic more seriously, Kim said he wanted them to back a new $20bn (&pound;12bn) global health fund that would be able to react instantly to emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's late. It's really late,&quot; he said in an interview with the Guardian before the annual meeting of the Washington-based organisation this weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should have done so many things. Healthcare systems should have been built. There should have been monitoring when the first cases were reported. There should have been an organised response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim's warning that the global community was still not &quot;moving fast enough&quot; came as the Ebola virus claimed its first victim in the US and news of a case in Spain sent shares in travel and airline companies tumbling on stock exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the number of deaths from Ebola in west Africa now stood at 3,879 with no evidence that the epidemic was being brought under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US has announced that it is scaling up its efforts and will tighten screening procedures at airports from this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Duncan, who died in a Dallas hospital yesterday after arriving from Liberia, lied in a questionnaire about whether he had been in contact with anyone affected by Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain also announced yesterday that it was scaling up its efforts to deal with the Ebola virus which has gripped Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of England's major hospitals are making preparations to isolate and treat patients suspected of having Ebola if a serious outbreak occurs, while more than 750 military personnel and the medical ship RFA Argus are being sent to west Africa to help contain the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RFA Argus has a fully-equipped hospital including critical care and high-dependency units, and will be sent to Sierra Leone along with three Merlin helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement followed a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, chaired by the prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the government has come under pressure to do more to prevent the disease spreading in the UK, including calls for the introduction of screening at airports and other transport hubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: &quot;We must do all we can, both at the source and in the UK, to combat the spread of this virus. Our immediate response should be to tighten regulation and introduce measures such as screenings at airports, train stations and ferry ports to ensure that this deadly disease cannot take more lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim said he welcomed the UK and the US scaling up their efforts, but said that a high price was being paid for 11 months of delay and inter-agency argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that there are cases in Spain and the US, the chance of the virus going to other European countries is fairly high,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blunt assessment of how the international community had coped with the crisis, Kim said: &quot;We were tested by Ebola and we failed. We failed miserably in our response.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged finance ministers attending meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund this weekend to provide the resources needed to treat Ebola patients in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Bank's plan, resources would be provided to build big specialised treatment centres and to extend care to local communities. Every developed country should be prepared to send trained medical staff to west Africa, Kim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need to stop all travel from these countries. It's going to be impossible to stop people. The way to stop the flow of patients from these countries getting to the rest of the world is to have programmes that will treat people and increase survival dramatically. It's possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to have quality services in place so that the motivation to leave these countries goes away. It is a rational thing to do to get away because we don't have the treatment in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudimentary healthcare systems in the three west African countries have encouraged people to travel abroad for treatment, thereby spreading the virus. Before the crisis, Liberia had 61 doctors and 1,000 nurses, while Sierra Leone had 327 hospital beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say to finance ministers: look at what's happening in Spain right now. It is going to get much worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities in Spain said they were dealing with the first case of Ebola that had been transmitted outside of the three west African countries - a nurse who treated a priest who had flown to Madrid for care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation said further &quot;sporadic&quot; cases of Ebola in Europe were now inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A World Bank study released yesterday showed that the economic cost of Ebola could be as high as $33bn over the next two years if the virus spreads to neighbouring countries in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim admitted that the Bank had been having arguments with the WHO over Ebola but that they had now stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important thing is to stop arguing about what is or is not possible and to get on with doing what's needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim said his plan involved big treatment centres being set up by the US and the UK together with attempts to provide as full a range of services as possible into local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;It would be good if you could manage the treatment of people close to home. But you can't do that without the personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to put the capacity into place so that cases are identified more quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam yesterday criticised the World Bank for its failure to invest enough in healthcare and in its promotion of user-fees and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicolas Mombrial, head of Oxfam in Washington, said: &quot;This has changed rhetorically under Jim Kim. We hope to see it play out in the Bank's lending and advice from now. Ebola should serve to accelerate this change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim said that countries such as Sierra Leone had used financial support from the Bank to improve energy supplies, but added: &quot;This has taught us that we have to be much more serious about putting health systems into place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He contrasted health systems in the three west African countries with Rwanda, which has 55,000 health workers. &quot;If this had happened in Rwanda we would have had it under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ebola highlighted the need to have a speedier way of responding to health crises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanish health officials have come under attack for their handling of the Ebola outbreak in a Madrid hospital (above). Dr Alison Pittard, a leading intensive care specialist, explains how the NHS's preparations for dealing with possible cases of Ebola should ensure the UK gets it right.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every NHS hospital trust has put in place guidance and protocols for what should be done if patients arrive with suspected Ebola and also how to recognise a patient with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main symptom is a fever of unknown origin in someone who has recently travelled in a high-risk area or has been close to a person suspected to have Ebola. All NHS staff now know, if you have a patient like that, you should ask: 'Is this Ebola?'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will not be something that any doctor or nurse has ever seen before. But it will need to be a diagnosis that's at the front of everyone's minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the systems have been put in place. But until we are faced with patients, we don't know if the preparations are adequate or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">England's major hospitals are making preparations to isolate and treat patients suspected of having Ebola if a serious outbreak occurs in Britain, the NHS said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NHS spokeswoman confirmed that all hospitals with the capacity to isolate patients, in siderooms or elsewhere, were &quot;gearing up&quot; for the possibility of receiving Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NHS announcement came as Britain pledged to deploy 600 extra military personnel to Sierra Leone next week to help combat Ebola. They will join 150 already in place and will be backed up by a ship, planes and helicopters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was made at a meeting of Cobra, the government's national emergencies committee, in Downing Street yesterday, where David Cameron was reassured by his officials that the risk to public health in the UK remains low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was briefed by Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, and Dr Paul Cosford, the head of Public Health England, who said training on how to deal with suspected Ebola cases had already been given to ambulance medics, hospitals, NHS 111, GPs and other key public health workers. Information posters for passengers on recognising the signs of Ebola will also be put up in UK airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Downing Street spokesman said: &quot;The case of (British nurse) Will Pooley has demonstrated the UK's ability to deal with an identified case without wider infection, with a world-leading specialist unit at the Royal Free hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vivienne Nathanson, the British Medical Association's senior director, called for a &quot;higher level of suspicion&quot; about the disease, with doctors being more aware of the possibility of patients with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;We do need to communicate to the public that if we do get Ebola, we don't want people walking into healthcare facilities. They need to phone and get emergency help that way, because the one thing you don't want is people who might be carrying something that's transmissible going into a facility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If cases do emerge, the NHS's plan is for initial patients to be taken to the Royal Free hospital, where Pooley - who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone - recovered from the disease in August and September after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the unit has only two beds, capacity there will be expanded as a first step, if the need arises, in order to utilise the skills and experience of its dedicated team of doctors, nurses and laboratory staff specialising in infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the hospital said it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that more than two patients would be admitted with Ebola at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that, the infectious diseases units at the Royal Liverpool hospitals, Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield and Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne would receive cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They would be either cases that had emerged in their area or potentially patients brought from London because the Royal Free was already at capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;many&quot; hospitals beyond those four could also play a part in treating Ebola, if enough cases emerged, the NHS England spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Nick Beeching, clinical director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit at the Royal Liverpool hospital, said that his unit was on standby to assist the Royal Free in managing patients with Ebola. However, &quot;whilst we are planning for this possibility we do not currently expect to care for any patients with confirmed Ebola. There is no risk to the general public and anybody coming to the Royal as a patient or visitor should not be concerned&quot;, Beeching added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a Dallas hospital announced the death of the first man diagnosed with Ebola in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan this morning,&quot; the Texas Health Presbyterian hospital said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House, said yesterday passengers travelling from west Africa will face additional Ebola screenings at five US airports. The five airports are John F Kennedy airport in New York; Newark, New Jersey; Dulles, outside Washington; Chicago and Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the five airports covered the destinations of 94% of passengers travelling to the US from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three west African countries worst affected by Ebola. He said that roughly 150 people a day would face extra screenings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason this approach makes sense is that it is a way to target additional screening . . . so that a very small number of people are inconvenienced,&quot; Earnest said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers flying from the disease-ravaged west African countries already face screenings at their departure airport.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanish health professionals have taken aim at the scant amount of training offered to those on the frontline fighting the Ebola virus as the investigation continues into how a Spanish nurse became the first person known to have contracted the disease outside of west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the doctor treating Ebola patient Teresa Romero Ramos said the infection might have been caused by &quot;an accident&quot; when the 44-year-old was taking off her protective equipment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">German Ramirez said he had spoken to the nurse three times in an effort to home in on how she got infected. Romero Ramos, he said, believes she might have touched her face with her gloves while she was taking off her protective equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview from her hospital bed, Romero Ramos told Spanish broadcaster Cuatro that while she had been given training on how to put on and take off the protective equipment, it was &quot;little training&quot;. She refused to give more details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her interview came as the number of patients in quarantine at Madrid's Carlos III hospital rose to six. Along with Romero Ramos and her husband, patients include three nurses who attended to the missionaries and a man who had travelled to Spain from Nigeria. Initial tests indicate that one of the nurses and the traveller are both free from Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health workers said they had had little preparation to deal with Ebola. For Amelia Batanero, a nurse at Madrid's La Paz hospital, the call to attend to the growing number of Ebola patients could come any day now as she is on the rotation list to work at the Carlos III hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in spite of the fact that she has never set foot in the hospital and that her only training took place months ago. &quot;We haven't learned how to use these suits, we don't know the protocol on how to treat Ebola,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July she was one of a group of nurses in Madrid who brought a complaint before a judge over their &quot;lack of training and knowledge regarding Ebola protocols&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Santiago Yus, a specialist in intensive care, echoed Batanero's concerns, telling El Mundo that he would likely be treating Ebola patients in the coming days. &quot;I'm not ready, I'm not trained,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor, who has more than 30 years' experience, said he had only been given a few 10-minute briefings months before and further questions had been directed to photographs on the wall explaining how to put on and take off the protective suit. This week, he was part of a group of 15 health workers who met with hospital management to warn them about their lack of preparation in facing Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the training was given during the summer, many health professionals were away on vacation, said Alda Recas of AME, an association of nurses in Madrid. &quot;When some people came back from their vacations, they were told they would have to take care of the missionaries. They would call you an hour, or half an hour, before their shift to show you how to put on the protective gear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is far worse at the Alcorcon hospital, where health workers never expected to be on the frontline of an Ebola outbreak, said one worker who declined to be named. &quot;We don't even have the required safety level at this hospital to take on Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, a screen and security tape made up the makeshift isolation unit for Romero Ramos while she was being tested. Doctors refused to confirm to her that she had twice tested positive for Ebola. As the nurse explained in her interview with Cuatro, &quot;I asked the doctor for the result and he didn't want to give it to me. Nobody told me anything.&quot; She eventually learned that she was infected with Ebola after checking news headlines on a mobile phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after Romero Ramos was transferred to the Carlos III hospital, the zone where she was treated in the Alcorcon hospital remains untouched. Cleaning staff have refused to clean the area, arguing that they don't have the right equipment or training to deal with the cleanup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blame for the varied response, said Roberto Tornamira of the workers' union FeS-UGT-Madrid, lay with the Spanish health ministry, as each hospital had been left to create a protocol on treating Ebola on its own. Calling it an &quot;incredible&quot; lapse of responsibility by health authorities, he noted that the lack of uniformity could have far-reaching consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, dozens of animal rights activists scuffled with police outside the apartment complex where Romero Ramos and her husband live, trying to stop workers from taking away their dog, Excalibur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madrid's regional government later said the animal had been euthanised. Authorities had obtained a court order to kill the dog, saying it could spread the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola patient Teresa Romero Ramos told a Spanish broadcaster that she had been given little training in using the protective equipment</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial enthusiasm after Fed minutes disappears on German growth worries</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 10 October 2013, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FTSE 100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was sitting at 6430, before subsequently rising - albeit in a rather volatile way - to its recent peak of 6878 in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a year later the leading index has fallen all the way back, closing down 50.39 points at 6431.85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It did not look like that at the start of the day, with markets enthused by the US Federal Reserve minutes which suggested fears of an early interest rate rise were misplaced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this optimism soon faded, as the current worries about global growth and geopolitical concerns reasserted themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week has seen a raft of poor data, from Germany in particular, and a 5.8% fall in exports reinforced fears about a possible recession in what is supposed to be the eurozone's powerhouse. Coming in the wake of the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts, that brought the sellers out once more. Comments from Chancellor George Osborne that the eurozone weakness was already hitting the UK economy also dented sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to that, was the continuing concern about air strikes on Isis, the situation in Ukraine and of course the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market falls accelerated as Wall Street opened, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 180 points by the time London closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of UK companies went ex-dividend including Kingfisher, which fell 15.9p to 296.8p, and Aviva, down 499.3p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the other fallers, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Vodafone</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell 6.95p to 197.35 as Nomura, highlighting competition worries, cut its target price to 180p from 190p and moved to reduce from neutral. Meanwhile Espirito Santo's Andrew Hogley issued a sell note at the prospect Vodafone might overpay for Italian broadband firm Fastweb, said to have been put up for sale by owner Swisscom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worries about the impact of Ebola on travel and tourism saw </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">easyJet</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lose another 37p to &pound;13.41 while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tui Travel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell 10.1p to 356.9p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However metal prices moved higher as the dollar weakened following the suggestion the Fed would not raise rates prematurely. So Mexican precious metals miner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Fresnillo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was up 46.5p to 770p and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Randgold Resources</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose 248p to &pound;42.98. Numis said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stick with our defensive criteria; our [mining] picks remain Randgold, Fresnillo and Petra which have superior growth profiles to counter-act flat to falling commodity prices, high quality assets to weather any downturn and strong management to deliver on business plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rio Tinto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose 64p to &pound;30.53 as Credit Suisse suggested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Glencore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, down 4.9p at 321.75p, could come back for another tilt at the iron ore specialist when it was allowed in six months time. Analyst Liam Fitzpatrick said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[After] Glencore's announcement that it was not actively considering a merger or offer [it] is now for the next six months subject to Rule 2.8 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (no offer without the consent of the Takeover Panel). However, this far from rules out a bid further down the line, in our view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been a number of unsuccessful deals in recent years (BHP/Rio, Vale/Xstrata, Xstrata/Anglo American) and...there are major obstacles to a deal not least of which is the polar opposite company cultures and buy in from major Rio shareholders (Chinalco, Ltd shareholders). However, big deals typically occur at the peak or trough of the cycle and the synergies on offer together with the potential to re-rate Rio through diversification could become all the more compelling if iron ore continues to move lower in 2015/16. Glencore may therefore be happy to play the waiting game but we expect the prospect of a second approach to remain an overhang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back among the losers </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Associated British Foods</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - owner of British Sugar as well as the more high profile Primark - fell 12p to &pound;25.53 after Germany's Suedzucker said the European sugar and ethanol markets had continued to deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the mid-caps, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Hays</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was 2.7p higher at 122.7p after the recruitment group reported an underlying 9% rise in first quarter fees, following strong demand in the UK, Australia and Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower down the market </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">New British Palm Oil</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in demand after it received a &pound;1.073bn or 715p a share offer from Malaysian plantation owner Sime Darby. Sime Darby director Anthony Dass said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a brown field asset, New British Palm Oil will immediately contribute to earnings without the incumbent risks associated with green field expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes just days after Sime Darby said it would not by the 49% stake in New British Palm Oil owned by Malaysian investment firm Kulim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, which has land holdings in Papua New Guinea, said it would recommend the bid, and Kulim said it would accept it, unless a higher offer came in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New British Palm Oil jumped 286p or 74% to 670p while fellow producer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">M P Evans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also benefited, up 7% to 457.625p. Analyst Charles Hall at Peel Hunt said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 10 days after stating that it had decided not to proceed with an offer for Kulim's shares, Sime Darby has now announced a cash offer at 715p (an 85% premium) for the entire company. Assuming Kulim agrees and given approval from the Papua New Guinea government, this deal should go through. The size of premium reflects the long term prospects for palm oil rather than the current weakness in the palm oil price. It also continues the theme of consolidation in the industry and demonstrates the value in MP Evans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that the termination of the talks with Kulim (who own 49%) was more due to time constraints rather than desire to proceed. Post the termination, New Britain's management was able to be involved and to help secure the necessary agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This deal values New Britain at $28,000 per mature hectare and $25,000 including immature hectares, though this does include the downstream and sugar assets. This looks an attractive price given the current palm price, at which level New Britain is moderately profitable. The price demonstrates the long term value in plantation assets rather than the short term issues. It also demonstrates the value in MP Evans, which is trading on c$10,000 per hectare. We expect consolidation in the industry to continue given the increasing difficulty of finding new land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Foreign Ministry release says the advanced Cuban medical professionals which arrived in the country on Saturday, October 4, 2014 is headed by Dr. Juan Carlos Dupuy Nunez. Other members of the delegation include Dr. Pablo Miguel, Raventon Vaguer, Mr. Andres Marrero Escobar, and Rolando Vergara Zito constituting of medical doctors, financial and logistical officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a courtesy call on Liberia's Foreign Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan at his Foreign Ministry Office on Monday, September 6, 2014, the Foreign Minister, on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the Government and people of Liberia, extended sincere gratitude to the Government and People of Cuba for demonstrating what he termed as a solid friendship and solidarity to people in greater needs: &quot;You are coming to help not just Liberia, but also the Republic of Sierra Leone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While lifting praises on Cuba, Minister Ngafuan noted that Cuba has over the years distinguished itself in the medical fields, referring to Cuban medical doctors as medical diplomats in the world. The Liberian Foreign Minister further assured the advance team of his ministry's fullest cooperation in helping them navigates through Liberia's governmental system, noting that Liberia has good diplomatic relations with Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Ngafuan disclosed that as Liberia battles against the deadly Ebola disease, the government is also working hard to upgrade the standard of its health facilities to deal with other related illnesses that are posing threats to the heath of the Liberian people. Minister Ngafuan then expressed confidence that with the coming of the Cuban doctors to assist in the fight against Ebola, the disease will soon be eradicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief remarks, the head of the advanced team, Dr. Nunez who introduced members of his delegation revealed that they are in Liberia as an advance-team of what is going to be a comprehensive team of about 50 experts that will arrive in Liberia very soon. According to Dr. Nunez, the Cuban medical team will be in the country as part of international response to control the virus in West Africa and the world and will be in Liberia to work with government in curbing the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Regla Angulo, head of the Cuban medical relief agency last month, announced Cuba's contribution in the Ebola fight by sending medical personnel to work in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia with the latest announcement now putting the total number at 461 Cuban medical personnel who would have been sent to help prevent the spread of the epidemic across west Africa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">532 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFL Engineers, with logistical and technical support from the US Army and with an actual workforce of forty well-trained personnel, have started the construction of nine Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in seven counties across Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process started since 11 September 2014 when the AFL Engineering team, with an initial strength of 20 personnel, started reconnaissance in the selected counties being assisted by technicians from the US SEABEES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The counties are Lofa, Bong, Margibi, Grand Bassa, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount and Nimba. Two ETU sites are to be erected in Lofa (Voinjama and Zorzor) while another two in Nimba at the Ganta Methodist Hospital and the Jackson F. Doe Memorial Hospital in Tappita. The rest of the ETUs will individually go to the five other counties: Margibi (Bong Mines area), Grand Bassa (BRE Compound, Own Your Own Community), Bomi (Government Hospital - Tubmanburg), Grand Cape Mount (Sinje) and Bong (Totota).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, AFL Engineers conducted the surveys, did the Bill of Quantities and designed the various ETU sites to be constructed across Liberia. Commencing the project, the AFL Engineersaugmenting their strength to 40 personnel will simultaneously construct three ETUs in Bomi, Bassa and Grand Cape Mount Counties, respectively. This will take between five to 12 days to be completed and presented to the Liberian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing reporters at the ground-breaking ceremony and receipt of the logistical materials at the Government Hospital in Tubmanburg, on October 3, 2014, Brigadier General Daniel D. Ziankhan, Chief of Staff of the AFL, stated that &quot;It is a joint operation with the U S Military and the AFL and commences the construction of many ETUs that will be constructed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Ziankhan said the project will last for 5 to 12 weeks and will take from 80 to 100 beds, noting that the AFL Engineers were already in Grand Bassa County carrying out geological survey. He said the land capacity depends on how much the county authority would provide for the 30 units intended for each area identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL which has now rolled out into civil-military operations according to its Chief of Staff, is doing everything to support the health sector and that means the military can transition from time to time, but the force remains committed to serving its people and nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, speaking to journalists, Brigadier General Peter Corey of the U S Department of Defense (DOD) added that their support is tied to the USAID which is the lead federal agency responsible for the U.S. response to fighting Ebola and assisting the Liberian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they are providing financial assistance and contracting, technical assistance and logistical assistance in partnership with the AFL and in support of the civilian leadership. General Corey said the DOD will not provide treatment instead will leave that to other agencies and the USAID as well as the Liberian Government to determine who manages and provide healthcare for the facilities upon their completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL Engineers are constructing ETUs at once to be used for the treatment of individuals suffering from the deadly Ebola virus disease that has taken away the lives of many Liberians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federation of Borough Youths (FOBY) has strongly condemned what they say is the continuous actions of the health workers at the John F. Kennedy hospital, Redemption and other healthcare centers to abandon and neglect of patients sick from Ebola and other illnesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesperson of the group said prior to the invasion of Liberia by deadly Ebola virus disease, there existed numerous of curable diseases that are native to the country which the health workers are fully aware of and understand the proper ways of managing or handling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberia has set another bad record of being the only country on earth where health workers who are under the oath to save lives abandon patients even with the availability of needed equipment and protective gears, FOBY said in a statement. &quot;History had never accounted for a country that attempt to fight an epidemic; thereby totally refusing to treat people with other curable diseases, most horribly those that were undergoing treatment prior to the outbreak of that epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Providing evidential support to its allegation, FOBY recalled the death of Mr. Jesse Karmoh, a Baptist pastor and former employee of the Department of Revenue at the Ministry of Finance as the result of what the group said was the rejection of the late prelate by JFK.&quot; The group also said Joshua Porte, a resident of the Borough of New Kru Town, who had suffered from appendicitis died after being rejected by Redemption and JFK hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most noticeably, a queen, highly talented youth, the face of the Stella Maris Polytechnic, a daughter of an educator, a professor, a lawmaker and chairman of the Montserrado county Legislative Caucus Hon. Edward Sieh Ford, Miss Nakita Diah Ford died after being rejected by both authorities and health workers at the JFK medical hospital,&quot; said FOBY further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the availability of the nebulizer to normalize her breathing in few minutes as she was suffering from Ashma, JFK doctors refused to touch her only because what they term as being comfortable with the Lawmaker and his daughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Borough youth called on President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to ensure the reopening of public hospitals for the treatment of other curable diseases to reduce the high level of death rate in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FOBY is thereby appealing to the President of Liberia to help clinics in the country, especially the Cora medical hospital in New Kru Town with some PPE in order to help buttress government effort in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in the country,&quot; they group pleaded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country which in the 1800s funded a Christian charity to found Africa's first black republic is still proving itself the largest donor of Liberia. Since the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, as it was in multiple past critical times, the United States continues to provide solid financial assistance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to dispatching hundreds of its soldiers and millions of dollars since March this year, the United States is making yet another seemingly relieving contribution to the African Union, the sum of US$10m, particularly for Liberia hit hardest by the Ebola pandemic. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Union has been further empowered by the United States to boost its presence in Liberia towards fighting Ebola. Liberia has attracted special attention for quick and substantive assistance since it has registered the highest fatalities from the outbreak Ebola in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea, Serra Leone and Liberia are experiencing the Ebola virus outbreak with Liberia claiming the highest figure in the death rate of the three nations in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seriousness of the Liberian emergency was discussed at length during a teleconference yesterday. Those who spoke during the conference relayed by the US Embassy included three US senior government officials, Nancy Lindborg, Assistance Secretary Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance; Donald Lu, Deputy Coordinator for Ebola Response in the US Department of State and Lt. Gen. Steven Hummer Deputy to the Commander for Military Operations, United States Africa Command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officials indicated that Liberia was recording more death rates in the fight against the Ebola virus than any of the three nations that were Ebola hot zones in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the US Government, though its intervention in West Africa focuses Liberia more than the other two countries, Serra Leone and Guinea, the US government was engaging and working with the United Kingdom to beef up support French and English speaking nations to fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said as a result of the US Government commitment to fight against the virus in West Africa and even beyond, the US government was making available $10m to support the Africa Union's decision to mobilize at least 100 health workers on the African Continent to join the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GROWING fears about the spread of the Ebola virus sparked a sell-off in travel stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confirmation that a Spanish nurse has been infected with the deadly disease - the first person outside West Africa to contract Ebola - fuelled worries that airline and other tourism-related companies will be hit by weakening demand for overseas travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of London's travel shares suffered heavy falls. International Airlines Group, the owner of Spanish carrier Iberia, slumped 25.7p, or 6.9pc, to 345.6p, easyJet lost 78p to &pound;13.89 and Carnival, the cruise company, was down 167p at &pound;23.28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, InterContinental Hotels Group slid 85p to &pound;22.44, tour operator TUI Travel closed down 15.3p at 382p and, in the FTSE 250, Thomas Cook declined 6.4p to 112.6p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investors took fright despite JP Morgan analysts reassuring investors that Ebola, which is spread through contact with infected body fluids, was not a &quot;material risk&quot; unless it became airborne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SARS outbreak in 2003 shook airline shares, but investors should not expect Ebola to have the same impact, according to the broker's experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any comparisons with SARS are misplaced, in our view, given that SARS was an airborne illness relatively easy to contract, and balance sheets were considerably weaker at that time from the aftermath of 9/11,&quot; the analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the travel sell-off dragged on the wider FTSE 100, which finished 68.07 points lower at 6,495.58, a 1pc decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor German industrial production data also rattled investors, as did the International Monetary Fund, which cut its forecast for global growth next year. The IMF also warned that &quot;frothy&quot; stock markets were at risk of a correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rio Tinto rose as much as 6.2pc, but ended the day up just 23&frac12;p, or 0.8pc, at &pound;30.20&frac12;, after Glencore, off 8.3p at 331.05p, said that although it had informally inquired about a merger, it was no longer &quot;actively considering&quot; a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American, which has in the past been tipped as a potential target of Glencore, rose 27p to &pound;13.75.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lonmin, the FTSE 250 platinum producer in which Glencore holds a near-25pc stake, added 2.6p to 170&frac12;p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mid-capper has also previously been buoyed by talk that Glencore might make a takeover approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tesco closed up 5.85p at 182.6p following a report that TPG is interested in buying the grocer's Dunnhumby business, the division behind its Clubcard scheme which is valued at more than &pound;2bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cineworld was lifted 9.3p to 329&frac12;p by a show of confidence from chief executive Moshe Greidinger, whose family vehicle, Global City Holdings, lifted its stake to 28.2pc from 26.9pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Cairn Energy was up 3.6p to 183&frac12;p on news that its joint venture off the coast of Senegal had struck oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deutsche Bank analyst Lucas Herrmann said the find was &quot;potentially significant&quot; not just for Cairn but for the broader European exploration and production sector, given it &quot;has been a barren period for conventional exploration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere among the energy shares, oil groups Gulf Keystone Petroleum and Genel Energy, which both operate in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, fell 2&frac34;p to 56p and 14&frac12;p to 793&frac12;p respectively on concerns about the territorial gains made by radical group Islamic State in the country and near the Syrian border with Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staying with the day's fallers, telecoms testing group Spirent - down 21.55p, or 21.8pc, to 77.1p in the FTSE 250 - dropped to a five-year low following a warning that third-quarter revenues would miss expectations, which in turn would hit operating profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;M&amp;A speculation is likely to increase, and to be the main positive catalyst in the short term,&quot; said Investec analyst Roger Phillips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in the FTSE 100, a double downgrade of Schroders by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts knocked the fund manager 55p lower to &pound;22.96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cutting to &quot;underperform&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;, a move that skipped out the intervening &quot;neutral&quot; rating, the experts warned that Schroders would suffer a 16pc drop in profitability if the European Securities and Markets Authority implemented plans to stop asset managers paying for research with dealing commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, a day after Electra Private Equity, 10p cheaper at &pound;25.65, saw off an attempted boardroom coup by activist investor Edward Bramson, attention shifted to the future of his 20pc stake in the investment trust. The shareholding is held by Mr Bramson's Sherborne Investors vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would not be easy simply to walk away and trade out of such a position in the near term without materially impacting the share price,&quot; said Numis analyst Charles Cade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In any case, Sherborne is seeking to deliver gains from the investment, rather than sell out at the current price. As a result, we believe that it is more likely to add to its stake on weakness, rather than to sell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE of the main ingredients of chocolate has become a key barometer of the Ebola epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The price of cocoa beans, the raw material from which chocolate is made, has leapt as outbreaks of the lethal virus threaten to spread across West Africa, which is responsible for 70pc of global cocoa production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three countries most affected by Ebola - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - are not big commodity exporters. But Ivory Coast, which is the world's largest producer of cocoa, shares a border with Guinea and Liberia. The price of cocoa spiked more than 10pc last month on concerns that the virus could spread through the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Ebola epidemic is, of course, first and foremost a human tragedy. As the human toll rises, so too does the risk of the virus spreading further,&quot; said Hamish Smith, a commodities economist at Capital Economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Overall, unless the virus spreads far more widely, the risks to commodity markets should be limited to cocoa and perhaps bauxite.&quot; Signs that the outbreak could move further are likely to be interpreted by markets as a threat to cocoa production, causing the price of the commodity to rise again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and in the GROWING fears about the spread of the Ebola virus sparked a sell-off in travel stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confirmation that a Spanish nurse has been infected with the deadly disease - the first person outside West Africa to contract Ebola - fuelled worries that airline and other tourism-related companies will be hit by weakening demand for overseas travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of London's travel shares suffered heavy falls. International Airlines Group, the owner of Spanish carrier Iberia, slumped 25.7p, or 6.9pc, to 345.6p, easyJet lost 78p to &pound;13.89 and Carnival, the cruise company, was down 167p at &pound;23.28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, InterContinental Hotels Group slid 85p to &pound;22.44, tour operator TUI Travel closed down 15.3p at 382p and, in the FTSE 250, Thomas Cook declined 6.4p to 112.6p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investors took fright despite JP Morgan analysts reassuring investors that Ebola, which is spread through contact with infected body fluids, was not a &quot;material risk&quot; unless it became airborne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SARS outbreak in 2003 shook airline shares, but investors should not expect Ebola to have the same impact, according to the broker's experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any comparisons with SARS are misplaced, in our view, given that SARS was an airborne illness relatively easy to contract, and balance sheets were considerably weaker at that time from the aftermath of 9/11,&quot; the analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the travel sell-off dragged on the wider FTSE 100, which finished 68.07 points lower at 6,495.58, a 1pc decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor German industrial production data also rattled investors, as did the International Monetary Fund, which cut its forecast for global growth next year. The IMF also warned that &quot;frothy&quot; stock markets were at risk of a correction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rio Tinto rose as much as 6.2pc, but ended the day up just 23&frac12;p, or 0.8pc, at &pound;30.20&frac12;, after Glencore, off 8.3p at 331.05p, said that although it had informally inquired about a merger, it was no longer &quot;actively considering&quot; a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American, which has in the past been tipped as a potential target of Glencore, rose 27p to &pound;13.75.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lonmin, the FTSE 250 platinum producer in which Glencore holds a near-25pc stake, added 2.6p to 170&frac12;p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mid-capper has also previously been buoyed by talk that Glencore might make a takeover approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tesco closed up 5.85p at 182.6p following a report that TPG is interested in buying the grocer's Dunnhumby business, the division behind its Clubcard scheme which is valued at more than &pound;2bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cineworld was lifted 9.3p to 329&frac12;p by a show of confidence from chief executive Moshe Greidinger, whose family vehicle, Global City Holdings, lifted its stake to 28.2pc from 26.9pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Cairn Energy was up 3.6p to 183&frac12;p on news that its joint venture off the coast of Senegal had struck oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deutsche Bank analyst Lucas Herrmann said the find was &quot;potentially significant&quot; not just for Cairn but for the broader European exploration and production sector, given it &quot;has been a barren period for conventional exploration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere among the energy shares, oil groups Gulf Keystone Petroleum and Genel Energy, which both operate in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, fell 2&frac34;p to 56p and 14&frac12;p to 793&frac12;p respectively on concerns about the territorial gains made by radical group Islamic State in the country and near the Syrian border with Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staying with the day's fallers, telecoms testing group Spirent - down 21.55p, or 21.8pc, to 77.1p in the FTSE 250 - dropped to a five-year low following a warning that third-quarter revenues would miss expectations, which in turn would hit operating profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;M&amp;A speculation is likely to increase, and to be the main positive catalyst in the short term,&quot; said Investec analyst Roger Phillips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in the FTSE 100, a double downgrade of Schroders by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts knocked the fund manager 55p lower to &pound;22.96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cutting to &quot;underperform&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;, a move that skipped out the intervening &quot;neutral&quot; rating, the experts warned that Schroders would suffer a 16pc drop in profitability if the European Securities and Markets Authority implemented plans to stop asset managers paying for research with dealing commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, a day after Electra Private Equity, 10p cheaper at &pound;25.65, saw off an attempted boardroom coup by activist investor Edward Bramson, attention shifted to the future of his 20pc stake in the investment trust. The shareholding is held by Mr Bramson's Sherborne Investors vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would not be easy simply to walk away and trade out of such a position in the near term without materially impacting the share price,&quot; said Numis analyst Charles Cade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In any case, Sherborne is seeking to deliver gains from the investment, rather than sell out at the current price. As a result, we believe that it is more likely to add to its stake on weakness, rather than to sell.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British fianc&eacute;e of the freelance cameraman who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia has spoken of her anguish at being unable to touch him while he receives treatment in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen Finlay flew to Omaha, Nebraska, to be with Ashoka Mukpo, 33, a British-US citizen, after he was taken there by private plane from the west African nation to receive specialist care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple have been together for four years and had lived in Liberia for two, where Miss Finlay worked for the Open Society Foundation, which promotes human rights and social reform around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told NBC News that due to the highly contagious nature of the virus she was able to speak to her fianc&eacute; only via a video link. Asked how it felt to be able to see but not to touch him, the University of Bristol graduate said: &quot;Heart-wrenching. I mean, when you have got a loved one who is as sick as he is, all you want to do is curl up next to them and tell them it's going to be OK, and obviously I can't do that, so it's hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mukpo had volunteered at an Ebola clinic before starting work with NBC, and told his family he thought he had contracted the disease after being splashed while he spray-cleaned a vehicle in which a victim had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Finlay said Mr Mukpo was aware of how much danger he was in. &quot;He knows how bad it can get, which is making it very hard I think,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cameraman is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Centre, the largest decontamination centre in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mukpo, whose mother is the British aristocrat Lady Diana Mukpo and father the respected intensive care doctor, Dr William Levy, attended the London School of Economics and New York's Columbia University. He had returned to the United States from Liberia in May, staying with his parents in Rhode Island, but told them he wanted to return to Africa to help with the Ebola outbreak there. Mrs Mukpo told NBC: &quot;He just said 'Mum, I'm going tomorrow'. I said 'Please don't go, I'm frightened, you're going to get Ebola'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, NBC's medical correspondent Dr Nancy Snyderman and her team, who were with Mr Mukpo in Liberia when he began developing symptoms, have been allowed to fly back to the US after testing negative for the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors have said that Mr Mukpo's condition is not serious at this stage, although they expect him to worsen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPANISH officials were facing mounting criticism last night over their handling of Europe's first Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They admitted they had still not worked out how a nurse became infected with the virus while working at a Madrid hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission has demanded an urgent explanation from the Spanish authorities of how the infection happened in what was supposed to be a high-security treatment ward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain's health ministry has now put more than 50 people under observation for signs of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse at the centre of the scare was named yesterday as Maria Teresa Romero Ramos, 44, who is believed to have become infected while treating Manuel Garcia Viejo, an elderly Spanish missionary repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other people, including her husband, were placed in quarantine yesterday, while a further 52 health workers have been put under observation by the health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Spanish officials tried to quell public panic, insisting that &quot;all necessary measures were in place to ensure public health&quot;, concerns remained about their failure to identify exactly how Ms Romero had become infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other staff at the specialist isolation unit of Carlos III hospital in Madrid she had been drilled in how to use protective clothing when treating patients, and had apparently only visited Mr Garcia's room twice, once to change his medical nappy and once to clear the room after his death on Sept 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are complying with the established procedure but we are revising all protocols, including those inside the hospital and those outside,&quot; said Rafael Perez-Santamarina, a senior health offi-cial, admitting that the source of the infection was still unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Javier Limon, the husband of the infected nurse, insisted that his wife had stringently &quot;followed regulations&quot; while caring for the missionary priests repatriated with the illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She did everything she was told to, and at no time was she concerned that she could have been infected,&quot; he told El Mundo newspaper in a telephone interview from a hospital isolation ward. Staff at the hospital staged a public protest yesterday, complaining that emergency measures and training on how to look after Mr Garcia and another Ebolainfected priest had not been adequate. They said they had been issued with substandard overalls which were not entirely impermeable, and that they should also have been given breathing apparatus, although medical experts say the latter is not considered essential as Ebola is not airborne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions have also been raised as to why it took so long to isolate the nurse after she began to feel unwell on Sept 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She reportedly contacted health workers to tell them she was suffering from a low fever and fatigue, explaining that she had assisted in the care of the missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not until she presented herself at her local hospital with a high fever early on Monday that she was finally admitted and tested positive for the haemorrhagic virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanish officials also took the extra precaution last night of taking away her pet dog to be put down. There are concerns that the dog could have acted as a carrier of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Romero is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside West Africa, where the virus has claimed nearly 3,500 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak, which began in Guinea in December, has spread mainly to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, but isolated cases have been reported in Nigeria and Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a man tested positive in the US after flying to Texas from Liberia. Thomas Eric Duncan has been in a critical condition at a Dallas hospital since Saturday. He was put on a kidney dialysis machine last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, opposition parties called for the resignation of Ana Mato, the health minister of Spain's conservative government over her handling of the crisis. A European public health safety committee will meet today to review the situation, amid fears that the Madrid outbreak could spread to other countries. Zsuzsanna Jakab, the director of the World Health Organisation, predicted that further outbreaks of the Ebola virus would almost inevitably take place in Europe, given the extensive air links between the European capitals and West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,&quot; Ms Jakab said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passengers travelling from Ebolainfected nations in West Africa currently undergo temperature checks before boarding flights, with anyone registering a thermometer reading of 100.4F (38C) banned from boarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given that the virus has an incubation period of up to three weeks, it is impossible to screen with complete effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some airlines, including British Airways, have suspended direct flights to infected countries, United Nations health chiefs have lobbied for others to remain in operation, arguing that a complete ban on international air travel would hamper the international aid effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the Spanish case, Ms Jakab said a widespread outbreak in Europe was unlikely because of the high standard of health services and public sanitation. &quot;The most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk, and the western part of the European region particularly is the best-prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that she saw no reason yet for screening at Europe's borders of travellers coming from the affected countries in West Africa, despite plans for such measures in the US.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's emergency meeting in Whitehall, chaired by David Cameron, comes after the World Health Organisation said more cases in Europe were &quot;quite unavoidable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers yesterday announced plans to send a humanitarian operation out to west Africa, to treat medics with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest forecasts from US scientists warn of a 50 per cent chance that the virus could reach Britain within three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under NHS contingency plans, protective equipment will be sent to the hospitals in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool, if the need arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operational guidance from NHS England dated last month warned that there were only two high-level containment beds available in the country - both in the Royal Free Hospital - with no isolation units available at all in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Universities and schools have been sent advice warning them to look out for students who have travelled from west Africa showing signs of fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week President Barack Obama indicated that the US plans to screen incoming air passengers for the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said it does not intend to introduce screening for travellers from west Africa, insisting such efforts would be impractical, and mean checks on &quot;huge numbers of low-risk people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said if a case of Ebola was reported in the UK, the affected person would be isolated and protective measures implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHE said the overall chance of the virus entering Britain remained &quot;low&quot; and the country has &quot;robust, well-developed and welltested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, officials said there was a &quot;real risk&quot; the disease could reach Britain, and virologists said the arrival of the virus now appeared &quot;inevitable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the European Commission started an investigation into the actions of the Spanish authorities, and why it was that the Spanish nurse, treating repatriated Ebola patients, was not diagnosed and placed in isolation until a week after she began feeling unwell. The Spanish nurse, 44, contracted the virus after helping to treat two repatriated priests who both died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She reportedly contacted doctors to say she was suffering from a fever and fatigue on Sept 30, but did not present herself to her local hospital for more than one week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Nick Beeching, a senior lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: &quot;With the increasing likelihood of somebody turning up in the UK we have been put on alert in Liverpool and have been making sure the plans are in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: &quot;If the outbreak goes on indefinitely, Ebola will eventually come to the UK. When and exactly how is a tough call. That is an argument for fighting Ebola as hard as possible, right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fight it there, or we will eventually have to fight it here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brian McCloskey, the director of global health at PHE, said: &quot;UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review after the Spanish case. &quot;It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK,&quot; she said. &quot;But what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where it's spreading so rapidly now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army personnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to be part of a humanitarian operation sent to west Africa within the next few weeks. They will staff a field hospital to treat medics with the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Francois, the Armed Forces minister, said: &quot;The Ebola virus represents a global threat to public health and we will not stand idly by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Downing Street spokesman said: &quot;As part of the Government's ongoing efforts to combat the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, the Prime Minister will chair this week's Cobra meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of an ongoing series of Cobra meetings to coordinate the UK response that started in late July and has been in the diary for some time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cameron last night called the president of Sierra Leone to be updated on the situation there, and discussed the use of &pound;125million of UK aid, including support for 700 extra beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Department of Health said: &quot;We are aware of the situation in Spain and are monitoring it closely. This is a reminder that we must support health care workers in maintaining the most rigorous infection control procedures when dealing with Ebola. The NHS has tried-and-tested systems for managing infectious diseases, and we continue to inform clinicians about the signs of Ebola, the need for vigilance and the action to take if they have cause for concern about a particular patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is Ebola? Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe condition which can result in uncontrolled bleeding, causing damage to the patient's vital organs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is it transmitted? The virus is transmitted to people from animals and can spread from human to human through contact with blood and bodily fluids. Contact with objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles has also been linked to the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am I at risk in Britain? The risk to the general British population remains very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I am on a flight with someone with Ebola, what is the risk? You cannot catch Ebola through social contact or by travelling on a plane with someone who is infected, only through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What precautions can I take? It is best to avoid infected countries unless travel is absolutely necessary. If you have to travel, avoid health care facilities unless you yourself suspect you may be infected. Keep an eye on friends or family members who have visited infected areas for signs that they might have picked up the disease. If they begin to show signs of fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, a sore throat or a rash, it is important to avoid physical contact with them or their bodily fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if I think I might have Ebola? If you feel unwell with symptoms within 21 days of returning from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, you should stay at home and immediately telephone 999 and explain that you have recently visited west Africa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she waited for her bus next to an advert urging people to donate money for the fight against Ebola overseas, Elena Felican could only shake her head at how close the threat posed by the virus now felt to her in Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My sister called me first thing this morning, telling me not to go to near the hospital,&quot; said the catering worker. &quot;She told me the patient lived in Alcorcon. How does this happen? It's really scary.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few details have emerged about the first person known to have contracted the Ebola virus outside west Africa. The Spanish nurse, who tested positive on Monday, was part of a team that cared for two elderly Spanish missionaries who both died after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night her husband said she had followed all the regulations. &quot;She did all that they told her to. At no moment was she worried about being infected,&quot; he told El Mundo. The pair had intended to go on holiday, but changed their plans after he injured his leg, he told the newspaper in a phone interview from the room where he has been isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He complained that health authorities had told him his dog would have to be put down because it had been in contact with his wife. &quot;They told me that if I didn't give them my authorisation, they would get a court order and enter the house by force to kill the dog. Then what will they do next? Sacrifice me too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Alcorcon, a city of 170,000 people on the outskirts of Madrid, many wondered just how worried they should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She might have been living in this neighbourhood for days with Ebola,&quot; said Felican. &quot;Did she go to the supermarket? The gym? We don't know anything.&quot; Three primary schools ringed the hospital where the nurse had tested positive, she pointed out, and all of them were open yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her concerns were echoed inside the imposing hospital. Juan Pulido, waiting for his wife to finish her appointment, said his family had urged him not to go. &quot;Every day I sit here, waiting for my wife. I decided today would be no exception,&quot; said the retiree, brushing off their worries. &quot;But it seems like nobody else dared to come - it's empty today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The infected nurse was transported to Madrid's Carlos III hospital late on Monday. She was placed in isolation, as was her husband, who has shown no signs of the virus. Health officials said yesterday they were monitoring 50 more people who may have come into contact with the nurse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities placed a second nurse from the same team in isolation after she complained of diarrhoea. Noting that she did not have a fever, the most common initial symptom for Ebola, doctors said her initial test results were negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities said they had two priorities: compiling a list of all the potential contacts that the woman had before being hospitalised, and determining exactly how she had been infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse had helped care for Miguel Pajares, 75, who was the first person to be repatriated to European soil for treatment in August, but she is thought to have become infected while looking after Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died in Madrid after being evacuated from Sierra Leone two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After complaining of a fever on 30 September, the nurse was told to check herself into hospital if her temperature exceeded 38.6C. Fernando Simon, of Spain's health ministry, acknowledged yesterday that it might have been better to have admitted her to hospital right away despite her not showing serious symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she was admitted on Monday, the nurse remained in a bed in the emergency room, separated from other patients only by curtains, while waiting for her test results to come back, hospital staff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several associations representing health professionals in Spain painted a picture of a healthcare system reeling from cutbacks, drastically underfunded to tackle the challenge of Ebola, and led by a health ministry creating policy on the fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elena Moral, of the CSI-F, a union that represents healthcare professionals, said the delay in admitting the nurse to hospital hinted at deep flaws in the protocol. &quot;A patient suspected of having Ebola and a history of working with Ebola patients should have been put in the first ambulance they could find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She dismissed any suggestion of human error, pointing to a lack of training, infrastructure and safety measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moral also laid blame on the impact of austerity measures on the Spanish healthcare system. &quot;We've been protesting for a long time that the dismantling of the Carlos III hospital could provoke extreme situations like this one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, she said, the Carlos III hospital was closed, gutted of its emergency rooms and then turned into a hospital specialising in tropical diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The repatriation of the two missionaries turned the hospital into something just short of a field hospital. Authorities activated the protocols without keeping in mind the actual state of the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition politicians called on the health minister, Ana Mato, to explain the safety lapses, while around 200 health professionals gathered outside a hospital in Madrid calling for her resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European commission said it had written to Mato &quot;to obtain some clarification&quot; as to how the nurse had become infected. &quot;There is obviously a problem somewhere,&quot; said the commission spokesman, Frederic Vincent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanish health authorities said medics treating Ebola patients in Spain followed the protocols laid out by the World Health Organisation, but their claims were widely disputed. While level 4 protective equipment is required to attend to Ebola patients, healthcare workers in Spain who treated the missionaries had only level 2 equipment, said Juan Carlos Mejias, of Satse, a union that represents nurses. &quot;Level 4 is what's being used in other European countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside Alcorcon hospital, two women working at the hospital gift shop said they knew only what had been reported in the media. &quot;Our co-worker left after her shift last night wondering why there were journalists outside the hospital. Nobody told us anything or warned us that we should be careful,&quot; said one. &quot;At least they could have given us hand sanitiser.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation said yesterday it was ready to provide support for Spain as authorities in the country scrambled to contain the first case of Ebola infection within Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO's European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said it was &quot;quite unavoidable . . . that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;The most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk, and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, David Cameron will chair an emergency Cobra meeting today to discuss the outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, though No 10 stressed it had been scheduled for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In advance of that meeting, Cameron called the president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, to find out what extra help might be needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Downing Street spokesman said the president informed Cameron that the situation &quot;continued to be very serious and they were increasing their response, with a need to train more medical staff, have a better system for servicing treatment centres and improve the burial process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The prime minister said the UK would continue to do all it could to support their efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health England (PHE) moved swiftly to reassure the public that an outbreak of the disease was unlikely. &quot;The overall risk of Ebola to the UK remains low,&quot; the agency said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UK contingency plans for Ebola have always been based on the assumption that there is a low, but nevertheless real, risk of importing a case of Ebola from west Africa. However, it is important to remember that even if a case is identified here, the UK has robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO recommends exit screening for people with unexplained illness leaving Ebola-affected countries, PHE pointed out. Entry screening at British ports and airports is not recommended by WHO, however. It would have to involve screening every returning traveller, because people could travel via a third country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Paul Cosford, director of health protection at PHE, said: &quot;The risk of travellers and people working in affected countries contracting Ebola remains low, but PHE continues to keep border staff and medical practitioners informed, and request they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited these areas in west Africa. As part of contingency preparations, PHE has provided primary care and hospital healthcare workers with the latest information about the outbreak and actions to take in the event of a possible case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Advice has also been issued to UK immigration centres, universities and schools, and humanitarian workers travelling out to affected countries, and the general public. PHE will continue to liaise with the Border Agency and Port Health, and other partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: &quot;UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated. Protective measures would be strictly maintained to minimise risk of transmission to healthcare workers treating the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to remember that for Ebola to be transmitted from one person to another, contact with blood or other body fluids is needed. As such, if England was to see a case of Ebola this will not result in an outbreak here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, one coastguard sector said it would contact ships that had recently been to Ebola-affected countries to ask whether passengers had symptoms of the virus before they were allowed into port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dallas, Texas, Thomas Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed on US soil was in a critical condition last night. Thomas is on a ventilator and a kidney dialysis machine to help stabilise him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration is considering whether to begin extra screenings at airports to check passengers coming from Ebola-stricken countries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Thrasher has found migrants on his roof, in his truck, in his barn. They leave a trail of backpacks and water bottles by the mesquite trees on his land, three miles from the Mexican border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and other ranchers often stumble across migrants, dead or alive. He says he once took a call from neighbours in Hereford, Arizona, who asked him to check out a man sleeping under a bush and making their dog bark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went out there and his eyeballs were picked out and he was deader than a brick,&quot; he said. There was no investigation. Border authorities just came and scooped up the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high desert of Arizona is where border politics becomes a harsh, sometimes sinister experience - one that threatens to unseat two of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House of Representatives standing for re-election in the US midterm elections this November.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans have identified two neighbouring districts in southern Arizona as their best prospect for picking up seats in the House. Both areas have been on the frontline of the long-simmering debate over immigration and the border, which was reignited in the early summer with the surge of tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American children arriving in the US through Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most closely fought seat, Arizona's second congressional district, runs along an 80-mile stretch of the US-Mexico border, and includes Cochise county, where Thrasher lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thrasher, 70, is a cattle vet. He works with about 400 ranchers, keeping him tuned into the political headwinds among rural Arizonans who share their land with drug cartels and human smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past Thrasher has been a vocal supporter of the Democratic congressman, Ron Barber, and his predecessor, Gabrielle Giffords. Recently, however, he led a clutch of ranchers who publicly jumped ship, appearing on a stinging TV advert for the Republican challenger, Martha McSally. &quot;Ron Barber just isn't getting the job done,&quot; Thrasher said in the advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cattle ranchers are not an especially large voting bloc in Barber's district. But in Arizona, which has a growing population of elderly white people from out of state, ranchers in cowboy hats who trace their families back to a time when the land was still Mexico swing a sentimental punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they are hurting the Democratic incumbent. &quot;I've had a lot of compliments,&quot; Thrasher said. &quot;I haven't had one person call me a backstabber or anything else - except for Ron.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking time out of a book-reading event for children in downtown Tucson, Barber, who confessed to being baffled by Thrasher's decision, said: &quot;I said to him, is it because I'm a Democrat and Obama's a Democrat?&quot; Barber told the rancher: &quot;You said I didn't do anything to help secure the border. You know that isn't true.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of why Thrasher and the other ranchers turned against Barber encapsulates the challenge this autumn for centrist Democrats in southern border states. On the one hand they feel under pressure to be border hawks and mollify constituents who say they feel insecure, despite the recent decline in people crossing the border illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, tough talk about clamping down on illegal immigration risks alienating Arizona's growing population of Latinos, who do not want Democrats to take their support for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thrasher says many ranchers are open to some immigration reform. Many have strong connections with Mexico. Some have married into Mexican families. Others employ undocumented migrants on their ranches and would prefer them to acquire legal work status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet while some ranchers are open to providing a legal basis through which people who have entered the US illegally could work, they want the border made safer. As border security has been tightened in recent years, and the flow of migrant workers has declined, routes across the border have been controlled by violent drug cartels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, ranchers say that US customs and border patrols are being mismanaged from Washington, embroiled in a futile battle against drug gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most heavily policed section of the border, near the town of Naco, is protected by 4.5-metre reinforced steel fencing. Beyond the Coronado pass, 10 miles west, the border might as well not exist; it is marked just by a waist-high steel barrier and barbed wire, with gaping holes big enough to wriggle through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much to the annoyance of ranchers, the border patrol has chosen to stand back, using road checkpoints, CCTV cameras, sensors, radar and drones to stalk intruders once they cross the line. Ranchers claim that border agents carelessly drive trucks over pastures in pursuit of the migrants and drug mules, knocking down fences and damaging water pipes, in a tactic which is as inhumane as it is inefficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They let them come across and chase them until they drop. That's what kills a lot of people,&quot; Thrasher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ask Thrasher and the other ranchers why they no longer support their congressman and they struggle to give a clear answer. Jack Ladd, 88, who appeared in the same pro-McSally TV ad, said of Barber: &quot;He's not bad. He listened to us. He did his best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barber is rated among the most independent Democratic congressmen in Washington and has made dealing with border issues his legislative focus. He has saved a crucial radar system that detects light aircraft used by Mexican drug cartels, elbowed himself on to the crucial House homeland security committee, sponsored a series of tough border security bills, and helped get 170 extra customs agents to Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His campaign argues that McSally has failed to even properly articulate her border policies. Yet in repeated interviews in Cochise county, rural voters said that they felt Barber had failed to deliver the thumping rhetoric that constituents expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to the bullish, extroverted Giffords, who resigned her seat after being critically injured in a shooting, Barber has a soft-spoken, bumbling persona. He comes across as considerate and cautious. McSally, the first female US air force pilot to go into combat and a frequent guest on Fox News, is portraying herself as a tough, no-nonsense candidate - a conservative Giffords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All we want is a congressman that can convince people about what is going on down here,&quot; said Thrasher. &quot;(McSally) has got a lot more fire in her belly than Ron does.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 miles north, on the outskirts of Tucson, Barber's middle-of-the road positioning is starting to alienate an arguably even more crucial voting bloc. In the 2012 election Barber beat McSally by fewer than 3,000 votes. Latinos, who lean heavily towards the Democrats, made up an estimated 12% of voters, according to the opinion research group Latino Decisions. That translates to 34,000 votes, more than 10 times Barber's margin of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large Hispanic turnout is a crucial component of Barber's path to victory. Yet in Arizona, as elsewhere in the US, Latino voters feel disheartened by Democrats' failure to make much headway on immigration reform, and by Barack Obama's recent decision to postpone an executive order expected to increase the number of suspended deportations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also say the summer's border crisis fuelled an anti-immigrant sentiment that Democrats have not done enough to distance themselves from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arizona has long been home to some of the most draconian anti-immigrant policies in the US. These include the controversial SB1070, which requires police to determine the immigration status of anyone stopped or arrested if they suspect that person might be undocumented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the law's most prominent backers is the state's House speaker, Andy Tobin. He is the Republican candidate standing against the Democratic incumbent, Ann Kirkpatrick, in Arizona's first congressional district. This is one of the other most hotly contested House races in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobin's primary campaign was dominated by the so-called border crisis. Amid the intense debate over the influx of unaccompanied children, Tobin appeared to warn voters that the children could be infected with Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a campaign stop on a golf course north of Tucson, Tobin backtracked from the Ebola remarks, saying he had used &quot;the wrong word&quot; when raising valid concerns about possibly sick children. But he insisted that border security was still a priority in the midterm elections and the surge in children had fuelled concern over border safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Arizona, it seems the Democratic candidates are most at risk of being burned. Both Barber and Kirkpatrick support comprehensive immigration reform, but both have recently angered Latino voters in their districts by saying that they oppose the idea of the White House taking further executive action on immigration without any congressional support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local observers say that Kirkpatrick has avoided becoming embroiled in the anti-immigrant fervour, but Barber, while remaining committed to comprehensive immigration reform, has succumbed to the pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one hot street not far from Barber's office, three young volunteers of Mexican descent were going door to door encouraging Latinos to register to vote in the midterm elections. They asked that their names not be used, citing the fact they were working for a non-partisan organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know that Ron Barber is the best candidate - that's why we are out here six days a week,&quot; said a 19-year-old woman. &quot;But there's a lot of disappointment with Democrats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hit by iron ore slump and Ebola, miner says rescue plan could leave shares worthless</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">London Mining</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the debt laden West Africa focused iron ore group, has lost nearly 80% of its value as it warned a proposed restructuring could potentially leave shareholders with nothing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has been hit by weak iron ore prices due to oversupply and weak demand from China, along with problems brought by the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said continued to be in talks with strategic investors and its lenders remained supportive, although they were not expected to provide any further short-term funding. That would come from the strategic investors if the talks were successful. But it warned:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no certainty at this time on the likelihood or timing of such an investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the structures currently being proposed, the board believes there will be little or no value remaining in the equity of the company and the other listed securities of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the iron ore price at its lowest level since 2009, the Marampa operations have been put under considerable financial strain. In addition the outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone has introduced significant challenges both to the strategic investor process...and to the ongoing operational performance of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The capital that is needed from such an investor is significant and the proposals currently contemplate funding of the life of mine expansion and a cash injection into Marampa to allow the mine to continue operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news has sent London Mining shares tumbling 2.38p to just 0.72p, and Shore Capital analyst Yuen Low said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing that we didn't know already, but we expect the shares to fall further as a result (despite the drastic decline seen in the last couple of weeks or so).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London Mining also admitted that the regional Ebola outbreak has &quot;introduced significant challenges&quot; both to the strategic investor process (we imagine strategic investors are too afraid to conduct due diligence visits), and to ongoing operational performance (which had previously been reported to be essentially unaffected).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meawhile Numis said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This looks like the end of the road for London Mining unless a new investor charges to the rescue. This seems unlikely but we believe there is value for be had at the asset level for an acquirer to take the project out for a song if it goes into administration, clear out the debt and effectively take the operations off-line to re optimise and wait for prices and ebola to recover.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With economic gloom and Ebola fears again sending markets lower, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tesco</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stands out with another big gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After recording its best day since December 2013 on Tuesday, the supermarket is up 4.7p or 2.5% to 187.3p, the biggest riser in the leading index.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent shock revelation of a &pound;250m black hole had sent its shares to an 11 year low, but talk of a &pound;2bn sale of its data business and a number of boardroom changes have brought a minor revival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HSBC has helped, raising its rating to neutral and raising its target price to 195p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other supermarkets have also moved higher after recent weakness, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">J. Sainsbury</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adding 5.1p to 235.3p and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Morrisons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> up 1.2p to 160.5p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, engineering group </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">GKN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has dropped 10.8p to 294.6p following a downgrade from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which moved from buy to underperform and slashed its price target from 420p to 290p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall the</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> FTSE 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">is down 22.14 points at 6473.44, heading for its year low of 6416 reached in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor German industrial production figures released on Tuesday prompted fears of a recession in the eurozone powerhouse, while the IMF cut its global growth forecasts, adding to concerns about a widespread economic slowdown. Added to that, service sector figures from China earlier on Wednesday showed a dip in growth, while later come the US Federal Reserve minutes from its last meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geopolitical concerns are also hitting sentiment, following the Hong Kong protests, the air strikes on Isis and the situation in Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike McCudden at Interactive Investor said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With global growth fears and concerns over the spread of Ebola topping the agenda, investors are scurrying to safe havens where they can be found. Furthermore, with the technical trend pointing to more selling pressure to come for the FTSE 100, 6380 looks like the next plausible level for some meaningful support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As inflation remains on target the Fed minutes later today may point to another delay to a US rate hike, but any positive sentiment stemming from the US in this session will likely be overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that is the spread of the Ebola virus, which has put pressure on travel shares again. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tui Travel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is down 9.2p at 372.8p while British Airways owner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">International Airlines Group </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">has dipped 0.1p to 345.5p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the mid-caps, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FirstGroup</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has dropped 3.1p to 112p after it announced an inline trading statement but the loss of the ScotRail franchise. John Lawson at Investec said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life never seems to get any easier at FirstGroup as on a day that the group presents a broadly OK pre-close interim management statement, with student and UK bus delivering some encouraging noises (albeit Greyhound is still facing challenging economic conditions), it then announces the loss of the ScotRail franchise. In financial terms, the impact is not too great (mostly around a working capital outflow of around &pound;70m), but this does not help sentiment. A trying stock. We place our target price under review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading index falls for second day but recovers from worst levels as Wall Street rises</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading shares continued their volatile week, falling for the second day running, but ending off their worst levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of the US Federal Reserve minutes and the start of the US reporting season with Alcoa, investors remained concerned about prospects for the global economy in the wake of poor German data on Tuesday and the IMF cutting its growth forecasts. Weak Chinese service sector data did not help matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troubles in Ukraine and Iraq also unsettled the markets, while the spread of the Ebola virus to Spain continued to hit the travel sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with Wall Street edging higher by the time London closed, the FTSE 100 finished 13.34 points lower at 6482.24 after earlier falling as low as 6453. Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day three of the global growth scare sees indices struggling to hold their ground. Bonds have become the destination of choice once again as the equity bull market faces its most serious test in months. The danger is now that a hawkish set of Fed minutes, pointing to an earlier hike in rates, could easily put markets into a tailspin from which they could struggle to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engineering group </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">GKN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost 10.7p to 294.7p following a downgrade from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which moved from buy to underperform and slashed its price target from 420p to 290p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the continuing concerns about the effect any spreading of the Ebola virus could have on the travel industry, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tui Travel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dropped 15p to 367p while British Airways owner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">International Airlines Group </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">slipped 2.3p to 343.3p and cruise company Carnival lost 29p to &pound;22.99.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after its recent slump, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tesco</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recovered 2.5p to 185.1p as analyst Dave Mccarthy at HSBC raised his rating from underweight to neutral and his price target from 175p to 195p.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ITV</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> added 1.4p to 205.8p as Credit Suisse said it could return cash to shareholders, and highlighted than any potential bidder for the broadcaster would have to pay more than 346p a share. The bank put an outperform rating on ITV with a target price of 270p,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the mid-caps, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FirstGroup</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell 5.6p to 109.5p after it announced an inline trading statement but the loss of the ScotRail franchise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Interserve</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the building services and construction group, rose 22.5p to 610.5p after Peel Hunt moved from hold to buy. Analyst Andrew Nussey said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the group's diverse nature leaves us with a few concerns (as does the strategic merit of the acquisition of Initial), we believe that the potential for positive earnings momentum is building. Allied to this, the recent de-rating looks to have been overly harsh as visibility rises. Therefore, with the shares trading on 9 times December 2015 estimates, we upgrade to buy (retaining our 650p target price) in anticipation of a strong finish to 2014. The interim management statement is due on 12 November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Spirent Communications</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell another 5.9p to 71.20p in the wake of the telecoms testing company's disappointing update on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mining sector, platinum producer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Lonmin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> added 2.7p to 173.2p after saying it had returned to full production earlier than expected, following a five month wage strike in South Africa which ended in June. It said output for August and September were higher than the same time in 2013, saying that from August onwards it had achieved production at normal levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lower down the market, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">London Mining</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the debt laden West Africa focused iron ore group, has lost 75% of its value,, down 2.35p to 0.75p, as it warned a proposed restructuring could potentially leave shareholders with nothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of efforts to combat the spread of the deadly Ebola virus which has claimed the lives of many people and leaving several others affected, the District #6 Ebola taskforce recently donated several anti-Ebola materials to the Christian Association of the blind in Paynesville.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation on behalf of the taskforce, the chair person Madam DedeDolopie noted that the donation of the anti-Ebola materials and other items including rice and water amongst others was done as a means of identifying with those who are visually impaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Dolopie said people who are visually impaired stand a high risk of getting infected by the Ebola virus because they do not see people they are coming in contact with something she said poses a serious challenge for visually impaired people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She however promised that the taskforce will do all it could to help the disabled and visually impaired people as the fight against the Ebola virus continues in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items, the head of the Christian Association of the Blind, Mr. BeyanKorta, extended his thanks to the District #6 Ebola taskforce for their thoughtfulness noting that others do not think of the disabled and the visually impaired in such a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Korta said 100 percent of their activities as visually impaired involve touching a situation he said makes them more vulnerable to contracting the virus because they often need others to help them through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the current Ebola situation poses a serious challenge to them noting that their movements are restricted due to the outbreak of the virus which has now become the country's number one enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Christian Association of the Blind asserted that it is very important for anti-Ebola materials to be provided to the disabled and the visually impaired people in the country because they do not have access to the necessary protective equipment to safeguard themselves against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the taskforce also donated some Anti-Ebola materials to residents of the District #6 community in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on behalf of the taskforce during the presentation of the anti-Ebola items to the residents of the district, Mr. Martin Kulah said the taskforce will continue to work to ensure that the spread of the deadly Ebola virus is curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kulah then called on all Liberians to join the fight against the virus and put aside all their political and personal differences and unite in the fight against the virus which he described as everybody's opposition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Abraham V. Corneh of district 14 of Montserrado County has given L$ 200,000.00 to the Association of Private Schools Teachers of District 14 as his own way of identifying with some of those out of job due to the Ebola crisis. In an interview with this paper yesterday, the Association's Public Relation Officer, Anthony V. Kamara, said more than one hundred private school teachers benefited from the lawmaker's kind gesture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kamara added that the lawmaker's humanitarian gesture has assisted several teachers who have been out of job due to the Ebola crisis that the country is now faced with as private school teachers are currently non-functional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;L$200,000.00 was given to the association by our lawmaker to help put food in our various homes. Each teacher benefited about L$ 2000.00.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kamara urged leaders of the district to stop the politics and hold together to help curtail the virus. He appreciated Rep. Corneh for taking such step by assisting teachers in lieu of the prevailing deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE NOTORIOUS CRIMINALS have been alleged to have escaped from the headquarters of the Liberia National Police (LNP) since last week and are said to be at large. The three men are identified as Patrick Kollie, James Harris and Thomas Kamara.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCORDING TO REPORTS, the police were investigating the three men in Monrovia, the seat of the Liberia National Police and while undergoing probe, it was reported that the men allegedly escaped during the early morning hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO DATE, THERE have been no trace of the escapees but reports filtering out of the LNP say, the detainees who were being investigated for multiple crimes could be armed and dangerous because they allegedly escaped without any trace of breakage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MEN WHO are classified as 'wanted' by the security authority in the country were said to have been in police custody for 15 days before their escape from the national headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS MIND-BOGGLING and we demand that the police explain what happened exactly on that early morning that led to the disappearance of the men considered as 'hard core' criminals from their watchful security eyes with their whereabouts unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLICE MUST explain because it beats our imagination to comprehend that with all those security personnel working twenty-four-seven and considering the proximity of the action, the police is brave to even tell the public that the men are dangerous yet again say that they are calling on the public to give information about their whereabouts of any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALL WE ARE saying is that the police must explain what is happening because it sounds like the police are taking the incident as being trivial and forgetting that it puts the safety of the public at risk because those named individuals are said to have committed the acts in Grand Gedeh County and so it is probably possible that nobody in Monrovia might even recognize them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALREADY THE NEWS of Ebola outbreak is frustrating our people and taking a toll on the fragile economy as well as the rising armed robbery cases since the curfew was imposed therefore it is unthinkable that the police cannot use this time to be rigid with the hard core criminals as their sign of joining the fight against Ebola instead they are leashing such individuals out on the public to be confronted with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLICE KNOWING the history of the detainees could not handle just three and that for us, signifies an act of shame on the part of the police and to say that they are still searching for their whereabouts is a sign of weakness and poses a question that needs not just answer but detailed explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLICE MUST explain so that our people can breathe some air of relief because if criminals can escape under the supervision of police at its national headquarters without breaking any part of the holding facility, then what more can we imagine are happening in the counties or rural parts of the country?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with journalists at the presentation ceremony of the mattresses, UEM Executive Director, Iren K. George said, &quot;I am here today to make this presentation in the name of one of our international partners, Mr. Barnard Smith. It is a widow's might&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam George added that it is the beginning of their assistance in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in the country and stated, &quot;I am so grateful to doctors at ELWA for risking their lives to help save others. Thanks for dedication to the people of Liberia in this Ebola crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam George also extended condolence to those who lost their families and loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part the Jonathan Hart said their capacity at the ELWA Unit2 is 40 and they have 64 patients. He said one of their major constraints is &quot;bed&quot; so what was donated by UEM is very essential to them right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Hart said the donation may look small but it is timely and appropriate because they have been overwhelmed by patients and that they are making accommodation with additional rooms that they have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded that it is difficult for one to turn back others and watch them die, and hope this deadly Ebola virus would be eradicated soon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) continues Dr. Billy C. Johnson, one of Liberia's foremost medical practitioners has been giving an outline of food specimen that can help boost ones' Immune system. The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) takes over the DNA and damages the immune system leaving the body without any protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson told journalists yesterday at the regular Ebola News Conference held at the Ministry of Information that as Liberians continue to fight the deadly virus, it is prudent that they eat food that will help boost their immune system and strengthen their body tissues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson said people should eat more foods high in soluble fiber from oats, oat bran, barley, beans (kidney beans, black beans, and chickpeas); apples, strawberries, orange; and vegetables like okra, broccoli, Brussels sprout, carrots, quinoa, green beans and cactus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that people eating more foods containing soluble fiber can help to control their blood sugar, insulin and cholesterol levels, including boosting their energy and help the body fight cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insoluble fiber (does not dissolve in water) --from whole grains, quinoa, oat bran, fruits, beans, vegetables and nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson stressed that insoluble fiber keeps one feel full and regular. He noted that not eating enough insoluble fiber can cause constipation and indigestive problems, such as headache, bloating, heartburn, sluggish, nausea, and weight gain, because of toxic digested wastes clogging ones' colon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said one should incorporate more fiber into their daily meals by choosing fiber-rich foods, instead of fiber supplements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is because fiber-rich foods contain other nutrients like antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and protein that are missing in supplements. You should aim for about 7-10 grams of fiber per meal of which 2-4 grams is soluble fiber. Example of foods high in soluble fiber and insoluble fiber are listed below. Prepare meals around these foods, and you will be consuming enough fiber,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to Liberian dishes, Dr. Johnson recommended that people should eat potato greens, palm butter, palaver Sauce, okra and cabbage as dishes that can better ones' defensive system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson said all fruits, pine apple juice, Butter pear (but not eating the whole on the spot), green plantain lettuce among others can be very helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Medical practitioner however frowned on the regular consumption of local diet such as fufu, saying&quot; Dumboy is better than fufu because it slows down one's blood pressure as it takes time to digest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other food supplements which the doctor highlighted as being more protective at this time of the fight against Ebola include spices especially garlic, rosemary, ginger, turmeric, basil, sage, thyme, oregano, curry spice, red chili pepper and paprika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson stressed that these spices support hormone metabolism and excretion of toxins because of their proteolyticaction and antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical Doctor also advised that people drink lots of water with fresh lemon juice or apple cider vinegar in place of sodas, sugary juices and high energy sports drinks. &quot;Drink 12 to 16 glass of water with lemon juice or apple vinegar first thing in the morning to flush out toxins triggering free radicals. Also drink green tea daily as this facilitates regularity,&quot; Dr. Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson also recommends the drinking of low-sodium vegetable juices like tomato juice and V 8 as they provide antioxidants, fiber and help curb craving between meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson also recommended that people should eat walnuts and add ground flaxseed for essential fat, lignans, selenium, zinc, vitamin E, dietary fiber and phytosterols. However, he cautioned that one control portion eating roughly about one to two table spoon adding to low-fat, low sugar yogurt, cottage cheese, salads or fruit snacks. See Full Text of D. Johnson's deliberation inside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOH&amp;SW) in collaboration with the Ministry of Information has imposed new media policy on how both local and international journalists should cover and report Ebola related stories from health care health care centers in the country, but a Liberian journalist condemns the restriction, saying that such restriction is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the media restriction at the regular press briefing at the Information Ministry on Monday, the Assistant Minister for Preventive Services who also heads the Ebola incident management, Tolbert G. Nyenswah, said the purpose of the policy is to protect the privacy of patients and health care workers and to protect the health and safety of both national and international journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the policy covers all interviews, written or audio-taped as well as video taped, recorded on the grounds of any health care health care facility or outside the facility's perimeter that have been determined to be restricted. Assistant Minister Nyenswah also said no health care worker is allowed to give out information to either local or international journalists without a mandate from the head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister said the restriction is backgrounded on the expansion of the initial Ebola outbreak in Liberia into epidemic as well as the number of local and international news media interested in covering the disease and the significant increased response to the outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said although the government of Liberia supports the public awareness efforts by the media to stop the epidemic, but added that the extensive amount of infections and the extremely contagious nature of Ebola, the safety of those who are good and the care for those who are ill are the most top priority of the nation at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Minister also revealed that journalists desirous of reporting from the health care centers should make their requests in advance to the Ministry before interview permission is granted any journalists at any health care center throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that even if an interview is approved according to the guidance provided in the policy, the health care facility may deny the media access to the facility or cancel the scheduled interview during this epidemic if circumstance should change at the facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his reaction to the Health Ministry's restriction, Mr. Jarkloh, an associate editor of The Analyst Newspaper and media trainer of the Liberia Media Center believes that such restriction contravenes Article 15 (a), (b) and (c) of the Liberia Constitution which guarantees the freedom of the people to information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jarkloh believes that such restriction does no public good than depriving the people the right to know what are transpiring at the treatment and health centers to their relatives and love ones, especially in the face of speculations that patients ate not been properly treated and fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the journalist, the people of Liberia are entitled to knowing what is happening to their relatives and family members taken to health care centers for treatment and should not by any means except for reasons sanctioned in the courts of law through due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 15 (a) states, &quot;Every person shall have the right to freedom of expression, being fully responsible for the abuse thereof. This right shall not be curtailed, restricted or enjoined by government save during an emergency declared in accordance with this Constitution whereas (b) indicates that the right encompasses the right to hold opinions without interference and the right to knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such knowledge, Mr. Jarkloh said includes freedom of speech and of the press, academic freedom to receive and impart knowledge and information and the right of libraries to make such knowledge available. It includes non-interference with the use of the mail, telephone and telegraph. It likewise includes the right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Section (c) of Article 15, it provides that in pursuance of this right, there shall be no limitation on the public right to be informed about the government and its functionaries while Section (e) clearly states that the freedom to information may be limited only by judicial action in proceedings grounded in defamation or invasion of the rights of privacy and publicity or in the commercial aspect of expression in deception, false advertising and copyright infringement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting further, Mr. Jarkloh indicated that there was no such restriction of information contained in the State of Emergency that was wrongly declared by the government, which did not receive two-third vote of the House of Representative as required by the Constitution of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jarkloh, a graduate of the Mass Communication Department of the University of Liberia and graduate student reading Peace Studies at the Kofi Annan Institute for Conflict Transformation called on the media to resist this &quot;ugly restriction&quot; which has no legal or constitutional ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the media, especially the Press Union of Liberia and its auxiliaries, buy this restriction from the government during this crucial time when the media must be free than ever to monitor the performances of state actors including medical practitioners at Ebola centers, more draconian restrictions will follow,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no word from the PUL on the new restriction as an umbrella institution of media outlets in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Medecin Sans Frontier (MSF) through its emergency coordinator in Liberia, Dr. Laurence Sailly, has revealed that 40% out of 100% of Ebola affected patients that were taken to the ELWA-3 Ebola Treatment center have survived from the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the Minister of Information regular press conference in Monrovia, the MSF's emergency coordinator said out of 1,052 patients that are undergoing treatment at his facility, 236 has been discharged from the caring center at the ELWA-3 Center. Dr. Sailly said more than 3,200 people are working with MSF across West Africa to try to bring the Ebola outbreak under control in the sub region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that, MSF has employed 650 Liberian staff and 62 international staff working with them at the ELWA-3 Ebola Management Center in Monrovia and Lofa County respectively. She also added that the MSF has trained 400 community health volunteers to go door to door across Monrovia to share messages on how to prevent the deadly Ebola virus and what to do if a person becomes sick within the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MSF Coordinator also discloses that major adjustment has been made for journalists that are reporting on the virus both national and international. She said they will not allow any journalists to take photograph of patients without their express consent, adding that no journalist or information gathering equipment will be allowed inside the treatment center at ELWA-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1166 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bridgestone Group (Bridgestone) today announced it will donate one million dollars (USD) to critical efforts underway in Liberia and the region to combat the Ebola outbreak. Specifically, $500,000 will be paid to Samaritan's Purse by Bridgestone Americas, Inc. for work in Liberia, while the Bridgestone Corporation will donate $500,000 (JPY 54 million) to support UNICEF's efforts in Liberia and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This $1,000,000 donation follows months of work by Firestone Liberia to manage an effective Ebola emergency response program on its subsidiary rubber farm and nearby communities in country. The funds are aimed at strengthening efforts to stop the spread of Ebola through public awareness; helping facilitate delivery of in-home care supplies for the sick; enhancing medical treatment; and providing support for children left orphaned due to the epidemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firestone Liberia, a Bridgestone Americas subsidiary, has been directly affected by the Ebola outbreak. Since the outbreak hit Liberia, there have been approximately 71 Firestone Liberia employees, family members, retirees and people from surrounding communities who have contracted the virus. The Firestone Medical Center located on Firestone Liberia's rubber farm has been treating patients in its Ebola Treatment Unit, which has helped 17 people survive the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our Firestone Liberia teammates and community have selflessly met the demands of this deadly outbreak and we support them and the great work Samaritan's Purse and UNICEF are doing in the region to help protect the citizens of Liberia and West Africa,&quot; said Gary Garfield, CEO and President, Bridgestone Americas, Inc. &quot;We implore others to step up in taking on this fight against Ebola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know that it will take everyone - every citizen, government official, a health worker and company in the region - to provide the education, resources and supplies needed to stop the spread of this disease,&quot; said Yutaka Yamaguchi, Bridgestone Group's Vice President and Senior Officer, Responsible for CSR and Quality Management, CSR and Quality Management Planning. &quot;More support is needed and we hope others will join Bridgestone in supporting organizations that are on the front lines of this global health crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samaritan's Purse has been working since April to combat the disease through a prevention education program. Its more than 350 staff members in Liberia provide education and direct patient care. The money donated by Bridgestone Americas will be used for the organization's home-based care program which provides Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits to people caring for sick family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thank Bridgestone Americas for its support in the fight against Ebola,&quot; said Franklin Graham, president and CEO of Samaritan's Purse. &quot;Firestone Liberia is working tirelessly to protect and treat the approximately 80,000 people living within its community, and with their support, we're able to broaden those efforts in the larger Liberian community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF's work across the region to contain and control the spread of the disease includes mass education for communities on essential prevention methods, promoting health and hygiene activities, providing medical and other supplies, supporting the government of Nigeria's Ebola Emergency Operations and Care Center and the Liberian national taskforce. UNICEF works with these governments and partner organizations to develop services for families and establish a system to care for the children orphaned by Ebola. The money donated by Bridgestone Corporation will be used to support UNICEF's mass public awareness efforts and work to support orphaned children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current Ebola outbreak is unprecedented and requires an urgent global response. UNICEF is racing against time to control the spread of the disease among children and families,&quot; said U.S. Fund for UNICEF President and CEO, Caryl Stern. &quot;We greatly appreciate the donation from Bridgestone Group, which will help UNICEF expand its critical work in West Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the Firestone Medical Center's Ebola Treatment Unit, Firestone Liberia's emergency response to Ebola includes active case management, investigations, contact tracing, as well as intervention measures and strategies to help protect and care for thousands of people who live in the Firestone community. Part of the intervention strategy is a mass education program which reaches its more than 8,000 employees and approximately 72,000 additional people residing within Firestone's property, as well as many more in the surrounding communities. The company also is working with local government and health officials to help curb the spread of the disease throughout the country. Firestone Liberia is working closely with the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO, among other organizations.</SPAN></P>

In addition to tires for use in a wide variety of applications, it also manufactures a broad range of diversified products, which include industrial rubber and chemical products and sporting goods. Its products are sold in over 150 nations and territories around the world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the National Health workers Association Bong Chapter Martha Morris has described as &quot;a watch hunt&quot; decision by the International Medical Corps to terminate her services at the Suakoko Ebola Treatment Unit. Mss. Morris said the decision against her by the International Medical Corps clearly exposed the insensitivity of the organization in responding to the needs of workers at the Treatment Unit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Medical Crops is the institution managing the Suakoko Ebola Treatment Unit. The group's decision against Martha Morris came as a result of a recent go-slow action by nurses and support staff at the center over salary incentives owed them by the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The workers decided to stop working because they claimed of not being paid their just allowances and lack some tools,&quot; Dr. Sampson Arzuakoi, the head of Bong County Health Team said. The workers told our Bong County correspondent that clothing to protect them was inadequate and there was only one broken stretcher to carry both patients and corpses, increasing the risk of infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a further sign of strained resources, nurses and members of the burial team in the county said the government had stopped paying their wages of US$50 a week. The aggrieved health workers claimed that the International Medical Corps (IMC) - the group managing the ETU - has refused to pay their arrears in the tone of US$ 560 as per their contracts signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the first contractual period with the IMC has elapsed and they want a new agreement signed before resuming work for October. The nurses told Analyst their stance is based on the IMC's decision not to hire them without a formal contract. The workers also complained that despite an agreement with the county health team to provide them food at the ETU, IMC has failed to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the workers' claims, IMC said that the health workers and support staff did not work for 30 days, saying that they have resolved to pay them US$ 350. Bong County Senator Henry Yallah quoting authorities of the IMC told a local Radio Station (Radio Gbarnga) in Bong County Friday that the group agreed to reconsider all other health workers and support staffs who were involved in the go slow with the exception of Miss Martha Morris, the president of the Bong County Health Workers Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Yallah quoted IMC authorities as saying Martha Morris is seeing as a very strong ring leader of protest and therefore could longer make business with her. But Martha Morris in an interview with Radio Gbarnga Friday said she is disappointed in the statement of Senator Yallah and termed the action as watch hunting because of her critical stance on issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it was unfortunate that Senator Yallah and Superintendent Mappy will go public with the findings after their inquiry with the IMC and the aggrieved health workers without informing her. Miss. Morris said the attitude of the two County authorities was unethical and warned Superintendent Mappy and Senator Yallah against politicking professional issues in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, several residents of Bong County have condemned the decision of the IMC and encouraged Martha Morris to remain strong in her advocacy. They told our Bong County Correspondent the decision to layoff the health workers President is an attempt to silence critical voices among the workers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Representative of Montserrado County District #14, Regina Sokan Teah, has donated a consignment of anti-Ebola items to the Ebola Task Force of the Doe the Samuel K. Doe Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consignment includes several dozens of raincoats and rain boots along with several bags of rice for widows whose relatives and loves ones have died as a result of the Ebola Virus Disease at the Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation Monday at the Doe Community Elementary and Junior High School, Mrs. Teah said she was making the donation on behalf of an organization called the Liberia Rebuild Global Team (LRGT) comprising of some Liberians in the United States of America who made the items available for onward distribution to the people of Doe Community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mrs. Teah, the LRGT has decided to react to the news of the Ebola outbreak and the intensity with which the disease hit the people of the Doe Community, adding that members of the group have asked her to identify with the community by making the donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She indicated that following the donation is the launching of the Anti-Ebola Task Force by an Executive of the LRGT which is charged with the task of going from house to house to preach the Anti-Ebola Campaign messages in the community. The Former Montserrado County lawmaker noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We decided not to proceed the usual way by donating plastic buckets; instead we have decided to bring you these rain gear to help the Ebola Task Force reached every house in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Teah averred that the group of Liberians in the diaspora knows that Ebola is real and is here, and is killing our people in the face of continuous denial in Doe Community and in many other communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She challenged the Ebola Taskforce to reach out to the people and make sure that they are accountable to their people, stating that the task force should also liaise with the Ministry of Health And Social Welfare to always report Ebola cases to the relevant authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, an executive of the Liberia Rebuild Global Team residing in Liberia, D. Nanlon Kaina informed residents of the Doe Community that the former representative influenced the decision by which the community was selected for the donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we were making the decision as to where we must go, it was Mrs. Teah that decided to plead your case with us,&quot; Mr. Kaina said. Mr. Kaina further said he would have insisted that the donation be made to the people of Bong County, where he is the chairman of the Ebola Taskforce; but added that knowing the need of the Doe Community residents in the wake of the present anti-Ebola drive they conceded directing the donation to the Doe Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also cautioned the residents to ensure that they preserve their own lives, noting that the group will return to the community in the future to assist the community with different items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is why we don't want the Ebola business to bring us here; but we must be coming here talking about other things different from Ebola that the group should assist them with. He disclosed that the nomenclature of the organization, Liberia Rebuild Global Team suggests that they want to move forward in continuing to render some other help and services to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking at the presentation of the items, the Chairman of the Doe Community Council of Elders, Elder Wleh Davies, thanked the former representative and Mr. Kaina for their generous contributions to the widows and the Ebola Taskforce of the Doe Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Davies said the donation is a true manifestation of generosity of Mrs. Teah and her counterparts in assisting the widows, and making the Anti-Ebola more vigorously and efficiently in spreading out Ebola messages to people at the community level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Medical Officer of John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, Dr. Billy C. Johnson, says the deadly Ebola virus can be defeated in the body when it meets the bodies build up with more protein and other fiber in the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief medical officer of the nation's premier medical center in Monrovia strongly advised against smoking, drinking of hard substance, consumption of excess sugar and other unwanted foods, saying this is leading young Liberians to their early graves. Notwithstanding, the medic indicated that the consumption of fresh and organic foods can help build the immune system of the body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This he told journalists that assembled in the regular press briefing of the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism that the consumption of such food diet would greatly help fight against viruses, especially the deadly Ebola virus that has been claiming lives in the sub-region, including Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday on the nutritional aspect in combating the Ebola virus, Dr. Johnson said fresh and organic foods are additional in the case of diet after the hand washing, saying that eating leafy vegetables and greens every day are highly helpful. Recommending healthy foods that help fight inflammation such as diabetes, hypertension, heart attacks and cancer amongst others, Dr. Johnson said eating soluble foods with fiber are helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He narrated that eating more foods high soluble fiber dissolved in water from oats, oat bran, barley, kidney and other beans including black beans and chickpeas, apples ,strawberries, oranges and such vegetables like okra, broccoli, Brussels prout, carrots, quinoa, green beans and cactus are recommended to build the body's immune system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, eating more soluble fiber can help to control blood sugar, insulin and cholesterol levels, including the boosting of energy and resistance to cancer. &quot;You can eat Spinach, Romaine, Arugula, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Kale Cabbage, Brussels sprouts; you eat 5 to 9 cups daily raw or two and half to four and a half cups steamed boiled daily, he added. Dr. Johnson indicated that the more leafy dark green vegetables eaten daily, the more the body will be able to resist the Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Johnson noted the easiest way in helping the chemotherapy to destroy the Ebola is to eat more vegetables by preparing them in devious soups that you like. He added that defenses against viruses such as Ebola is to enjoy fruits like apple, blueberries, strawberries, banana, grapefruit, papaya (or pawpaw), pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, kiwi, pears, avocado and cherries from two to four serving or more daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Medical Officer of the JFK averred that you have to eat a fruit between breakfast and lunch and between lunch and dinner for a snack. He Johnson recommended eating fruits with protein sources like boiled egg, 1one to two tablespoon nuts like walnuts or a slice of baked or grilled fish. He said an eating variety of fruits has the benefits of different antioxidants and phytonutrients, saying that fruits and vegetable contain antioxidants and phytonutrients that fight the Ebola growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Johnson, who is a Medical Doctor specialized in the field of medicines stated that it is for this reason, you should eat more variety of vegetables and fruits daily. The medical doctor further emphasized his recommendation of eating beans, soybeans and lentils regularly, especially soy foods, soy-milk, tofu, tempeh, TVP-texturized vegetable protein - about half to one cup cooked beans for protein and fiber daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On other nutritional foods in combating the deadly Ebola virus, Mr. Johnson furthered suggested the eating grain cereals, rice, pasta, breads, and crackers like brown rice, quinoa, barley, or Barilla pasta with tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic, onions, spices and lentil a few times weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, warned against the constant consumption of fufu, something he said no impact on the human immune system to fight against any disease. The chief medical officer warned citizens to also avoid too much raw meat, but rather preferred more fish due to the omega-3 fatty acids that can help fight inflammation and cause damage to cancer growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fufu has nothing to offer to the body; it can only provide more infections in the human immune system that may lead to growth and can kill a person slowly,&quot; he further warned. He added that the body must contain in it extra virgin olive oil, cold-pressed canola oil, or flaxseed oil to be able fight any disease or virus, it. &quot;You should not hesitate to have adequate healthily fat food in your meals; your body needs them to fight inflammation in the blood vessels and tissues,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Dr. Johnson said the outbreak of the deadly virus in the country has made Liberians to know how to put together food that will help to build their immune system against any unhealthy virus or disease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia is in desperate need of someone to take charge of the fight against Ebola. Liberia's ambassador to the UK, Rudolf von Ballmoos, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. &quot;We're having help from all over the world, I must say, and for this we are extremely grateful,&quot; he said, adding that the U.S. military, the U.N., Germany, Norway, and others have all stepped in to assist the fledging Liberian ministry of health.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... We will need - proper coordination. Who is taking instructions from who? That's something we have to sit and coordinate it properly. That's what Liberia is looking for.&quot; Liberia has been by the far the worst hit by the Ebola epidemic, with 2,069 deaths, according to the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 3,431 have died across Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, with the vast majority concentrated in the first three.Shockingly, there were only 50 doctors in Liberia just before the outbreak started, according to Reuters, for a population of just over four million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's even better than ... when President Sirleaf got in,&quot; Ballmoos said. &quot;When President Sirleaf got in, we had seven doctors - practicing Liberian doctors.&quot; U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged hundreds of American military personnel to bolster the response, though the operation has reportedly been slow to get off the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the CDC is warning that &quot;without additional interventions or changes in community behavior,&quot; there could be as many as 1.4 million cases by the end of January. &quot;The fact that the Americans are coming here is a sign of relief. But however we cannot rest on our laurels on that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot just sit and fold our arms and say, aha, the Americans are here. We can't do that. So what we're doing, we are being innovative the best way we can until the Americans actually get on the ground.&quot; He gave an example of a nursing student who improvised simple sanitary devices to protect herself and save her family from the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ebola situation is very capital intensive.... We all know Nigeria has the finances to do it on her own. We don't.&quot; &quot;We are coming out of a disastrous situation of fourteen years,&quot; he said, referring to the country's civil wars, which ended in 2003. &quot;The world knows that. We were trying to climb out of the situation bit by bit, and then Ebola comes on. What do we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to continue ... awareness campaign.&quot; &quot;That message, it's now being sold throughout Liberia. The communities, at a community level, they're all getting the message slowly but surely. We've trickled it down to kids, to everyone.&quot; &quot;We had a major problem of, first of all, not accepting that Ebola exists. Now they are accepting it. Now they're trying to be careful in self-hygiene, washing your hands properly. These are simple methods.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SPANISH nurse has tested positive for Ebola in what is the first case of the deadly virus being contracted outside of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The woman, whose name has not been made public, has tested positive in two initial tests, health authority sources told local media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Spanish nurse presented herself to a hospital near her home in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon with a high fever yesterday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that she was part of the medical team that treated Manuel Garcia Viejo, a Spanish missionary priest who died of the virus at a Madrid hospital less than a fortnight ago after being evacuated from Sierra Leone. Mr Garcia Viejo, 69, died from Ebola on Sept 25, four days after being repatriated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first Spanish victim of Ebola was another priest, Miguel Pajares, 75, who died on Aug 12 despite receiving the experimental ZMapp drug while being treated at Madrid's Carlos III hospital after being repatriated from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both priests were members of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios, a Roman Catholic group that runs a charity working with Ebola victims in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spain's ministry of health called an emergency meeting yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The woman arrived at the University Hospital in Alcorcon suffering a high fever,&quot; a ministry of health source told Spain's daily El Mundo newspaper. &quot;The first test came back positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hospital where the woman was being treated launched emergency protocols for dealing with contagious diseases. Meanwhile in America, the US-British cameraman who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia arrived by private plane for treatment at the Nebraska Medical Centre in Omaha, the largest biocontainment hospital in the country. Ashoka Mukpo, 33, is thought to have become infected when he was splashed as he spray-cleaned a vehicle in which a victim had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His mother, Diana Mukpo, who went to school with the Princess Royal and now runs a dressage centre in the US, and father, Mitchell Levy, a leading doctor, spoke of their relief that their &quot;strongwilled&quot; son was receiving treatment. Dr Levy said he had told Mr Mukpo he was &quot;crazy&quot; to go to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A graduate of the London School of Economics, Mr Mukpo had been working for an NGO for two years in the west African nation before returning home to the US state of Rhode Island in May. He went back to Liberia last month, against his parents' wishes, in order to volunteer at an Ebola clinic, only to contract the disease last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked how Mr Mukapo was feeling, his mother said: &quot;He's enormously relieved to be here. He's still quite frightened but he is hanging in and he shares in the relief of his family that he is able to come back for good medical care here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current Ebola outbreak is believed to have infected about 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 deaths in west Africa, according to estimates by the World Health Organisation, with Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea the worst hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ebola virus is not airborne and can only be spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids - blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva or semen - of an infected person who is showing symptoms. It causes fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes internal and external bleeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse in Spain has tested positive for the Ebola virus after treating a patient repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone, the first reported case of someone infected with the virus outside west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse was part of the team that treated a Spanish missionary with Ebola who arrived back in Europe two weeks ago. The 69-year-old missionary, Manuel Garcia Viejo, died on 25 September, four days after being taken to Carlos III hospital in Madrid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse arrived at a hospital in Alcorcon with a high fever yesterday, and two round of tests proved positive for the deadly virus, Spain's health minister, Ana Mato, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first missionary to be repatriated to Spain was 75-year-old Miguel Pajares in August. He also died in Madrid. His return prompted concern among health professionals who said that Spanish hospitals were not adequately equipped to handle the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amyts, a trade union that represents doctors, called the repatriation risky, and its president, Daniel Bernabeu, asked Spanish news agency Efe if &quot;anyone could guarantee 100% that the virus wouldn't escape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernabeu contrasted Spain with the US and pointed out that the Americans had 10 hospitals with the highest level of biosafety possible. Spain, in contrast, has just one suitable hospital with biosafety levels that are much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fifth American to contract Ebola in west Africa arrived in Omaha yesterday morning, as the first patient diagnosed with the disease in the US was fighting for his life in Dallas. A specially equipped plane carrying Ashoka Mukpo, an American journalist who contracted Ebola while covering the outbreak in Liberia, landed at Eppley airfield in Omaha. Mukpo was taken to the Nebraska medical centre, where he will be treated in a biomedical isolation unit - the largest in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukpo was working in Liberia as a freelance cameraman for NBC News when he tested positive for Ebola last week. As a precautionary measure, the NBC news crew he was working with will remain in isolation for 21 days, the incubation period for the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile in Dallas, Thomas Duncan's condition worsened over the weekend, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Thomas Frieden. Duncan, from Liberia, is in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, which announced on Saturday that his condition had changed from serious to critical. He was diagnosed last Tuesday and placed in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days earlier, he had gone to the hospital complaining of symptoms similar to Ebola, and told the on-duty nurse that he had travelled from Liberia. This information was not relayed to the prescribing doctor, who sent the man home with a course of antibiotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case prompted the CDC to update its guidelines for hospitals receiving patients who are displaying symptoms of Ebola, which can include high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials in Dallas are monitoring 50 people they believe may have come into contact with Duncan before he was isolated, the majority of whom are of very low concern. Nine people are considered high risk, among them his girlfriend and her family, with whom he was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has ruled out a ban on travellers from countries most affected by Ebola but is reviewing possible additional passenger screening measures, the White House said yesterday.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse in Spain has tested positive for the Ebola virus after treating a patient repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone, the country's health authorities said yesterday. The nurse is thought to be the first person to have contracted the virus outside west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auxiliary nurse was part of the team attending to a Spanish missionary with Ebola who was repatriated two weeks ago. Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, died just four days after being brought to Madrid's Carlos III hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities said last night that the nurse was in stable condition. She had alerted them to a slight fever on 30 September, said Antonio Alemany from the regional government of Madrid, and checked into a hospital in Alcorcon with a high fever on Sunday. Ebola protocol was immediately activated at the hospital and initial and secondary tests were both positive for the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patient, who is married with no children, was on holiday when she began showing symptoms, said Alemany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're drawing up a list of all the people she may have been in contact with, including with health professionals at the Alcorcon hospital where she is being treated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, the nurse also treated 75-year-old Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares who had been repatriated to Madrid from Liberia. Pajares, who died from the virus five days after arriving in Madrid, was the first patient in the current, fast-spreading outbreak to be evacuated to Europe for treatment. The decision to bring him to Spain prompted concern among health professionals who said that Spanish hospitals were not adequately equipped to handle the Ebola outbreak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amyts, a trade union that represents physicians, called the repatriation of Pajares risky. Its president, Daniel Bernabeu, contrasted Spain with the US and pointed out that the Americans had 10 hospitals with the highest level of biosafety possible. Spain, in contrast, has just one suitable hospital and even its biosafety levels were much lower than in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fifth American to contract Ebola in west Africa arrived in Omaha yesterday morning, as the first patient diagnosed with the disease in the US was fighting for his life in Dallas. A specially equipped plane carrying Ashoka Mukpo, an American journalist who contracted Ebola while covering the outbreak in Liberia, landed at Eppley airfield in Omaha. Mukpo was taken to the Nebraska medical centre, where he will be treated in a biomedical isolation unit - the largest in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukpo was working in Liberia as a freelance cameraman for NBC News when he tested positive for Ebola last week. As a precautionary measure, the NBC news crew he was working with will remain in isolation for 21 days, the incubation period for the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dallas, Thomas Duncan's condition worsened over the weekend, according to Thomas Frieden, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director. Duncan, from Liberia, is in isolation at a Dallas hospital, which announced on Saturday that his condition had changed from serious to critical. He was diagnosed last Tuesday and placed in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days earlier, he had gone to the hospital complaining of symptoms similar to Ebola and told the on-duty nurse that he had travelled from Liberia. This information was not relayed to the prescribing doctor, who sent the man home with antibiotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case prompted the CDC to update its guidelines for hospitals receiving patients who are displaying symptoms of Ebola, which can include high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health officials in Dallas are monitoring 50 people they believe may have come into contact with Duncan before he was isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has ruled out a ban on travellers from countries most affected by Ebola but is reviewing possible additional passenger screening measures, the White House said yesterday. Spokesman Josh Earnest said: &quot;We remain confident that we can keep those travel channels open.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news that a nurse in a Spanish hospital has been infected with the Ebola virus by a patient will greatly dismay those trying to reassure the public in Europe and the US that they are safe from the disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should not happen. In countries with sophisticated healthcare systems, such as Spain and the US, it ought to be almost impossible for a nurse to become infected once the hospital is aware that it has an Ebola patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Dallas, ambulance workers were put at risk and are now in quarantine because of ignorance: the hospital did not know that Thomas Duncan might be infected when they responded to the call to transport a sick man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Spain there does not seem to be that excuse. The priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, whom the nurse was helping to treat had been repatriated from Liberia precisely because he had Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The virus is transmitted from one person to another through bodily fluids and the sicker the patient becomes, the higher the levels of virus. The sick are more dangerous to people nursing them than to almost anybody else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, strict infection control procedures work in the challenging circumstances of west Africa most of the time and should not fail in Europe. Any nurse, doctor or anyone else who has contact with a patient must be in a protective suit, complete with gloves and face mask. The patient will be in isolation and strict hygiene and sanitation measures will be in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the urgent questions now facing the Spanish health authorities will be whether the nurse treating the priest might have removed or failed to put on any part of this protective clothing. Experts will hope there is a rapid answer to that, because there is a real danger otherwise that scare stories, without any scientific evidence, will circulate on the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists and doctors have repeatedly said that Ebola is not transmitted through water droplets in the air from coughs and sneezes. It will be important now to ascertain exactly what happened in Madrid so that any such rumours can be quickly scotched.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the economy what done it. That, and Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A combination of bad news from the latest data and the spread of the Ebola virus to Spain sent shares tumbling once more. Things could have been worse, if not for takeover action in the mining sector which helped to limit the damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FTSE 100</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> finished down 68.07 points at 6495.58, with travel companies falling sharply on the virus news, on the basis that travel restrictions could be enforced, even supposing people want to leave their own countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the economic front, sentiment was hit by a shock 4.0% month-on-month drop in German industrial production in August, compared to a forecast fall of 1.5%, raising the prospect of recession in the eurozone powerhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later came news the International Monetary Fund had cut its global growth forecasts. It now expects world growth to be 3.3% in 2014, down 0.1% from its July forecast, and 3.8% in 2015, down 0.2% from three month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also the continuing geopolitical tensions to unsettle investors: the protests in Hong Kong, the troubles in Ukraine, not to mention air strikes on Isis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mining shares were in focus after news that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Glencore</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, down 8.3p at 331.05p, had approached </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Rio Tinto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, up 23.5p at 3020.5p, about a merger.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screens [were] still flashing red across financial markets thanks to growth fears, but bargain hunting has allowed markets to rally off their lows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Price action on the FTSE 100 today would have been a lot uglier were it not for some fortuitous M&amp;A news among the miners. The sector, perhaps one of the handiest gauges of global economic expectations, has seen several false dawns with the summer slump being the ugliest, but the prospect of a flurry of deal-making would be just the ticket to draw attention away from the ongoing decline in commodity prices. Glencore's move is particularly brave given the apparent shift to divestment of non-core activities that has been a trend among big miners, but it is a typically gutsy move from a firm that has a reputation for standing out from the pack. Meanwhile airlines and other travel firms have been aggressively sold on fears that Ebola concerns will lead to a round of travel restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Tesco</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> jumped 5.85p to 182.60p on reports that a fifth executive was to leave after the discovery of its &pound;250m black hole, and that private equity firm TPG was considering a &pound;2bn bid for the supermarket's data analysis and Clubcard business Dunnhumby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the mid-caps, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Cairn Energy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> climbed 3.6p to 183.5p after it said a joint venture had discovered oil at a well off Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Spirent Communications</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slumped 21% to 77.1p after the telecoms testing group said it expected only a small rise in third quarter revenues as business in the US and China remained subdued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Asos</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dropped 7% to &pound;20.61 as investors took profits following Monday's suggestion by analysts at UBS that Amazon could pay up to &pound;50 a share for the online fashion retailer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Ebola virus outbreak in the country continues to create concerns among Liberians here and abroad, Professor Yaya Bruce of Devry University, Pennsylvania, United States of America over the weekend donated rice and some hygienic materials to the people of Millsburg in Montserrado County.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting the items to the citizens on behalf of Professor Bruce, Attorney John S.

In view of the aforementioned, he indicated that the Professor donated 8 bags of 25kg rice, 4 cartons of Clorox and 4 cartons of tile soap as her own way of contributing to the Ebola fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the people that the Professor has not forgotten them. &quot;I have my people on my mind,&quot; she intimated. He however pointed out that Madame Bruce asked him to admonish the people to always take into consideration those pieces of advice from the health workers to avoid being infected by the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the donated items, Gordon L. Cisco, Commissioner of Millsburg expressed thanks and appreciation to the donor for those items and indicated that it would buttress the fight against the pestilence which he said was raging havoc on the lives of his people. The Commissioner promised that every item received will indeed be used for the intended purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Rev. Thomas Mitchell, former Principal of Millsburg Public School also lauded the efforts of Professor Bruce which he described as strategic for the battle against the Ebola virus. He said when they got the news that the Professor has sent some things for them, the citizens were filled joy. According to him, they said they will always pray for her. Rev. Mitchell however hoped that the disease will be defeated so that the earlier plan of reunion with Professor Yaya Bruce can take place in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">470 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Government has reportedly suspended Liberia's diplomatic Missions Accounts at PNC Bank in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic sources hinted The News that the decision was taken recently following allegation of money-laundering activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our sources said that the accounts were ordered suspended by the U.S. government after it had monitored movements and transactions associated with the accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our sources, the U.S. government is concerned about huge money trail and deposits into that account which appears difficult to track at time. Our sources said the U.S. government reportedly uncovered that some huge amounts go to individual accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Liberia's Ambassador accredited to the United States, Jeremiah Solunteh, was contacted for comment, he could not deny nor confirm the story but requested for time to enable him ask some members of his staff for details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Solunteh said he could not comment on the development because he had been attending the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister for Public Affairs, Bobby Willie, when contacted, denied the story and indicated that all of the country's diplomatic accounts are functional and none of their accounts have been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, the United States government froze the bank accounts of the Liberian Embassy in Washington DC along with forty-nine embassies, 30 from Africa and 20 coming from outside of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Chief of Mission at the Liberian Embassy in Washington DC, Edwin Sele, confirmed at the time that the country and forty-nine other foreign embassies bank accounts were frozen by the United States government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Deputy Chief of Mission said the freezing of the Liberian embassy's bank account was not only unique to Liberia, adding that it is a broader action taken by the United States government against countries with huge influx of money into their embassies account with excessive expenditure which the United States government cannot track; how and for what money expended for and who receiving it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in an effort to expedite support for the fight against Ebola, the Embassy of Liberia in Washington, D.C. has established a bank account at PNC Bank. The account is titled: Embassy of Liberia Ebola Account. Account Number: 8628908109. Routing Number: 031000053.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A piece of information posted to the embassy web page indicated that those wishing to make donation should deposit directly at a PNC bank or branch. It said that cash deposit or check payable should be made to &quot;The Embassy of Liberia Ebola Account&quot; as mentioned above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the Government of Liberia has established the Ebola Trust Fund at the Central Bank of Liberia. Interested individuals are asked to make contribution(s) through the account number below. The account number is as follows: 022530000215.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">414 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh has departed the country ahead a small Liberian delegation to Washington, DC on Monday, 5 October, to participate in the upcoming annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting comes at a time when Liberia is experiencing the worst ever outbreak of the &quot;Ebola Virus Disease&quot; (EVD), which has claimed more than 1,800 lives, posing further risk of exposure to the larger population and a severe impact on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in the US, Konneh, who is being joined by the Governor of the Central Bank of Liberia, Dr. Mills Jones is expected to hold series of multilateral and bilateral discussions aimed at rallying support for the government's &quot;National Ebola Response Strategy,&quot; the overall efforts to contain and defeat the disease and resource mobilization to address the potential economic impact of the Ebola virus on the Liberian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian delegation is expected to play a key role in a special &quot;Ebola Roundtable&quot; involving the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, the World Bank President Jim Kim, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, and a host of development partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will hold separate meetings with key partners financing existing infrastructure projects in a bid to ensure funding and implementation of these activities are not adversely affected by the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since it emerged in March 2014, the Ebola outbreak has seriously affected economic activities throughout the country, with concession companies scaling down their operations as expatriates depart the country for fear of the EVD and a general decline in the real sector of the economy and commerce, affecting livelihoods across the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An MFDP press release quotes Minister Konneh as saying &quot;economic growth is projected to slow by more than 85%, from 5.9% to 1%, exacerbating the already volatile youth unemployment outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konneh: &quot;Our immediate priority is mitigating the immediate impact of the outbreak by financing the budget to keep our development agenda on track, but in the medium to long-term we will also aim to secure financing for a comprehensive post-Ebola economic recovery plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the Liberian government and its partners announced it would require roughly US$375 million to effectively fund its National Ebola Response and Restoration of Basic Health Services strategy in addition to support already provided by different international organizations on the ground.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of Logistics Management Information Services (LMIS) at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Kpakama Kromah said the hub has started a detailed distribution of PPEs and other supplies to ETUs, hospitals and health across the Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the supply of materials to a particular location or ETU is done on the basis of the number of health facilities in that location and number of beds in an ETU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kromah said the movement of logistics to various locations ETUs and health facilities especially in the counties remain a challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hub Manager at the World Food Programme (WFP), Soren Grovald said plans are being worked out for the construction of additional logistics hubs in other parts of the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">955 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will respond positively to any request for legal representation of Mr. Thomas Duncan if the Government of Liberia decides to prosecute him&quot; says Attorney Samuel Kofi Woods, II, Liberia's foremost human rights lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Woods was responding to inquiries by some Liberians during his recent visit to Atlanta where he was invited to speak at a forum organized by the Carter Center and the Emory University's schools of Ethics and International Development Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian Government has announced that it would prosecute Mr. Duncan in court for knowingly taking the virus to the US.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods told the anxious crowd of Liberians and Americans that it would be premature at this stage to discuss the innocence or guilt of Mr. Duncan as to whether Duncan knowingly and deliberately planned to mislead authorities; when he answered &quot;no&quot; to questions whether he had contact with Ebola patients, noting that he would rather at this time focus on proper legal representation, and Mr. Duncan's rights to free and fair trial and the guarantees of due process. This is also not an attempt to justify any action of Mr. Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the appropriate time and when necessary we will review all of the factual circumstances and deal with the legal issues; not sentiments, emotions and brinkmanship, Woods declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights lawyer also expressed the hope that the government's pronouncement of its intention to prosecute the ailing Duncan, if he survives and returns to Liberia is not just another move to pander to the International Community and particularly the US Government. Woods said he hopes that by this new found desire and willingness to prosecute, that the Liberian Government is now ready to end impunity and proceed to demonstrate respect for the rule of law and address previous cases of neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also described the government's response to the Ebola epidemic as woeful, inadequate, and disjointed; emphasizing that in the event that the government proceeds with this case, &quot;we will assemble the best legal team to put the Liberian government on trial, for failing the people of Liberia, rather than Mr. Duncan, a victim of institutional neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know too well the trail of the countless display of wholesale impunity, complicity, neglect and abuses that have occurred recently and over the years under the watchful eyes of this Government. The list is endless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods noted, &quot;I have said repeatedly that we continue to commit moral sin and ethical transgression against the poor and weak. It is the poor, weak and powerless that are vulnerable to the caprices of our governments. We ignore their needs and demands, we reward their abusers, turn a blind eye to the theft and abuse that deprive them of basic social services including health care, yet we are anxious to punish them, even before we gather all the facts. This must stop!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods noted that the current situation in Liberia is primarily a health emergency and primacy must be given to the health expert to deal with such situation. What has been the response to assure Liberians and the world that we are serious? Have we conducted the relevant testing, contact tracing, isolated those who came in contact with Mr. Duncan and invoke health regulations. We must announce measures that will re assure our population and give them hope rather than rush to judgment. This is the mistake we continue to make by overzealousness and ego desires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods said he hopes the Liberian Government will answer these critical questions before pronouncing or proceeding with a prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Atty. Woods has maintained that Ebola is a Global tragedy and requires urgent and decisive global action, noting, &quot;It has no border, sees no race, color or religion. It is a ferocious enemy seeking to devour the human race and it can only be stopped by the collective action of everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods then reiterated his appeal for a more sustainable engagement to eradicate the virus, emphasizing a number of actions including the need to design and develop a contemporary comprehensive health plan and strategy, upgrade Liberia's antiquated health system and review, realign and account for donors' assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed the need to increase treatment centers, access and ensure quick testing and diagnosis, provide the population with personal protective equipment (PPE's) so they can be able to care for relatives, clean and disinfect their environments and protect themselves as they await the intervention of healthcare workers, set up mobile clinics, provide more ambulances to transport patients to health centers and design a strategy to de-stigmatize the virus and people afflicted by the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atty. Woods wants government address the needs of child and adult survivors and orphans of the virus, establish regional and national infectious disease Institutions in the region that will predict and respond quickly to this situation in the future and review and develop a new consensus on our national political and governance system overall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also commended the international community for its support but urged urgency. He also praised President Obama for &quot;pledging whatever federal resources were necessary to treat Mr. Duncan and ensure that the virus will not spread&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Attorney Woods is stressing the need to celebrate and acknowledge local initiatives by citizens, civil society organizations, religious institutions and the work of Drs. Brown and Logan. These are our national heroes and the fight against this virus will have to be sustained by their tirelessly commitment and sacrifice. He paid tribute to all who have fallen victim to the virus especially our health workers, families, relatives and caregivers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Solomon Juah, Senior Pastor of the Refuge Baptist Church has disagreed with religious leaders who have said that the Ebola outbreak is a wrath from God.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Juah said the outbreak is not spiritual and cannot be a plague from God. He indicated that the outbreak is part of natural phenomenon, noting &quot;if it was a pestilence for Liberia then why is it in Sierra Leone and Guinea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Juah said the disease is a fulfillment of the prophecy made by Jesus Christ that in the last days there will be pestilences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described individuals who have claimed that they can lay hands and lay down with Ebola patients as 'religious criminals'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not saying that you can't pray. You can pray for God to give you strength to adhere to measures the medical people have introduced,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he cannot participate in a weeklong fast and prayers reportedly announced by the Liberia Council of Churches because he does believe in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Juah alleged that there are some churches in the country, which are workshops of the devil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also added that &quot;we do not participate in these kinds of things because we don't consider them as Christian, these are deceivers and politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">556 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Christina Tah has made her March 31, 2014 letter of resignation public and urged President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to accept her decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported in March this year that Minister Tah has resigned her post, following her suspension by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's action was in keeping with Section 34.20 read in concert with 34.2(d) of the Criminal Procedure Law ILCL Revised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference Monday, Minister Tah confirmed media reports that she resigned since March 31, 2014, but President Sirleaf had delayed to acknowledge her resignation for reasons best known to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On July 11, 2014, I formally notified President Sirleaf by letter that I had completed the six-month suspension imposed by Supreme Court on my license to practice law and that the Court had ordered that I resume practice. She responded immediately, asking me to return to work and indicating that we will discuss my letter of resignation of March 31, 2014 at a later date,&quot; she told news men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Minister Tah noted that out of deference for the Office of the President and in view of the national security crisis posed by the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease, she obliged and continued with her schedule of duties, awaiting President's convenience to ratify her longstanding decision to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said in the interim of good faith and in anticipation of the follow up discussion about her resignation which the President had promised, she was shocked and dismayed by a statement by Information Minister Lewis Browne that the parody of justice in the contempt proceedings against her and Counselor Beyan D. Howard as a classic example of judicial independence and equality before the law, irrespective of social class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, the copious press release was disseminated without the commonplace collegiality of informing her ahead of time and failed to acknowledge her pending resignation notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She indicated that the ceremonial appeared to be aimed at a preemption and/or retaliation of the prerogative to resign, which she sought to exercise nearly four months earlier. Minister Tah: &quot;My fellow citizens, as difficult and as painful as it has been for me to be objectified into a lightning rod for controversial claims about the rule of law, I was willing to subordinate my grievances to the best interest of our dearly beloved nation, to bite the bullet and to count it all in a day's work as the saying goes.&quot; Cllr. Tah noted that she was particularly appalled that the Government chose to announce its reaction to her matter with the Supreme Court given that the nation was at the height of its fight against the Ebola Virus Disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said it has become unbearable to her to persevere in name as the dutifully appointed Minister of Justice of the Republic of Liberia when in reality concrete actions indicate a determination to systematically undermine and gut the portfolio of relevance and effectiveness. Cllr. Tah noted that landscape of the Liberian jurisprudence is being transformed in arbitrary and inscrutable ways that make it onerous to conscientiously navigate amidst the prevailing interpretation of the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sources in the corridor of power told the News that there are other reasons for her resignation apart from those mentioned in the letter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ashoka's Mukpo's British fianc&eacute;e has flown from London to await his arrival at the Nebraska Medical Centre's biocontainment unit, along with his British mother, Diana Mukpo, and his American father. Dr Mitchell Levy. Mr Mukpo, 33, who has dual citizenship, was working for NBC News. He is the second British person to contract Ebola during the current outbreak in west Africa, which has so far claimed more than 3,400 lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Pooley, a volunteer nurse, contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and was successfully treated at the Royal Free Hospital in north London last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing how he learnt of his son's illness in a text message, Dr Levy said: &quot;My heart sunk. He said: 'Dad pick up your phone. Answer the phone. I think I'm in trouble'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Levy told the Providence Journal his son's fianc&eacute;e, Helen, &quot;feels for Ashoka. They love each other very deeply&quot;. He added: &quot;They don't have a glass panel [in the biocontainment unit] so they set up cameras in the room. He'll know we're there. He'll see us on a monitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Dallas, Texas, the first person diagnosed with Ebola on US soil was &quot;fighting for his life&quot; after his condition deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who fell sick with the virus after arriving from Liberia, was in a &quot;critical&quot; condition at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Tom Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC), said: &quot;We understand his situation has taken a turn for the worse.&quot; Ten people in Dallas are considered at &quot;higher risk&quot; of catching Ebola after coming into contact with Mr Duncan, but none of them have shown symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CDC has been scrambling to check more than 100 possible reported cases across the US since July, all of which have been false alarms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Rick Sacra, an American doctor who was successfully treated at the Nebraska Medical Centre last month after contracting Ebola in Liberia, was readmitted to hospital with a cough and conjunctivitis. Health officials said they did not suspect it was a recurrence of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scientists studying how Ebola spreads calculated there is a 50 per cent chance it could be transported from West Africa to Britain by Oct 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking an expected reduction in passenger air travel to infected areas into account, that figure drops to 15 per cent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 25</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1055 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of this week's annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is shared prosperity. In years gone by, the Washington consensus was all about opening up markets and cutting public spending. The new Washington consensus is the need to tackle inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody is getting in on the act. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, will share a platform with Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, next weekend to discuss how to make global capitalism more inclusive. The World Economic Forum - the body that organises the Davos shindig - thinks it can go one better. It is angling to get the pope along for its annual meeting in January.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No question, 2014 has been the year when the need to tackle inequality has gone mainstream. Oxfam kicked it off with the report showing that 85 billionaires owned as much wealth as half the world's population. Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century provided some intellectual underpinning, with its thesis that a rawer, 19th-century version of capitalism was reasserting itself. It's not hard to see why both struck a chord: a tepid global economy, high unemployment, stagnant living standards and trickle up to those at the top have created an environment of sullen unease. No political speech these days is complete without a reference to the need to ensure that a rising tide lifts all boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But talk is one thing, action another. How does Lagarde's pledge to fight inequality square with the wage cuts and austerity the IMF has imposed on Greece and Portugal as part of its bailout packages? Is there not a disparity between the commitment of the World Bank president, Jim Kim, to raise the incomes of the bottom 40% of the world's population and his organisation's Doing Business report, an annual study that ranks countries by the progress they are making in cutting corporate taxes, keeping minimum wages at low levels and ensuring that paid holidays and sick pay are not excessive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one sense, the new consensus is encouraging. There is a recognition that inequality is a problem. That's a start, a necessary but not sufficient precondition for things to change. The rhetoric has to be fleshed out to make shared prosperity meaningful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's take two examples of how it could be this week in Washington. One involves the education of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. The other is the response to Ebola in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil war in Syria has been going on for four years and more than half a million children are out of school. Schools in Lebanon cannot cope and have been promised aid from international donors. The risk of driving young people into the arms of extremist groups should be glaringly obvious. Yet, despite all the expressions of concern and the talk of solidarity, less than half the money to ensure that all Syrian refugee children can be educated has arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health systems in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - the three countries worst affected by Ebola - simply cannot cope. It's not hard to see why. In the UK, there are 2.7 doctors per 1,000 people. In Guinea, there are 0.1. In Sierra Leone and Liberia, there are so few doctors that the World Bank table registers both countries as 0.0. According to Justin Forsyth, director of Save the Children, Liberia had 61 doctors and 1,000 nurses before the crisis began. In Sierra Leone, where there were 765 new cases of Ebola last week, there are only 327 hospital beds for the whole country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Marcus Manuel of the Overseas Development Institute noted last week, tackling Ebola effectively requires a plan and enough money to make that plan work. Currently, there is neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, there is evidence of people losing confidence in the healthcare they are likely to receive, leading to them failing to come forward for treatment not just for Ebola but for other preventable, yet life-threatening, diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its early stages, Ebola was seen as a localised problem, another one of the diseases that affect poor countries in Africa. Only belatedly have the risks of a global pandemic been recognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How has this been allowed to happen? It is almost a decade since the Gleneagles G8 summit agreed to double aid flows to Africa and western governments preened themselves when the target was eventually met. Britain's coalition government now spends 0.7% of national income on aid, fulfilling the pledge made by the last Labour administration. The public has a right to know why the increase in development assistance has not left health systems in west Africa better prepared for Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of factors are involved. In part, it was because some of the additional money was never delivered: some western countries were creative when it came to dressing up debt relief or places for African students at their elite universities as aid. In part, it was because the extra money was not always well spent. The UK's Independent Commission for Aid Impact was, for example, critical of the Department for International Development, saying its work was not &quot;coherent, realistic and joined up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, the problem lies with African governments, which have made commitments to spend a higher proportion of their budgets on health and education, but have failed to do so. Most importantly, perhaps, there has been a lack of leadership. Barack Obama has not provided it. The Europeans have been too obsessed with their own financial crisis. The Chinese remain detached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test is not what policymakers say about inequality; it is what they do. It is about being prepared to redistribute resources from rich to poor. It is about creating an international tax system that prevents revenues being salted away in tax havens. It is about ensuring that trade agreements are not written by multinational corporations. It is about strengthening welfare safety nets and the rights of workers. And it is about recognising that both the private and the public sectors have a role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bear all this is mind when Washington resounds this week to calls for inequality to be tackled. There is a mountain to climb. Policy makers are still at base camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captions:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslims worldwide have climaxed the celebrations of their Islamic ritual known as EID al-Adha which comes once a year after the Hajj where Muslims all over the world slaughter animals as a sacrifice to Allah according to a mandate as per the Holy Koran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eid al-Adha which is also known as the &quot;Feast of the Sacrifice&quot; is the second of two major Eid Muslims' holidays which begins on the evening of 3rd October each year based on the lunar Islamic calendar and end up to the 13th of the same lunar month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Muslims worldwide are always set to celebrate this festival, which commemorates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of submission to God (Allah), and signifies the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia and that was also why Liberian Muslims in the country joined the congregating at the various Mosques around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muslims who have the means sacrifice cows, lambs, goats, rams or other animals on Eid al- Adha to commemorate the sacrifice of Abraham, to give the meat to the poor and according their Islamic tradition, the third of the meat is eaten by immediate family and friends, one third is given to friends and one third is donated to the needy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering the meditation at the Gurley Street Mosque, Sheikh Abukar Sumawolo, the Grand Mufti of the Republic of Liberia, cautioned all Muslims to be obedient to Allah as well as the constituted authorities by obeying all the instructions and to also be submissive to government's pronouncements regarding the running of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged all Muslims to take the preventative measures announced by health authorities seriously in the fight against the Ebola outbreak because it is intended to save lives and reiterated health warnings to stop the shaking of hands, hugging and touching dead bodies during this health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Muslim Cleric, he advised them to sacrifice animals that are physically fit without deformity because Allah deserves the best and pointed out that Abraham was an obedient servant to Allah for which the day needs to be celebrated by all Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the Imam of the Clara Town Fanima number one Mosque, Imam Mansaray, who is head of the twelve-member missionary under African Continent Committee of Kuwait engaged in the propagation of Islam indicated that &quot;Abraham's Day&quot;(Eid al-Adha) is being celebrated Worldwide by Muslims following the tradition of the Prophet Abraham and subsequently Prophet Muhammad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imam Abdullah Mansaray used the ceremony to congratulate the President, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and her government for the vigorous campaign in the fight against the Ebola virus in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing an attentive cross section of Muslims in a sermon after the Eid al- Adha prayer at that Mosque, Imam Mansaray dismissed claims by some Liberians calling for the resignation of President Sirleaf in the midst of this mysterious disaster that has engulfed the country and the sub region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Islamic community will not support such act terming it as unfortunate, unpatriotic and unprecedented at this time to poise for such stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Liberians to desist from these untimely political irregularities and concentrate on how this deadly crisis can be eliminated and further admonished Liberians to be patriotic and not to engage into any situation that will hinder the progress of the nation but to rather join the government to fight this regional crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheikh Mansaray also stressed that Ebola is not for any specific individual or selected people but that one can only survive if acknowledgeable of its reality and adhere to the necessary precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government has done and is making frantic efforts to kick this virus out of the country and stressed that the citizens should give the government chance to do its work peacefully as no one was planning for any calamity to befall this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Imam of the Clara Town Fanima number one Mosque is therefore calling on Muslims to pray sincerely to Allah and cooperate with the government in the fight against the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imam Abdulla Mansaray has also lauded the International partners and the US President, Barrack Obama for acknowledging and soliciting support around world leaders at the extraordinary session of United Nations General Assembly on the gravity of the Ebola situation in the West African sub region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He termed it as a 'plus' especially for Liberia against political discrepancies amongst some unscrupulous individuals that the United States has come to take over the government and added that it's about time that Liberians refine their mentality and provide developmental ideas to have this vicious cankerworm virus vanquished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States (US) troops have already begun its mandate of constructing Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) across the country with the support from the Armed Forces of Liberia who has rolled out its military support in the fight against the Ebola virus as of September 30, 2014.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnessing the preparation of the first in a series of nine ETUs to be constructed, the AFL Chief of Staff, Daniel Ziankahn said it is a joint operation with the U.S Military and the AFL and it commences the construction of many ETUs that will be constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General Ziankahn said the project will take between five to 12 weeks and will take from 80 to 100 beds noting that a group of AFL engineers were already in Grand Bassa County to carry out survey. He said the land capacity depends on how much the county authority would provide for the 30 units intended for each of the areas identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFL which has now rolled into civil military action according to its Chief of Staff the army is doing everything to support the health sector and that means the military can transition from time to time but the force remains committed to serving its people and nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier General Peter Corey of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) also added that their support is tied to the USAID which is the lead federal agency responsible for the U.S. response to fighting Ebola and assisting the Liberian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they are providing financial assistance and contracting, technical assistance and logistical assistance in partnership with the AFL and in support of the civilian leadership. General Corey said the DOD will not provide treatment instead will leave that to other agencies and the USAID as well as the Liberian government to determine who manages and provide healthcare for the facilities upon its completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Corey said most of the contracts are local for the fact that the building materials are purchased locally and transportation is also local. Meanwhile, the AFL has provided 20 engineers initially but the actual number might be added because the AFL has offered its human capacity for the construction of three sites simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ETUs expected to be constructed will be a total of nine in seven counties and it is observed that the ETUs are targeted for counties except Montserrado that is the epicenter of the outbreak of the virus. The counties include Bong, Margibi, Lofa, Grand Bassa, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount and Nimba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In five to 12 days, the ETUs that are expected to be completed and ready for presentation to the Liberian government will be located at the Tubmanburg Hospital, Bomi, Sinje, Cape Mount and the old BRE Compound in Own Your Own, Grand Bassa Counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those ETUs are being targets for the construction at once and the AFL engineers subcontracted have begun the survey and the bill of quality designed for each ETU are to be constructed by the U.S. Force while the Seabees will be responsible for the electrical and technical aspects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fight against the deadly Ebola virus continues across the country, more individuals have joined in the frontline to engage all sectors by spreading the preventive and rightful message in order to curb the spread of the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key amongst those individuals is Ahmed Jallanzo, a Liberian photo journalist who began street photographing 16 years ago before becoming a photo journalist in 2003 during the Liberian civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, October 2, Journalist Jallanzo presented several sanitizing and food items to the National Photographer Union of Liberia (NAPUL) with a caution that photographers are part of the fight against the deadly epidemic and should keep it safe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reminded the photographers about the effect of the deadly Ebola virus and encouraged members of NAPUL to adhere to the preventive messages seriously so as to join in the effort to kick the virus out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the items, NAPUL President, Atiliean W. Gibson, said the gesture is welcoming especially from somebody who stood on the streets of Monrovia as cameraman for years. Mr. Gibson said that the donation is a surprise and worth commendation. The NAPUL boss further said, &quot;We believe that other big photographers in and out of Liberia will see this gesture as a wakeup call for them to look back and assist their down-trodden colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The items were intended for seven downtrodden photographers who have been in the profession for years. One of the beneficiaries described the gesture as amazing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE-CARE Foundation, a local educational non- for- profit organization on Thursday, September 17, 2014 launched its Ebola response program named &quot;WAITING OUT THE EBOLA CRISIS.&quot; During the launching ceremony in the Township of West Point, the Foundation distributed over 100 parcels of assorted educational materials including flyers on the prevention of Ebola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to team of reporters, WE-CARE's Executive Director, T. Michael Weah, said the program is aimed at distributing over 10, 000 packages containing Ebola prevention fliers, bumper stickers, books, copy books and pencils. This is in direct response to schools remaining closed and the need for the children to keep learning as we all wait for the containment of the deadly Ebola disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Weah noted that the distribution is targeting 10,000 households in economically challenged communities in urban and rural Liberia. He stressed that it will be addressing the immediate need for awareness and information that are desperately needed to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The packages will provide information how to keep safe from Ebola, and will help keep our children off the streets from crowds and help them read and learn, as they await the end of the Ebola crisis and the opening of school,&quot; Mr. Weah said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE-CARE Foundation presently works in the areas of training teachers, writers, illustrators, librarians, establishing libraries, and publishing culturally relevant children books through its Reading Liberia Program. The Foundation operates the WE-CARE Library, on Carey &amp; Gurley Streets, with all services free including the Internet. Today, as a result of the Ebola crisis, the library is closed to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the United Nations, European Union, African Union, the West African Group ECOWAS, including the Mano River Basin, and other friendly countries doing all they can, the Liberian Government is exerting all means and efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite major efforts to contain the rapid spread of the Ebola virus in Liberia, which was first reported in Foya, Lofa County during March of this year, after spilling over from neighboring Guinea, that quest by Government and its international health partners have yet to yield significant results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai, speaking at the Public Works Ministry in Monrovia, launched another component of the Government's fight against the Ebola outbreak: &quot;WASH Ebola Away Strategy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This strategy is coordinated directly by the National WASH Promotion Committee, member of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector of Liberia and key partner to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Ebola Response. The public awareness and messaging component of the &quot;WASH Ebola Away Strategy&quot; is being sponsored by Global communities (formerly CHF International).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the announcement of the strategy, its operations were launched in three communities in the greater Monrovia area, including Virginia, the largest slum of West Point and Fiamah, in Montserrado County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the ceremonies in these communities, speakers explained the overall objectives of the strategy to community residents as well as the expected achievements during the first, three-month phase of implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coordinator of the National Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Committee, Abdul Koroma talked about four thematic areas: 1) House-to-House Hygiene Promotion Messaging, 2) Distribution of Hygiene Promotion Kits, 3) Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) Survey, and 4) Volunteer Temperature Testing..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Koroma, speaking at the Ministry of Public Works, disclosed that the kits will contain a standard measuring cup for chlorine, a proper hand washing guide, gloves and instructions for the proper use of all items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the KAP survey, residents in the targeted communities will be trained to ask questions on the practices carried out in the various homes on hygiene and what they know about the virus and its prevention among others&quot;, Mr. Koroma, stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Yarngo, Assistant Public Works Minister for Community Services, , who officially launched the Strategy in Virginia, West Point and Fiamah, pointed out that government can only be successful in the fight against the Ebola virus through a community - based approach. Assistant Minister Yarngo stated this as a primary reason why the &quot;WASH Ebola Away Strategy&quot; will always involve community residents in its overall operations, &quot;because it is the community residents that will best explain to others on how they all can better prevent and control the spread of the virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Minister Yarngo also highlighted that transparency and accountability will be the goal of &quot;WASH Ebola Away Strategy&quot; and expressed disapproval of those individuals engaged in the sale of anti-Ebola materials that are intended to save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The act of selling anti-Ebola materials is the greatest human rights crime against humanity, especially those items intended for the outbreak and called for stringent punishment to be taken against people that will be caught&quot;, he stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Yarngo, on behalf of the WASH Ebola Away Strategy, also extended the group's sincere thanks and appreciation to Living Water International (LWI) for providing much needed sanitary materials to help the Liberian Government in its fight against the virus. LWI provided each community with 50 rubber buckets and sanitary materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, residents of the various communities, including a prominent politician Dr. Togbah Nah Tipoteh and another Liberian, William Dennis, lauded members the National WASH Promotion Committee and LWI for the initiative, which they described as &quot;timely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WASH Ebola Away Strategy was recently launched by Vice President Joseph Boakai and focuses on four thematic areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project is expected to be strongly supported and carried out in Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties by Global Communities, an American based NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global Communities is presently carrying out Ebola education and response activity planning against the deadly outbreak under the USAID/OFDA-funded ALERT Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its support to the Liberian Government, Global Communities has also established burial teams in counties throughout Liberia in partnership with County Health Teams.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has committed itself to joining both local and international efforts aimed at flushing out the deadly Ebola virus that has killed more than nearly two thousand persons in Liberia alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Humanitarian Response Director of the Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Jennifer Poidatz concluded a weeklong visit and assured local partners of CRS that despite the fact there exist many global emergencies in Iraq, Syria, The Central African Republic and other troubled spots of the world, Liberia is &quot;really a critical emergency for CRS and we will do all we can to support it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Poidatz made these remarks after inspecting a local CRS project on Ebola prevention through community outreach, implemented by the Liberia Immunization Platform (LIP), which is a pro-child survival and immunization policy advocacy consortium in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CRS Humanitarian Chief voiced out her impression for the community sensitization CRS' partner was involved with in five huge communities of Montserrado County. While in Liberia, Ms. Poidatz toured three communities that benefited from the CRS funded Ebola awareness project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She followed up on Rehab Community, Duport and Old Road. The project extended to Lakpazee and Congo Town but other pressing engagements restricted her to visit only three (3) communities. She promised possible extension of such partnership and other program focus areas helpful to curbing the swelling Ebola cases and deaths in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic Relief Services since 1990 has been a strong partner to peace, health and developmental initiatives in Liberia. CRS is a remarkable player in humanitarian crisis. There are reports that CRS is strongly supporting the reopening of the St. Joseph Catholic Hospital that lost more than five health workers to the deadly Ebola Virus Disease. The oldest hospital in Liberia, St. Joseph Catholic Hospital shut down in early August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Liberia Immunization Platform, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of LIP, George Stewart appreciated CRS for another round of support, this time in the Ebola crisis. He said his civil society group had the opportunity to participate in the fight against Ebola through the CRS funding of Seventy Eighty Thousand, Four Hundred Ninety Six Dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has expressed LIP's readiness to engage in more anti-Ebola activities once CRS and other partners keep supporting the local initiative. The Liberia Immunization Platform runs a yearlong grant project from the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) and managed by the Catholic Relief Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report says, during Jennifer's stay in Monrovia, she held talks with many stakeholders, including authorities of the Catholic Church in Liberia and Ministry of Health and Social Welfare officials. She said to have met with WHO authorities in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of the Ebola virus is certainly having multiple negative impacts on the lives of the Liberian people, their way of life, their love for one another in their families and communities, their economy and their politics. The Ebola virus may cause the indefinite postponement of the 2014 mid-term senatorial election and this situation bears the potential for confusion and conflict if the issue of postponement is not exhaustively thought through and discussed publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is about the negative impact of the Ebola virus on an important upcoming political process, the 2014 mid-term Senatorial Election. It is intended for a lively, but informed debate for the purpose of sustaining the peace by an orderly discourse, in order to avoid unnecessary confusion and conflict based on ignorance or lack of information or hasty conclusion. In this respect, this article is a contribution to the peace-building and conflict prevention process. It would be a useful exercise for those who have views counter to those expressed in this article, preferably lawyers, to come forward with re-joinders in order to provide an opportunity for the Liberian people to have a clearer understanding of the issue under discussion as an avenue for the people to develop a national consensus in dealing with this important national issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two prevailing views about the up-coming mid-term senatorial election. One view is that the election should be held on October 14, this year and the new Senators installed into office on the Second Monday in January 2015, consistent with the Constitution of Liberia. The proponents of this view maintain that if this does not happen, then Liberia will experience a constitutional crisis, as the Liberian Senate will not be fully constituted to carry out its constitutional duties. The other view is that the senatorial election should be postponed indefinitely, until the spread of the Ebola virus is brought under control, or stopped or until the government of Liberia develops the capacity to stop the spread of the virus and Liberia is declared an Ebola free country, like Nigeria and Senegal. Those who hold this view argue that the holding of elections in Liberia this year is not possible because all of the activities associated with the process of holding election run counter to the advice of the experts, against the spread of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contention of those who are seeking a postponement of the senatorial election is that the advice carried in the media in Liberia is that individuals should not touch any person who has symptoms of Ebola, or should not come in contact with the body fluid of such person. Saliva and sweat are two body fluids that people come in contact with easily when they find themselves in crowded places, such as training sessions, campaign rallies, debate sessions, polling stations, assembly for the announcement of election results and celebrations or protest demonstrations after elections. Therefore, the proponents of the postponement of the up-coming senatorial election hold the view that to conduct election while the death rate due to the spread of Ebola is increasing all over the country, with the experts predicting more deaths at an exponential rate, in the coming months, if not much is done, will be a serious threat to the lives of the Liberian people, thereby making the election an unnecessary risk. This author supports the view that election should be postponed because Liberia is undeniably the country most negatively affected by the spread of Ebola in the Mano River Sub-region. The United Nations has declared this outbreak of the Ebola virus, a threat to international security. Estimates by world renown virologist have put the estimates of possible infections by the Ebola virus variously at , twenty thousand persons, four hundred thousand persons and one million four hundred thousand persons in the affected countries. Deaths from Ebola in nearly two thousand or more, the highest among the Ebola affected countries and the highest in world history. This is a very serious development that makes the issue of the holding of mid-term senatorial election a luxury. This article will delve into the legal implication of postponing the holding of the up-coming mid-term senatorial election in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the postponement of the up-coming senatorial election present a potential for a constitutional crisis in Liberia? The answer to this question is a big NO! Before explaining this answer, it is important to give some clarifications on the composition and terms of office of members of the Liberian Senate. The Constitution of Liberia provides, &quot;... Each County shall elect two Senators and each Senator shall have one vote in the Senate... &quot; (Article 45 of the Constitution of Liberia). The Constitution then went further to categorize the senators; and it did so in the following manner: &quot;... the Senators shall be divided into two categories as the result of the votes cast in each County. The Senator with the higher votes cast shall be Senator of the first category; and the senator with the lower votes cast shall be senator of the second category; provided that no two Senators of the same County shall be placed in the same category. The seats of the Senators of the first category shall be vacated at the expiration of the ninth year. In the interest of legislative continuity, the Senators of the second category shall serve a first term of six years only after the first elections. Thereafter, all Senators shall be elected to serve a term of nine years.&quot;(Article 46 of the Constitution of Liberia) This means that in 2005, the senatorial candidates of each county who obtained the highest number of votes became a Senator of the first category and the Senatorial candidates with the next higher number of votes became Senator of the second category. Generally, Liberians refer to the Senators of the first category as Senior Senators and those of the second category Junior Senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this background, it is important to note that in the 2011 General and Presidential Elections, only the Junior Senators participated as candidates, because their term of office was for six years, which expired on the Second Monday in January 2012. The Senators who were elected in 2011 and seated on the Second Monday in January, 2012 shall remain in office for nine years ending on the Second Monday in January, 2022. Their successors shall be elected in October, 2021 and be seated on the Second Monday in January 2022. The up-coming senatorial election is for those who were categorized as Senators of the first category or Senior Senators on the Second Monday in January 2006. The next group of Senators to be elected in the up-coming elections shall serve for nine years ending on the Second Monday in January, 2025. Their successors shall be elected in 2024 and seated on the second Monday in January 2025. This means that in 2017, there will be no senatorial election. The election in 2017 shall be for the President and members of the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the unique functions of the Senate and how does it make decisions? The Liberian Senate has four basic functions that it performs exclusive of the House of Representatives. The first one is to give consent to the nominees of the President for appointment into public offices.(article 54 of the Constitution of Liberia) The second function of the Senate is to serve as a court for impeachment proceedings (Article 43 of the Constitution of Liberia). The third is the election and removal of the President Pro Tempore and officers of the Senate. In order to impeach any person, two thirds of the membership of the Senate must concur. (ibid). The percentage of votes required by the Senate to give consent to the appointment of a presidential nominee is not stated in the constitution. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that it is simple majority of the members present. The Constitution does not state the percentage of votes required for the election of the President Pro Tempore and officers of the Senate. But it provides that the removal of the President Pro Tempore and officers of the Senate shall be by two thirds majority of the members of the Senate. (See article 47 of the Constitution of Liberia). It could, therefore, be assumed that the votes required for the election of the President Pro Tempore is simple majority. The assumption that it could mean simple majority if supported by Senate Rule 14 which provides, &quot;... The President Pro Tempore shall be elected by a simple majority of the duly seated Senators...&quot; The fourth function that the Senate performs by itself is the adoption of its own rules and the expulsion of a member for cause. The votes required for this is two thirds of the membership of the Senate. (Article 38 of the Constitution of Liberia). All other functions of the Senate are performed with the concurrence of the House of Representatives, either by simple majority or by two thirds majority depending on the issue. Article 33 of the Constitution provides, &quot;A simple majority of each House shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but a lower number may adjourn from day to day and compel attendance of absent members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is simple majority? According the Black's Law Dictionary, a simple majority is &quot;a numerical majority of those actually voting&quot;. Absent members, members who are present, but do not vote, blanks, and abstentions are disregarded. (Black's Law Dictionary 9th ed.) This means what the Constitution of Liberia is saying is that the number of Senators required for the transaction of business is the majority of the Senators &quot;actually voting&quot;. This majority could be of thirty Senators or of fifteen Senators or any number between the two numbers. If a simple majority of each House means a simple majority of all the members, then according to the Black's law Dictionary, it means, &quot;a majority of all the actual members, disregarding vacancies; also termed constitutional majority; majority of the entire membership; majority of the membership.&quot; In this case, it means a majority of the entire members of the Senate. According to the Constitution of Liberia this means thirty Senators. But is this what the Constitution of Liberia means when it says, &quot;A simple majority of each House shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business... ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before proceeding any further it is important to look at other concepts of majority that should be looked at in an attempt to understand the number of Senators the Constitution of Liberia require for the transaction of business. The first is the concept of absolute majority. Absolute majority is &quot;a majority of all those who are entitled to vote in a particular election, regardless of how many voters actually cast ballots.) Black's Law Dictionary, 9th ed.) This would be a vote of a majority out of thirty Senators. This certainly is not simple majority. The second concept of majority that should be considered is the concept of super majority. Super majority is &quot;a fixed proportion greater than half (often two-thirds or a percentage greater than fifty percent)&quot;. (Black's Law Dictionary 9th ed.) This is certainly not what the Constitution requires for the transaction of business by the Senate. A majority in parliamentary law could mean all members or some subset, such as all members present or all members voting on a particular question.&quot;( Black's Law Dictionary 9th ed.) However, the Constitution of Liberia simply states, &quot;A simple majority of each House shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business&quot;. It does not say a simple majority of members present or members voting, etc. For the purpose of this discourse, since it is for public consumption, it is important to define the term quorum in legislative term. According to Black's Law Dictionary, quorum is the minimum number of members (usually a majority of all the members) who must be present for a deliberative assembly to legally transact business. (Black's Law Dictionary, 9th ed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to understand what the Constitution of Liberian means for the Liberian Senate when it says, &quot;A simple majority of each House shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business&quot;, it is important to look at the procedural rules that govern the Senate in its operation as a legislative body. Rule Seven of the Liberian Senate is the relevant rule for the topic under discussion. Rule Seven of the Senate Rules provides, &quot;A simple majority of the Senators who have been duly seated shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business and a two third (2/3) of said quorum shall be binding... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The qualifying words here that distinguishes Senate Rule 7 from Article 33 of the Constitution are, &quot;Senators who have been duly seated... &quot; (see THE LIBERIAN LEGISLATURE: STANDING RULES OF THE LIBERIAN SENATE, 2009). The word seated means &quot;to place somebody or yourself in a chair or other seat&quot; (Encarta Webster's Dictionary of English Language). This could mean those Senators who are present and seated at the call of any meeting of the Senate, if one relies on the meaning of seated as &quot;to place yourself in a chair or other seat&quot;. It could also mean the official taking of seats by Senators at the commencement of their work as Senators. The Black's Law Dictionary defines the word duly to mean, &quot;In a proper manner; in accordance with legal requirements.&quot; In the former case a simple majority of the number of Senators present could constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the latter case, the quorum for the transaction of business is the simple majority of the members who were seated on the first day of official business or the entire membership of the Liberian Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Rule 7 of the Senate rules says that a simple majority of those seated could form a quorum for the transaction of business, suggests that there could be a situation whereby Senators are not present and sitting in their seats at the call of a meeting and in that case Senate deliberations are limited to those present and sitting in their seats, or there could be a situation whereby some Senators are elected but not yet sworn into office ( as the case may be following a mid-term election) thereby restricting deliberations of the Senate only to those Senators who have been sworn into office; or there could be a situation whereby some Senators are unseated with some remaining seated, thereby limiting deliberations of the Senate to those who remain seated. In other words seated members of the Senate could be the full membership in accordance with the Constitution including those of both category A and those of category B or a lesser number of each category. The words seated members could also be restricted to only members of one category of the Senate, if the other category is not seated. What should be underscored is that Rule 7 provides for a fraction of the Senate to transact the business of the Senate and that fraction is the duly seated members. The other fraction is the none seated members. This fraction is not qualified to participate in the transaction of business of the Senate. In other words, the framers of the rule contemplated a situation whereby there could be seated members and non-seated members. Without this logical conclusion, the word seated would be meaningless. If this was not what the framers of Rule 7 meant, then the rule could have just said members of the Senate, without the use of the word seated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is whether a simple majority of fifteen members of the Senate can transact business, where there are only fifteen duly seated members of the Senate? The answer to this question is in the affirmative. The Constitution contains a clause that provides for continuity of the work of the Senate, where fifteen members of the Senate are not seated or are out of office due to the expiration of their term. It conceived of the possibility of a delay in the holding of an election which could then cause a delay in the seating of new members of the Senate, by providing the qualifying words &quot;legislative continuity&quot; in article 46 of the Constitution. Article 46 of the Constitution of Liberia provides, &quot;... In the interest of legislative continuity, the Senators of the second category shall serve a first term of six years only after the first elections... &quot; In other words &quot;legislative continuity&quot; is the purpose for the Constitution creating two categories of the Liberian Senate and staggering their terms of office. Also, it can be concluded that this provision was meant to prevent a break in the work of the Senate caused by a senatorial election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the same clause is not contained anywhere in the Constitution of Liberia when it comes to the House of Representatives, there can be no other logical way of thinking about this clause of the Constitution, other than to conclude that it was meant to allow for fifteen Senators to always be present for performing the functions of the Senate. Therefore, there can be no crisis, if senatorial elections are delayed, unless such delay continues for six consecutive years. It is only a delay to have senatorial elections for six years from now on that could lead to the senate being totally vacant, thereby presenting a constitutional crisis as there would be no member of the Senate, because the term of every current member of the Senate would have expired. Since the House of Representatives alone cannot perform the functions of the Legislature, then, the absence of all members of the Senate in the Legislature due to a delay in the holding of senatorial election for a period of six years would definitely lead to a constitutional crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it should be clear to everyone reading this article that both the Constitution of Liberia by placing emphasis on &quot;legislative continuity&quot; and Rule 7 of the Standing Rules of the Liberian Senate, by placing emphasis on seated members of the Senate, provided room for a fraction of the Liberian Senate to transact the business of the Senate. Hoping that the argument that fifteen members of the Senate can transact the business of the Liberian Senate in now clear and understood by the readers of this article, the remaining issue is that requires discussion is what would be the status of the fifteen members of the Liberian Senate who should be standing for the mid-term election, if the said election is delayed beyond the Second Monday in January, 2015, the time for the legislature to assemble for the commencement of their duties for the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens to the fifteen members of the Senate, whose seats are up for election this year, if elections are delayed until their current term of office expires on the Second Monday of January, 2015? There is no precedent for such a situation in the legislative history of Liberia. Therefore, it is important to look to the Constitution of Liberia for an answer. The Constitution contains no provision for what should be done in the case of a delay or the impossibility of holding election on time. It only provides what should be done in the case of a vacancy for an elected position, if such position becomes vacant as a result of resignation, removal, or impeachment. In the case of the President, a vacancy is addressed by relying on the succession clause of the Constitution of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of a member of the legislature, a vacancy is addressed by the holding of by-election in ninety days. But there is no provision for what happens if a legislative election is delayed and the term of a legislator expires. Can the legislature pass a joint resolution to postpone the time for the holding of an election? The answer is No. There is no provision of the Constitution that gives the legislature this authority. Can the President postpone the holding of an election? The answer is a qualified Yes, taken into consideration the extraordinary power of the President during a state of emergency. The reason is that while the Constitution does not clearly provide for the President of Liberia to postpone an election, during the existence of a state of emergency, properly proclaimed, the President has the authority during such period to suspend certain constitutional rights. She has the right to suspend the right of free movement, the right of free assembly and other rights in her effort to address the problem for which a state of emergency exists. The Election Commission can then schedule election when a state emergency is lifted. So, while the Constitution does not provide for a postponement of election by the President, it provides for suspension of rights, safe for the right to the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can the term of office of the fifteen Senators whose term of office expires in January 2015 be extended? The answer is NO. The reason is that the Constitution does not provide for the extension of a term of office of an elected official by any means other than succeeding himself by wining of another legislative election. Neither the President nor the Legislature has that authority under the Constitution of Liberia to extend a term of a member or members of any division of the legislature. The President of Liberia may &quot;extend a regular session of the legislature beyond the date of adjournment or call a special or extraordinary session of that body to discuss or act upon matters of national emergency and concern.&quot;(see article 32 of the Constitution of Liberia). This extension does not cover the term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extension of a term of office can only be done by a constitutional amendment. However, the Constitution of Liberia prohibits any constitutional amendment during the existence of a state of emergency. It provides at Article 87 as follows: &quot;... no constitutional amendment shall be promulgated during a state of emergency.&quot; Therefore, the proper thing that should happen is that at the end of the term of office of the fifteen Senators whose seats are up for election, the said Senators should vacate their seats as there would be no constitutional or statutory justification for them to hold their seats indefinitely until the mid-term senatorial election is held. By the Second Monday in January, 2015, these Senators, the Senior Senators would have served their full nine year term. They must, as a matter of law, therefore, vacate their seats at that time. They have a right to run for those seats again and they may win, but they have no legal right or justification for holding those seats beyond their term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members of the public have been concerned about what should happen to the salaries and benefits of the Senators whose seats would be vacant beginning on the Second Monday in January, 2015, if elections are not held before that time. Since the government is scrambling for money to deal with the Ebola virus, it would be in the national interest to re-direct the salaries and benefits of those Senators whose seats would be vacant to combating the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the light of what have been said in this article, all Liberians should focus their attention on striving hard to stop the spread of Ebola in Liberia because this virus has the potential of drastically reducing the population of Liberia and negatively impacting everything in the country. All other issues of national importance are, in the mind of this author, secondary in the face of the very serious threat posed by Ebola. There is no legal basis for the fear that the postponement of the senatorial election will create a constitutional crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Liberians Must First Unite To Save Liberia From Ebola. All Other Issues Including The Mid-Term Senatorial Elect Must Be Considered Secondary Until Ebola Is Defeated. There Can Be No Liberia Without Liberians. Therefore, Lets First Stop Ebola From Liberians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two additional mobile testing labs from the U.S. Government, which were flown into Liberia last weekend, have already been installed and are up and running at the Ebola Treatment Units at Island Clinic and in Bong County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Navy laboratories, part of the ongoing Joint Forces Command-United Assistance, reduce the time needed to determine if a sick person has Ebola from several days to just a few hours, and are capable of processing about 80 samples a day. Members of a U.S. Navy Medical Research Unit will operate both laboratories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having a laboratory on site will dramatically improve our ability to provide appropriate care to all of our patients,&quot; Dr. Pranav Shetty, Emergency Medical Coordinator for International Medical Corps (IMC), said. &quot;The sooner we can confirm patients who are positive (for Ebola), the sooner they can receive specialized care.&quot; IMC is the organization running the Bong County site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the sooner we can identify patients as negative,&quot; Dr. Shetty said, &quot;the sooner they can be discharged from the ETU and return safely to their communities. We welcome the U.S. Navy to our unit in Bong County and thank them for their dedication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mobile testing labs are part of the U.S. effort to help the government of Liberia and other Ebola-affected countries contain the Ebola virus, save lives and alleviate human suffering. Other U.S. activities include setting up a logistics base to facilitate the flow of U.S. military personnel, supplies, and equipment into the affected region, helping to build 17 Ebola treatment units, and training hundreds of health care workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead U.S. government agency overseeing the overall U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The U.S. military response, led by Major General Darryl Williams, Commanding General of U.S. Army Africa, is acting in support of the USAID-led Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) by providing expertise in command and control, engineering and logistics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VP Boakai joyfully returns to the VIP Lounge at RIA after inspecting the 100-ton consignment of medical supplies airlifted by Samaritan Purse International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A non-denominational evangelical Christian organization, Samaritan Purse International, has brought into the country a consignment of medical supplies to buttress government's efforts in the fight against the Ebola virus disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an Executive Mansion release, the nearly 100-ton consignment was airlifted to Liberia on Thursday, October 2, 2014 from the United States of America through the Roberts International Airport (RIA) as a demonstration of its humanitarian work in Liberia since 2003. The consignment includes personal protective equipment (PPEs), anti-malaria and anti-body drugs, chlorine, and buckets, among other items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaying the cargo to Vice President Joseph Boakai, the team leader of the Disaster Assistance Response at Samaritan Purse International, Mr. Nathan Glancy, said the donation marks the initial entry point of the organization since they temporarily pulled out three months ago following the infection of several of its doctors with the Ebola virus disease while catering to patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Glancy indicated that their return to Liberia will encompass clinical care, support and community awareness in Montserrado, Lofa, Margibi and the south-eastern counties of Liberia. They are expected to come online next Monday, October 6, 2014. Responding, Vice President Boakai thanked the aid organization for their involvement in the Ebola fight and the latest intervention will further hasten the virus eradication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that the airlifting of the huge consignment is a demonstration of government-partner collaboration in mobilizing all the support needed in ensuring that the country is free from the Ebola virus disease once again. The Liberian Vice President recounted the involvement of the Samaritan Purse International in Liberia's health care delivery system since its operation began in 2003 and expressed no doubt that their return would help change the situation as they work with other partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reassured the international humanitarian organization of government's fullest support for its work in the country and promised to provide the platform for its smooth operation and services to humanity. On behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Dr. Boakai expressed government's gratitude to Samaritan Purse International and how Liberia values the partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He informed the gathering that he had earlier on spoken with the aid organization's Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Franklin Graham, while on his way to the RIA to witness the arrival of the consignment and expressed happiness for the return of the organization. Deputy Health Minister for Administration Matthew Flomo, who represented Health and Social Welfare Minister Walter Gwenigale, described the efforts by Samaritan Purse as yet another giant step taken by one of government's partners in the Ebola eradication partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The departure of the 747 cargo plane from Charlotte, North Carolina, USA was witnessed by Liberia's Ambassador to the United States, H.E. Jeremiah Sulonteh and one of the American doctors who got infected with Ebola while on assignment in Liberia, Dr. Franklin Graham. He has since been cured of the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samaritan Purse International is a non-denominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world since 1970. The organization has helped victims of war, poverty, natural disasters, disease, and famine with the purpose of sharing God's love through His Son, Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market women in the Lakpazee Community in the Airfield Sinkor area of Monrovia were in jubilation last Friday when the Ex-Board Chairman of the National Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL), Robert Sirleaf (RAS), promised that he would help them access micro-Finance loans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former NOCAL Board Chairman and an aspirant for the Montserrado County Senatorial seat reminded residents of the community that when he promises, he delivers on his promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Sirleaf, during the last election, he promised market women in the community that he would construct the Lakpazee market. &quot; Today, marketers are in that market,&quot; he said, adding that right now everyone's focus is on eradicating the Ebola virus. He said he would request the Ebola Task Force to help prevent the virus in the community and the country as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sirleaf reiterated his determination to help women and the youths in the various communities around Monrovia. He said there is a need for the residents to live in a way that will prevent them being affected with the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the market women, we are going to give you micro-credit loans to enable you jump-start your market as you need to find something to eat,&quot; he said, thanking all those who found time to attend the program including market women who were present in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, my team has already organized private school teachers to reach out and teach people how to read and write,&quot; Mr. Sirleaf said. Concerning youths, Mr. Sirleaf observed: &quot;They are our children. We just have to put hands around them to find something for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded on reassuring the Lakpazee market women that they would receive the micro-credit loans in addition to constructing the floor of the Lakpazee community hall and refurbishment of the market building's ceiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, a resident of the community, Madam Nana Herron appealed to Mr. Sirleaf to provide the market women with micro-credit loans. She emphasized that right business in the community was slow, children were not going to school and lots of unemployment and workers were not going to work; something she said is creating hardship for many homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the loan facility would enable them engage in productive activities. Madam Herron said since the outbreak of the Ebola virus Liberia is going through a difficult moment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1143 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is leading countless other Liberians who are foaming with rage over the &quot;exportation&quot; of the deadly Ebola to the United States. Perhaps the high temperature of the raged segment of the population against Thomas Duncan comes from the backdrop that he's the second Liberian to do so, the first being Patrick Sawyer who took the virus to Nigeria; something that they believe impugns on the image on a country already entering the Guinness Book of Records as having the highest fatalities to Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, Madam President, or perhaps her Government, thinks Duncan whose health situation is reportedly worsening has committed an &quot;unpardonable&quot; crime for which he will be prosecuted if he gets well. Legal experts are debating the veracity of any reason for Duncan's prosecution; whether he knowingly or unknowingly took Ebola to a country that is doing everything humanly possible to help Liberia overcome the menace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, former Public Works Minister Samuel Kofi Woods, has announced offering his legal defense for President Sirleaf's culprit, Thomas Eric Duncan. The Analyst reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Public Works Minister in the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf administration and Human Rights Lawyer, Attorney Samuel Kofi Woods says he will respond positively to any request for legal representation of Mr. Thomas Duncan if the Government of Liberia decides to prosecute him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Thomas Eric Duncan is the first person to develop symptoms outside Africa during the current epidemic, another Liberian, Patrick Sawyer, was the first to take the virus out of Liberia to the populous confederation of Nigeria. He later died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The faces of Liberians again scrupled when it was reported that another Liberian was diagnosed of the deadly virus in the United States. The latest development put Liberians on edge for the kind of image spreading across the global community particularly following a decade and half of civil conflict that nearly put the country in a state of isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently furious over the situation, some Liberians, including President Sirleaf, have been contending that Eric Duncan is fit for prosecution. But responding to inquiries by some Liberians during his recent visit to Atlanta where he was invited to speak at a forum organized by the Carter Center and the Emory University's schools of Ethics and International Development Studies, Atty. Woods said he would offer to provide legal defense for the ailing Duncan if requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods told the anxious crowd of Liberians and Americans that it would be premature at this stage to discuss the innocence or guilt of Mr. Duncan as to whether Duncan knowingly and deliberately planned to mislead authorities when he answered &quot;no&quot; to questions about his prior contact with Ebola patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notable Liberian human rights advocate said he would rather at this time focus on proper legal representation, and Mr. Duncan's rights to free and fair trial and the guarantees of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is also not an attempt to justify any action of Mr. Duncan,&quot; he said and added: &quot;At the appropriate time and when necessary we will review all of the factual circumstances and deal with the legal issues; not sentiments, emotions and brinkmanship, Woods declared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights lawyer also expressed the hope that the government's pronouncement of its intention to prosecute the ailing Duncan if he survives and returns to Liberia is not another move to pander to the international community and particularly the US Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods also expressed the hope that by this newfound desire and willingness by Government to prosecute is the beginning of a era to end impunity and proceed to demonstrate respect for the rule of law and address previous cases of neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also described the government's response to the Ebola epidemic as woefully inadequate and disjointed, emphasizing that in the event that the government proceeds with this case, &quot;we will assemble the best legal team to put the Liberian government on trial, for failing the people of Liberia, rather than Mr. Duncan, a victim of institutional neglect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know too well the trail of the countless display of wholesale impunity, complicity, neglect and abuses that have occurred recently and over the years under the watchful eyes of this Government,&quot; the former Public Works Minister stressed. &quot;The list is endless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have said repeatedly that we continue to commit moral sin and ethical transgression against the poor and weak,&quot; he said, indicating further that it is the poor, weak and powerless that are vulnerable to the caprices of Liberian governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated further: &quot;We ignore their needs and demands, we reward their abusers, turn a blind eye to the theft and abuse that deprive them of basic social services including health care, yet we are anxious to punish them, even before we gather all the facts. This must stop!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods noted that the current situation in Liberia is primarily a health emergency and primacy must be given to the health experts to deal with such a situation, wondering, &quot;What has been the response to assure Liberians and the world that we are serious? Have we conducted the relevant testing, contact tracing, isolated those who came in contact with Mr. Duncan and invoke health regulations?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights advocate said &quot;We must announce measures that will re assure our population and give them hope rather than rush to judgment. This is the mistake we continue to make by overzealousness and ego desires,&quot; expressing the hopes that the Liberian Government will answer these critical questions before pronouncing or proceeding with a prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Atty. Woods has maintained that Ebola is a Global tragedy and requires urgent and decisive global action. He noted that Ebola has no border, sees no race, color or religion. &quot;It is a ferocious enemy seeking to devour the human race and it can only be stopped by the collective action of everyone,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods then reiterated his appeal for a more sustainable engagement to eradicate the virus. Measure he recommended include designing and developing a contemporary comprehensive health plan and strategy; upgrading Liberia's antiquated health system; and reviewing, realigning and accounting for donors assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For former Public Works Minister also recommend increase in treatment centers, access and ensure quick testing and diagnosis and providing the population with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE's) so they can be able to care for relatives, clean and disinfect their environments and protect themselves as they await the intervention of healthcare workers, amongst others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has commended the international community for its support but urged urgency. He also praised President Obama for &quot;pledging whatever federal resources were necessary to treat Mr. Duncan and ensure that the virus will not spread&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst Jubilation, sorrow and crying, Eleven Ebola Patients who recovered at the weekend were officially discharged and turned over to their relatives. Those discharged include Promises Galakemene of Harmon Hill/ Senjeh District, Kula Coleman of Joe Town/ Dewoin District, Patience Kamara of Harmon Hill/Senjeh District, Susan K. Kamara of Joseph Town/Senjeh District, Bendu Kamara of Nyala Community/Senjeh District, Fatee Sheriff of Joseph Town/Senjeh District and Elizabeth Kundo of Joseph Town/Senjeh District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are Jowel Khovoy of Joseph Town/Senjeh District, Tenanie Golafaley of Gbao/Suehn Mecca District, Charles Robert of Sass town/ Suehn Mecca District and Jenneh Karnley who is the only Bomi EVD Survivor from ELWA-ETU. The Ebola survivors were struck by the deadly pandemic and were later admitted to the only referral Liberian Government Hospital in Tubmanburg, Bomi County, where they have reclaimed their lives and sanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eleven Ebola Patients were formally discharged after undergoing a protracted period of curable treatment from the Community-based Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Bomi County under the supervision of a Liberian Medical Doctor, Dr. G. Gorbee Logan, the health officer of Bomi and co-chair of the county's Ebola task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking over the Weekend at the Reunification and Certification Program of some eleven Ebola Virus Disease Survivors, House Speaker J. Alex Tyler expressed thanks and appreciation to the county's health team and all those who have worked harder together to make the occasion possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker Tyler said the Bomi County Legislative Caucus is proud to be a part of this program and to tell those of the Bomi ebola suspected patients to be willingness to submit to treatment earlier as they eschewed denial. The speaker further indicated that they were glad that Bomi has survivors of the deadly disease, stating that every one of them of the Bomi Legislative Caucus and the people of Bomi hope to see survivors been treated and cure from the Ebola Disease at ETUs in Bomi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, Mr. Tyler who received survivors and spoke on behalf of the Bomi County Legislative Caucus noted that the people of Bomi should be sensitized enough to protect themselves from contraction of the Ebola deadly virus once they follow the rules or protocol laid down by health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;This is a clear manifestation that, once we go by what the health people say, we all will be well, Ebola yes even though is an invisible enemy, but it will not kill all of us&quot;. Speaker Tyler told his kinsmen that once they start to detect the symptom of Ebola, they should report to the hospital at once to seek medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believed that the people of Bomi will harbor no doubt about the existence of Ebola because since they have seen for themselves that that some people were infected with it, treated and were being discharged. &quot;You have seen it for yourselves that Ebola is real and Ebola Disease is a killer,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bomi County lawmaker lauded the efforts by the county health team for the good work they have exhibited in making sure that the Ebola patients were cured and have survived, following long period in isolation and treatment from the hospital. The Chief Health Officer of Bomi County and Co-Chair of Bomi Ebola Taskforce, Dr. Gorbee Logan, said a there was no Ebola Treatment Unit in the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, he managed to brave the storm alongside with few others t to volunteer in the treatment of the Ebola patients who have been formally been discharged. Dr. Logan said those who survive the deadly virus in Bomi were able to survive because they responded to the treatment on time, stressing that this is why he was able to treat or cure them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the stuff that nightmares are made of, and day by day it is getting worse. The Ebola epidemic, says Dr Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), is now &quot;the greatest peacetime challenge&quot; since the Second World War. Yet her own organisation's tardiness, partly caused by cuts, together with reductions in - and misuse of - funds elsewhere, are largely responsible for Ebola spiralling out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially 7,178 people have caught the horrific disease in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal: 3,338 have died. The toll is greater than the combined total of 25 previous outbreaks of the haemorrhagic fever in the 38 years since its discovery near Congo's Ebola river. And that is certainly a gross underestimate - many more are sickening and dying unknown in remote villages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's just the beginning. At present the numbers of people infected are thought to be doubling in under 30 days - and the blue-chip US Center for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that, if Ebola goes on accelerating, 1.4 million West Africans could have contracted the disease by the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whole nations are close to collapse. Sierra Leone's economy is reported to have deflated by 30 per cent. Schools in affected countries are closed. Harvests rot in the fields. Hospitals are so overwhelmed that they are not merely turning away Ebola cases, but also people stricken with other deadly diseases such as malaria. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, has warned of impending economic disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one saving grace is that the infectious disease spreads with difficulty, through bodily fluids, which means it can be contained with strong enough measures even in Africa. This is why Western health systems are confident that they can prevent an epidemic at home. But this week Anthony Banbury, chief of the UN's Ebola mission, raised the possibility that the virus could mutate to spread by air, like flu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So why was this epidemic not contained long ago, like previous ones? It didn't help that it hit countries with few medics: Liberia was left with only 30 doctors when its civil war ended in 2003, compared with 2,000 beforehand. It is also down to the poorly resourced countries to report outbreaks; this one was not identified until March, three months after the first victim is thought to have caught Ebola from a fruit bat. But previous, controlled episodes of the plague also occurred in poor African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time, however, the world was slow to react. Kent Brantly - the American doctor who survived the virus - says that pleas for international help &quot;appeared to fall on deaf ears&quot;. The charity M&eacute;decins sans Frontier&Egrave;s (MSF) - on the ground from early on in the outbreak - recalls &quot;screaming&quot; at the WHO &quot;to gear up and scale up&quot;, without success. The organisation finally declared an emergency in August; senior officials admit it was far too slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That may have reflected budget cuts. When the financial crisis struck, WHO - funded by world governments - had to cut nearly $1 billion from its planned two-year budget. Staff charged with responding to disease outbreaks were slashed by 35 per cent; funds for it by half. Emergency experts used to fighting Ebola in Africa were reduced from more than a dozen to three. Only one remained at headquarters to oversee all haemorrhagic diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, the Commons International Development Committee condemned the Government for cutting aid to Liberia and Sierra Leone, saying this may have helped compromise their health systems. Channelling money through the EU was even worse, it found. Brussels had given $60 million for health in Liberia over the past two years, but the country's treasury had hung onto almost all of it, spending only $3.9 million on its real purpose. Britain seemed little concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, the crisis has revealed huge deficiencies in how the world responds to epidemics. On Thursday governments met in London to work out how to improve their response radically; Britain has already promised an extra &pound;125 million. But M&eacute;decins sans Frontier&Egrave;s say that while &quot;everyone in their intentions is moving fast&quot;, progress in the field is &quot;at the speed of a tortoise&quot;. It is increasingly agreed that the window for effective action is closing fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if we do enough, fast enough, to contain the outbreak, this is most unlikely to be the last plague to threaten the world, and the next may be more infectious and spread more widely and rapidly. It is time to accept that global threats can only be tackled globally and that - as someone said - we are all in it together.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH-AMERICAN television cameraman has contracted Ebola in Liberia and is being evacuated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ashoka Mukpo, 33, who has dual nationality, was diagnosed with the virus while working as a freelance for the US network NBC News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His British mother Diana Mukpo, who was at school with the Princess Royal and now runs a dressage centre in the US, has been speaking to her son several times a day by phone and said he would be flown to the US tomorrow. His fianc&eacute;e is flying from London to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diana Mukpo, 61, told The Daily Telegraph: &quot;Ashoka is doing quite well. He has a fever and sore throat, the early symptoms. He hasn't progressed to the other symptoms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Obviously, he is scared. He is very frightened but he is very relieved he's being evacuated. His mood is much better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mukpo graduated from Columbia University in New York, and the London School of Economics, in international conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had done human rights work in Liberia for two years and returned recently as a cameraman and writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His mother said: &quot;We were extremely worried but he felt a real connection to the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In spite of what's happened as a family, we are extremely proud of Ashoka and his care for humanity. He did know the risks but he did this because he cares for the people of Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said her son did not know how he contracted the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He took all the necessary precautions and he was very aware of the precautions to take,&quot; she said. &quot;He helped decontaminate a car and he was wearing protective [gear] but he thinks maybe some water splashed on him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mukpo is currently being treated at a M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res centre in Monrovia. &quot;We are speaking to him several times a day and he is getting the best care they can give,&quot; his mother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She praised the US state department for their &quot;compassion&quot; in flying her son back to the US, adding: &quot;I cannot say how much I appreciate how wonderful the government has been.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mukpo is the second Briton to be infected during the Ebola outbreak which has killed more than 3,300 people in west Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Pooley, a volunteer nurse, contracted the virus in Sierra Leone and was flown back to Britain. He was treated in a special unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London and was discharged last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mukpo's mother is a former pupil of Benenden School, the boarding school for girls in Kent, where she was three years behind the Princess Royal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy barrister. At the age of 16 she married Ch&ouml;gyam Trungpa, who was 28 and went on to become a high-profile guru and controversial figure in Tibetan Buddhism in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The marriage, which took place in Scotland, was front page news in some British newspapers and she later became known as Lady Diana Judith Mukpo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ashoka's father is Dr Mitchell Levy, the medical director of the intensive care unit at Rhode Island Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cameraman had been hired on Tuesday to work with the NBC News chief medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman. In a statement NBC said: &quot;As part of a routine temperature check he discovered he was running a slight fever. He immediately quarantined himself and sought medical advice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He went to the M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&Egrave;res treatment centre and a positive result for Ebola came back 12 hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Snydeman told NBC that she, Mukpo and the rest of their crew were checked at a border crossing and showed no elevated temperature on Wednesday. She said: &quot;As the day went on he was starting to feel tired and a little achy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the field, we work long hours so thought maybe he just wasn't taking care of himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We sent him home to rest. He signed off, went home and called me later that evening with an elevated temperature.&quot; The rest of the crew, including Dr Snyderman, are also being flown back to the US by NBC and will be quarantined for 21 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in Washington DC a patient with potential symptoms of Ebola, who has recently been to Nigeria, was admitted Howard University Hospital and was said to be in a stable condition. A hospital spokesman said: &quot;We have activated the appropriate infection control protocols, including isolating the patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Dallas, Thomas Michael Duncan, 42, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on US soil, remained in a serious but stable condition in an isolation unit. He arrived in the country from Liberia on Sept 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the apartment where he was living in Dallas, his girlfriend Louise Troh, 36, her 13-year-old son and two grown-up nephews, were placed under armed guard to prevent them going outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five days after Mr Duncan was diagnosed, the bed sheets and towels on which he lay and which experts said could pose a danger remained in the apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A hazardous materials crew was due to collect them yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors fighting Ebola in one of Sierra Leone's biggest towns have said they are running out of basic supplies of medicine and protective clothing, despite promises of international aid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has said it is committed to boosting public health provision across Sierra Leone, building at least four new Ebola treatment facilities near urban centres, including one in Makeni, a large commercial hub about 120 miles north of the capital, Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with a 600% increase in cases, local health workers say they can't wait and are in desperate need of rudimentary supplies ranging from mattresses to paracetamol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have almost no protective equipment,&quot; said Adam Goguen, director of academic affairs at the University of Makeni. &quot;Hundreds of PPEs (personal protective equipment) a day are needed just to keep the primary holding centre stable. Our pharmacies are running out of medicine for even malaria and typhoid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Turay, a doctor at the Holy Spirit hospital in Makeni, said there was a desperate shortage of basic supplies, ranging from body bags for secure burials to examination gloves, to mattresses and pain relief tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed for donations of surgical spirits, bin bags, alcohol gel and hard protective boots from size five to eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no hospital treatment for Ebola in the area, but patients are put in a temporary holding centre before onward travel to Kenema, a city two hours away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in the holding centres is becoming desperate, as patients receive no care and Kenema is not accepting all the confirmed patients for treatment. But if we do not isolate them now we will lose all control,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a conference in London yesterday, experts said five people an hour were becoming infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone. As the epidemic escalates, international aid is barely able to keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sr Mary Sweney, who runs a local school, said she was concerned about the numbers of children left without parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef, the UN's children's agency, said 3,700 children, some as young as three and four years old, were mourning dead parents and were in urgent need of support as they felt &quot;unwanted and even abandoned&quot; by frightened and suspicious relatives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors fighting Ebola in one of Sierra Leone's biggest towns have said they are running out of basic supplies of medicine and protective clothing, despite promises of international aid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has said it is committed to boosting public health provision across Sierra Leone, building at least four new Ebola treatment facilities near urban centres, including one in Makeni, a large commercial hub about 120 miles north of the capital, Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with a 600% increase in cases, local health workers say they can't wait and are in desperate need of rudimentary supplies ranging from mattresses to paracetamol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have almost no protective equipment,&quot; said Adam Goguen, director of academic affairs at the University of Makeni. &quot;Hundreds of PPEs (personal protective equipment) a day are needed just to keep the primary holding centre stable. Our pharmacies are running out of medicine for even malaria and typhoid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Turay, a doctor at the Holy Spirit hospital in Makeni, said there was a desperate shortage of basic supplies, ranging from body bags for secure burials to examination gloves, to mattresses and pain relief tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed for donations of surgical spirits, bin bags, alcohol gel and hard protective boots from size five to eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no hospital treatment for Ebola in the area, but patients are put in a temporary holding centre before onward travel to Kenema, a city two hours away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation in the holding centres is becoming desperate, as patients receive no care and Kenema is not accepting all the confirmed patients for treatment. But if we do not isolate them now we will lose all control,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a conference in London yesterday, experts said five people an hour were becoming infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone. As the epidemic escalates, international aid is barely able to keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sr Mary Sweney, who runs a local school, said she was concerned about the numbers of children left without parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef, the UN's children's agency, said 3,700 children, some as young as three and four years old, were mourning dead parents and were in urgent need of support as they felt &quot;unwanted and even abandoned&quot; by frightened and suspicious relatives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">SO BEING NEUROTIC IN MIDDLE AGE IS LINKED TO DEMENTIA? THANKS - THAT'S ANOTHER THING FOR ME TO WORRY ABOUT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY TOM UTLEY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1209 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORRIES, worries, worries. Are we getting sucked into a Third World War in the Middle East? Will my wife ever find a hat she's happy with, to go with the outfit she's chosen for our son's wedding three weeks from tomorrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is global warming destroying the planet? Did I lock the back door before I left for work? Is that nasty tickle in my throat just a tickle, or the first sign of something more serious Ebola, perhaps, or the Big C?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this and, if the opinion polls are right, the Great Miliband Terror will be upon us in just seven months' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now along comes another thought to frighten us neurotics out of our wits: those who worry a lot in middle age, finds a study this week from the University of Gothenburg, are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as people who take life in their stride. That's all I need.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I go further, I should say that the research applied only to women, 800 of whom were questioned about their neuroticism and monitored over 38 years. But this brings me to my other big worry of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unmanly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you take the tests in Tuesday's paper, designed to establish whether you have a male or female brain? I did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As instructed, I clasped my hands in front of me, interlocking my fingers, and looked to see which thumb was on top. In my case, it was the right one an indication of femininity, apparently. Uh, oh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, I examined the relative lengths of my ring and index fingers. My right hand is reassuringly masculine, I was happy to discover, since my (ringless) ring finger was marginally the longer of the two. But as for the left, though there is very little in it, I have to admit that it was marginally on the girly side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the clincher. We were asked to examine photographs of four pairs of eyes and identify which moods they revealed. Women tend to be better at this, we're told, since they are much more sensitive than men to other people's feelings. I plumped for: a) concerned; b) doubtful; c) uneasy; d) interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crikey! Four out of four correct! I've never been more disconcerted to score top marks in an exam. Does this mean that for the past 60 years, without knowing it, I've been wandering around with a female brain trapped in a male body male, that is, apart from the ring finger on my left hand and a dominant right thumb?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must say I've never felt particularly womanly. It's true that I'm not much interested in sport, while I've confessed before to a decidedly unmanly love of ironing. But surely plenty of all-male, testosterone-charged blokes share my take-it-or-leave-it attitude to sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for ironing, it may not be very masculine, but it can hardly be described as a feminine pleasure either; I, for one, have never met a woman who claimed to enjoy it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, when I confessed in print that I found ironing strangely therapeutic and rewarding, I had floods of letters from women readers (well, three) inviting me round to their place to indulge my pleasure with their weekly washes to my heart's content. It's the nearest I've come to feeling as much in demand with the fairer sex as George Clooney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the possible exceptions of preferring ironing to the European Cup, and Jane Austen to the sports pages, I'd always reckoned I had a pretty standard set of male attributes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm good at parking and map-reading, fascinated by useless facts (did you know that St John's Wood is the only station on the London Underground whose name contains no letter from the word mackerel'?), brilliant at throwing scrunched up pieces of paper into the bin from a distance of several yards, hate talking on the phone, spend my lunchtimes outside the pub, leering furtively at women way out of my class, never tidy up, never listen to a word my wife says to me, always leave the loo seat up... oh, and I'm bored to tears by George Clooney's wedding and I don't give a damn what, if anything, has happened to Nigella's face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conspiring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This makes me all man, I would have thought. But we can't argue with science, the configuration of our fingers and thumbs or our ability to distinguish horror from affection in the look of a woman's eyes. Which brings me back to the anxiety I mentioned above: do we men who have female brains, and a tendency to worry, face the same doubled risk of dementia as women who suffer stress and anxiety at my age?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, heaven knows there are quite enough pressure groups and experts of one sort or another conspiring to drive us out of our minds. Indeed, in a cursory flip through yesterday's papers alone, I counted at least ten brand new things to be worried about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, so many family doctors are about to retire, warned the ever-alarmist Royal College of GPs, that more than 500 surgeries could close in England over the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was the news that tracker phone apps could leave children vulnerable to sexual predators (though since the advice came from the former MI6 chief Sir John Scarlett, who signed off Tony Blair's Iraq War dossier on weapons of mass destruction, we can possibly take it with a pinch of salt).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, we were told that Britain is in the grip of the worst moth infestation ever, UK manufacturing growth is running out of steam, migrant shanty towns are springing up in suburban parks, our clothes could give us bad backs, we're running out of phone numbers again, DVD sellers are nervous that our children could pick up racist ideas from watching Tom And Jerry cartoons, Sainsbury's dividend is at risk and timing of new deal could spell danger' (I can't tell you what deal or what danger, since this headline was on the sports pages, and, therefore, I read no further).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarmist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to mention the scary finding from the University of Chicago that losing our sense of smell and the ability to identify the scents of fish, rose, leather, orange and peppermint could mean that we will die within five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who had a surreptitious sniff of a shoe and an orange yesterday morning, just to make sure (or perhaps I was the only one, which may be yet another thing to worry about).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, let's face it, we worry far too much these days. Ebola? What's the betting that it will go the way of swine flu, bird flu, salmonella-ridden eggs, mad cow disease and Sars, all of which were predicted to wipe out huge swathes of the population, but somehow didn't?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global warming? Even if it's happening, it may not be half as bad as the alarmists say. And anyway, worrying about it in Britain, and wasting billions on useless wind farms, won't help. Not while China and India belch out ever increasing tonnages of greenhouse gases every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Third World War? If only we'd worried less about Saddam Hussein's imaginary WMD, and the authoritarian regimes in Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt and Syria, it might have been a whole lot less likely. So perhaps we should try worrying a bit less about the savages of the Islamic State, whose clapped-out Toyotas we're blasting to smithereens with missiles costing &pound;200,000 a pop. I can't believe it's helping much, can you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the sake of retaining our marbles, I reckon we should fret only over the really serious matters we can do something about such as keeping Mr Miliband out of No 10 and finding a suitable wedding hat for my wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ebola virus could become airborne if the epidemic is not brought under control quickly enough, the chief of the United Nations Ebola mission warned yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anthony Banbury, the UN secretarygeneral's special representative, said aid workers were racing against time to bring the epidemic under control in case the virus mutated and became even harder to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The longer it moves around in human hosts in the virulent melting pot that is west Africa, the more chances increase that it could mutate,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a nightmare scenario [that it could become airborne], and unlikely, but it can't be ruled out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He admitted that the international community had been &quot;a bit late&quot; to respond to the epidemic, but that it was &quot;not too late&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Banbury, who has worked with the UN since 1988, said that the epidemic was the worst disaster he had witnessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In a career working in these kinds of situations, wars, natural disasters - I have never seen anything as serious or dangerous or high risk as this one,&quot; he said. I've heard other people saying this as well - seniorfigures who are not being alarmist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But other health officials pointed out that no virus transmitted by bodily fluids - as Ebola is - had ever mutated to airborne transmission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has never been a virus transmitted in this manner that converts to a respiratory virus, and there is no evidence that this has ever occurred in the epidemiology,&quot; said Prof David Heymann, chairman of Public Health England at a discussion programme on the virus in London on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He mentioned HIV and Hepatitis B as example of viruses transmitted by bodily fluids that had &quot;never converted to a respiratory virus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, added that a sense of proportion should be kept when discussing Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The chances of Ebola becoming airborne are extremely small. I am not aware of any viral infection changing its mode of transmission. It's important we retain a sense of proportion and not exaggerate the risks for it changing and becoming airborne,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is already enough fear and panic surrounding this epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night, it was confirmed that up to 100 people may have been exposed to Thomas Duncan, America's first Ebola patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Duncan, 42, a Liberian citizen who was visiting relations in Dallas, was seen vomiting in the street two days after he had been sent home from a hospital following a blunder by medical staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had gone to the hospital on Sept 26 and told a nurse he had arrived from Liberia a week earlier, but the information was not passed on. Mr Duncan's girlfriend, who has been quarantined inside her Texas home with three other people, criticised the hospital and said the sheets and towels he used have still not been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was avoiding the bed and sleeping in the living room instead. She told CNN: &quot;I don't know what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In London yesterday, Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, held a conference gathering ministers, diplomats and health officials from around 20 countries to secure more funding in the fight against Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain has pledged &pound;125million to help build an estimated 700 treatment beds, fund new community treatment centres, support existing public health services and support aid agencies in Sierra Leone. Ernest Bai Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, had been due to attend but his plane broke down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US government is scrambling to start production of the experimental Ebola drug that is viewed as the most promising treatment in the fight against the virus. The ZMapp serum was used to treat two American missionaries who recovered from Ebola but is not available for Mr Duncan as the limited supplies ran out in August. ZMapp's development was repeatedly held up for years by funding delays from a Pentagon programme aimed at countering biological threats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spread of the Ebola virus reads like the script of a horror film. The first cases of the outbreak were spotted in Guinea in December last year. By June 2014, when Doctors Without Borders issued a plea for international assistance, it was spreading throughout west Africa. This week, a man was diagnosed with Ebola in a hospital in Texas - the first case outside west Africa. One UN official has offered a thankfully unlikely scenario of the virus becoming airborne.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The advance of Ebola reflects the inequality of human society. Here in the developed world we can put our faith in sophisticated institutions to stem the spread. In Africa that is not the case. Ebola has done so much damage there because much of African society is not equipped to cope. The condition of hospitals is appalling: many lack soap or running water, and doctors are hopelessly outnumbered by patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West has responded. The US has sent a military team and the UK has pledged a further &pound;20 million to provide vital medical supplies administered by skilled clinicians. But, according to the Commons international development committee, we could be reaping the consequences of overlooking the needs of the &quot;least developed&quot; countries in favour of those that are more &quot;high profile&quot;. The committee accuses the European Union of failing to act when millions of dollars of aid was not passed on from the Liberian Ministry of Finance to its Ministry of Health. Likewise, it calls the UK's decision to terminate further funding to the Liberia and Sierra Leone health sectors &quot;unwise&quot;. Given the scale of this crisis, the West certainly cannot afford to take any action that smacks of miserliness or turning a blind eye to intolerable conditions. It is in all our interests to control this horror - a cause that ought to unite north and south, rich and poor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE Ebola virus could become airborne if the epidemic is not brought under control quickly enough, the chief of the UN Ebola mission warned yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Banbury, the UN secretarygeneral's special representative, said aid workers were racing against time to bring the epidemic under control in case the virus mutated and became even harder to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The longer it moves around in human hosts in the virulent melting pot that is west Africa, the more chances increase that it could mutate,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a nightmare scenario [that it could become airborne], and unlikely, but it can't be ruled out.&quot; He admitted that the international community had been &quot;a bit late&quot; to respond to the epidemic, but that it was &quot;not too late&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Banbury, who has worked with the UN since 1988, said that the epidemic was the worst disaster he had witnessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a career working in these kinds of situations, wars, natural disasters - I have never seen anything as serious or dangerous or high risk as this one,&quot; he said. &quot;I've heard other people saying this as well - seniorfigures who are not being alarmist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other health officials pointed out that no virus transmitted by bodily fluids - as Ebola is - had ever mutated to airborne transmission. &quot;There has never been a virus transmitted in this manner that converts to a respiratory virus, and there is no evidence that this has ever occurred in the epidemiology,&quot; said Prof David Heymann, chairman of Public Health England at a discussion programme on the virus in London on Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned HIV and Hepatitis B as examples of viruses transmitted by bodily fluids that had &quot;never converted to a respiratory virus&quot;. Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, added that a sense of proportion should be kept when discussing Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chances of Ebola becoming airborne are extremely small. I am not aware of any viral infection changing its mode of transmission. It's important we retain a sense of proportion and not exaggerate the risks for it changing and becoming airborne,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is already enough fear and panic surrounding this epidemic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, it was confirmed that up to 100 people may have been exposed to Thomas Duncan, America's first Ebola patient. Mr Duncan, 42, a Liberian citizen who was visiting relations in Dallas, was seen vomiting in the street two days after he had been sent home from a hospital following a blunder by medical staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had gone to the hospital on Sept 26 and told a nurse he had arrived from Liberia a week earlier, but the information was not passed on. Mr Duncan's girlfriend, who has been quarantined inside her Texas home with three other people, criticised the hospital and said the sheets and towels he used have still not been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was avoiding the bed and sleeping in the living room instead. She told CNN: &quot;I don't know what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia is reported to be planning to prosecute Mr Duncan, alleging that he lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London yesterday, Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, held a conference gathering ministers, diplomats and health officials from around 20 countries to secure more funding in the fight against Ebola. Britain has pledged &pound;125million to help build an estimated 700 treatment beds, fund new community treatment centres, support existing public health services and support aid agencies in Sierra Leone. Ernest Bai Koroma, the president of Sierra Leone, had been due to attend but his plane broke down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US government is scrambling to start production of the experimental Ebola drug that is viewed as the most promising treatment in the fight against the virus. The ZMapp serum was used to treat two American missionaries who recovered from Ebola but is not available for Mr Duncan as the limited supplies ran out in August. ZMapp's development was repeatedly held up for years by funding delays from a Pentagon programme aimed at countering biological threats.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is spreading at the rate of five new cases an hour in Sierra Leone, according to figures released as world leaders and experts on disease control gathered in London yesterday to discuss the outbreak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures from Save the Children showed there were 765 new cases last week in the west African country alone, but only 327 hospital beds to treat infected patients. The charity said the &quot;terrifying&quot; rate of the spread of the disease was outstripping medical supplies and threatened a breakdown of Sierra Leone's already fragile health system. The rate of spread of the deadly virus is projected to double to 10 people an hour in the country before the end of October, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN said the spread of the disease in neighbouring Liberia was just as alarming and called for a massive international response to prevent the outbreak wreaking havoc in west Africa and beyond. Speaking from Liberia, Anthony Banbury, head of a new UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, said: &quot;It is fairly similar in Liberia. The disease is spreading very rapidly - cases doubling every 20 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Banbury said: &quot;The disease has reached every county of Liberia. It is clear that the international community has to have a rapid and very strong response to get this disease under control before it wreaks much more massive havoc in these countries and possibly other ones.&quot; The first patient to be diagnosed with Ebola outside of Africa told medical staff in the US that he had recently travelled to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save the Children's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: &quot;We need a coordinated international response that ensures treatment centres are built and staffed immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain yesterday hosted a conference at Lancaster House to discuss the international response to the outbreak. The foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and international development secretary, Justine Greening, were joined by representatives of five African countries and 10 other nations including the US and Cuba, which is sending 300 doctors and nurses. UN organisations, charities, the British actor Idris Elba and William Pooley, the British nurse who recently recovered from Ebola, were also present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK has invested &pound;125m in the fight against Ebola, including the promise of 700 additional beds, and 400 NHS staff have volunteered to go out to help staff them and train local people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LACC has therefore requested the National Ebola Task Force to furnish the list of all monetary contributions and payments made to the National Ebola Trust Fund, along with information of all other related resources. Additionally, the Commission has entreated the National Ebola Task Force to provide a full list of all administrators of Ebola resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the LACC informs the public that it is investigating alleged acts of impropriety involving some members of the National Legislature and a Consultant regarding a contract to review the Petroleum Law of Liberia.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LACC will appropriately inform the public about the outcome of this investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article being published by this paper today, Madam Catakaw said, &quot;This is the worst time for education in Liberia. This is the worst time because the Ebola virus has infected so many people that all our schools and learning facilities have all closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can use this worst time in education to begin our best in education. Let us use this time to put things in the right perspective and plan for a dynamic educational program for Liberia,&quot; Mrs. Catakaw averred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also alarmed over the issue of decentralization of educational activities which according to her, is a paramount concern to the nation's educational sector and tat decentralizing the educational sector of Liberia is worth more important to the country's future generation than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have spoken with so many people on this aspect of decentralization. We must decentralize education in Liberia now! One hundred and sixty seven (167) years of centralized education in Liberia has not worked,&quot; Madam Hester Williams Catakaw stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Deputy Education Minister in her analysis also stressed the importance of early childhood education which according to her will serve as a foundation to the building of a well firmed educational foundation for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madam Catakaw said she has been on record since 2008, explaining to fellow colleagues and stakeholders in the Liberian educational sector the importance of early child education for Liberia. According to her, the process, if achieved, should be a mandate of the Ministry of Education and should not be situated at the Ministry of Education premises itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then stressed the need of revisiting the current National Curriculum of the Ministry of Education for Liberian schools. &quot;Look at your National Curriculum; it is not harmonized with the West Africa Secondary Schools Certificate Exams (WASSCE),&quot; Madam Catakaw stated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia (GOL) has threatened to prosecute Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian who was recently diagnosed of the deadly Ebola virus four days after arriving in the United States. The GOL said its action to prosecute Mr. Duncan after he recovery from the virus stands from the fact that he made false declaration while filling in the health form at the Robert International Airport (RIA) prior to his departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the daily Ebola Press briefing yesterday at the Ministry of Information, RIA Board Chairman, Mr. BinyahKesselly said Mr. Duncan knew that he had Ebola even though his temperature after undergoing the test at the airport registered 36.5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kesselly told journalists that Mr. Duncan who lived in the 72nd Community in Paynesville prior to traveling to the United States had an interaction with a pregnant lady in his community who died from Ebola after being refused by several hospitals and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RIA Board Chair said Mr. Duncan took the woman with his bare hands and put her into a taxi before taking her around to hospitals and clinics that refused her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kesselly said he had conversation with the Minister of Justice and had a lengthy discussion with her relative to whether Mr. Duncan can be prosecuted for giving the airport false declaration after knowing that he had had an encounter with a sick person or someone who had died of the Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very unfortunate that Mr. Duncan could give false declaration at the airport knowing that he had an interaction with a person who died of Ebola. This is against the public health Law of Liberia,&quot; Mr. Kesselly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RIA Board Chairman who is also the Commissioner of the Liberia Maritime Authority said that the screening of passengers going through the airport is conducted in three phases starting from the gate, to entering into the airport terminal and later before boarding the aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr. Duncan went through all of those screening but did not show any sign of temperature elevation but upon arrival in the United States on September 20, 2014 he came down with Ebola four days later, knowing that he interacted with some who died of Ebola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kesselly said from July 26 to October 1 2014, the RIA had tested or screened 9,624 who had travelled out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RIA Board Chairman said the board made a commitment that within every 48 hours, the airport updates its screening measures and noted that when one has a temperature elevation of 37.5 he or she is quizzed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In instituting our stringent measures, Chairman Kesselly said the airport is working along with agents of the Center For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who are always on a rotational basis and we continue to hold training, workshop and other capacity building programs for our staff at the airport,&quot; Mr. Kesselly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the RIA Management will be working with the National Ebola Task Force especially the Ebola Case Management Team headed by Tolbert Nyenswah to make the list of those identified in contact tracing, suspected Ebola infected persons and those infected with the virus to the Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this will help the airport in ensuring that no infected person will give the RIA false declaration when they are traveling out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kesselly also called on the public to give information about people who are about to travel as this will go along in stopping the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kesselly said if this kind of situation continues with people giving false declaration, people could be quarantined for twenty-one days before travelling, saying, &quot;This will not augur well if one had to attend a conference or seminar abroad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia Medical and Dental Council (LMDC) is today beginning the investigation of two medical centers in the country following several complaints that they are rejecting patients. LMDC's Dr. John Mulbah said the council had information that a woman in pain was recently taken to the JFK Hospital but was refused admission and subsequently delivered in the waiting room of the hospital's maternity ward coupled with the information about the daughter of Representative Edward Forh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Mulbah said the council will also investigate the incident at the Benson Hospital when a pregnant woman was rejected and had to deliver in the open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LMDC official, addressing the daily Ebola News conference at the Information Ministry yesterday said all those that were on shift when the incidents occurred at the Benson Hospital and the JFK will be called for investigation beginning today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He informed journalists that if anyone is found liable, his or her license to practice will be suspended or revoked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LMDC is not only concerned about the well-being of health workers but the entire populace; that is why they are always available at the various hospitals and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Mulbah said many persons are dying from curable diseases because they are being rejected by health care workers, saying, &quot;If you are caught in this process of rejecting or refusing sick people you will be investigated. We took oath to restore or protect lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Dr. Mulbah has commended the Government of Liberia (GOL) for preparing a risk package for health workers and other added benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then appealed to the GOL to reinstate the two leaders of the Health Workers who were dismissed during a recent go slow action by health workers prior to Ebola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BCAE Steering Committee Chairman, Mr. Kederick Johnson, said the workshops, which are being conducted in consultation with the County Heath Team and Ebola Task Force, will train or upgrade the health workers' knowledge and skills to perform contact tracing, surveillance and community education in the county to help curb the spread of Ebola. The workshops will be conducted by Ugandan doctors and Bomi County health care professionals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with reporters at the James Spriggsfield Airport in Monrovia yesterday, Mr. Banbury said his team in Liberia will focus on four main issues by working with the health sector to know what they can do to quickly stop the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stated that President Sirleaf along with the Presidents of Sierra Leone and Guinea wrote the United Nations to help end the Ebola crisis that is causing chaos in their respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that logistic is one of the challenges health workers are face with and UNMEER will fill in the gap by providing transportation.An other point of focus will be community awareness and prevention, let communities know how deadly the virus is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He mentioned that the Ebola virus is a threat to the international community and because of the threat this is the first and fastest ever emergency response team put together by the United Nations. He stressed that they will focus on saving lives because a lot of Liberians have succumbed to the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the head of UNMEER in Liberia, Robert Ragan said lots of good work have been done by the health workers in Liberia and that even though the Ebola crisis is very difficult but UNMEER will do all it could to stop the virus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">851 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) embarks on a program to monitor and make sure that adequate internal controls and systems are instituted in the administration of Ebola money and other resources, Lofa County Senator George Tengbeh is equally demanding that the Legislature commission its Public Account Committee to conduct an audit aimed at account for the initial five million United States dollars approved by the Legislature to fight the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, however, the LACC announces an investigation into misconduct on the part of some legislators and others entrusted with resources intended for the anti-Ebola drive in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a dispatch, the LACC said its stance is an effort to ensure transparency, accountability and integrity in the management of Ebola resources, a reason for which the Commission has embarked on a monitoring program that would make sure that adequate internal controls and systems are instituted in the administration of said resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LACC, the dispatch indicated, has therefore requested the National Ebola Task Force to furnish the list of all monetary contributions and payments made to the National Ebola Trust Fund, along with information of all other related resources. Additionally, the Commission has entreated the National Ebola Task Force to provide a full list of all administrators of Ebola resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the LACC has also informed the public that it is investigating alleged acts of impropriety involving some members of the National Legislature and a Consultant regarding a contract to review the Petroleum Law of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission hereby assures the public that the investigation will be conducted with the utmost degree of professionalism. Accordingly, the LACC said it will appropriately inform the public about the outcome of this investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, Lofa County Senator George Tengbeh is demanding an audit to be conducted to account for the initial five million United States dollars approved by the Legislature to fight the deadly Ebola virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lofa County lawmaker is of the opinion that there is no responsibility, without accountability, noting that although the amount has been expended and report has been made, it contingent upon the Legislature to commission an audit to verify expenditures alluded to in the reports regarding the use of the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audit, Senator Tengbeh, indicated, will to prove a high level of responsibility on the part of government and will induce a high level of accountability to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Ebola virus intensified its deadly battle against Liberians in late July of this year, the Liberian Legislature approved US$5 million for the Executive Branch of the Government to use in fighting the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount disbursed to the National Ebola task force headed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as a sign of government's commitment to fight Ebola out of Liberia In an interviewed with reporters at the Capitol Building after submitting a communication to Senate Plenary seeking that body's approval of an audit to account for the use of the US$5 million, the senator noted that a successful audit is a sign of government upholding the principles of responsibility and accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lofa County Senator Tengbeh said if the Executive Branch of the government must demonstrate the spirit of a regime of responsibility and accountability, the Senate should ensure that the money given to the Special Ebola Taskforce for the fight against the Ebola virus is accounted for. In his understanding, this level of responsibility and accountability cannot be achieved without an audit into the use of the amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount disbursed to the Executive must be accounted for and that could only be done or achieve through an audit with the Liberian senate Public Account Committee playing a major role in the process, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the Senate Plenary should mandate the Public Account Committee to invite all of those government agencies and ministries that have received monies from the Ebola Taskforce in the name of fighting the Ebola virus in the country so as to prove to Liberians and the international community that the government is more responsible and accountable to its people and donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Tengbeh further indicated that one of the main reasons for which he's calling for an audit in the Ebola US$5 million dished out for the national drive against Ebola is to straighten the spirit of coordination and oversight responsibility of the national legislature and that of the Executive Branch of Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money received and expended by the government, Sen. George Tengbeh said, has to be accounted for because it came from the people of Liberia, the business community in the country and international partners to assist the Liberians in fighting the Ebola virus out of Liberia, he emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded that until an audit is conducted, the Liberian government will not demonstrate the role of a government that focus on being more responsible and accountable to the people and its partners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) has commenced the process for the selection and appointment of an independent &quot;Fiduciary Agent&quot; to assist the government with the financial management of the Ebola Trust Fund.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An MFDP release says the decision to contract an independent financial management firm was intended to uphold the government's commitment to full transparency and accountability as announced recently by Liberia's Minister of Finance and Development Planning, Amara Konneh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Minister Konneh, the firm selected to provide the fiduciary service would manage the fund and supervise accounting related services, under the direction of the Minister of Finance and Development Planning, under the multi-donor governance structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be required to set up a sound financial management system to accurately record and report on all funds received and disbursed from the Trust Fund and providing a regular fund management report. The firm would also provide oversight of all procurement functions to ensure compliance with established guidelines of the government as well as those of development partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working with sector entities, the Firm would work to design specific procurement procedures and rules tailored to meet the standard guidelines of Public Procurement and Concession Commission. The firm would amongst others, provide technical support to the Incident Management System and oversee the procurement of goods, works, non-consulting services and (services) to be funded from the ETF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Liberia in response to the Ebola Virus epidemic established the Ebola Trust Fund (ETF) at the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) in a bid to attract resources from the government, private citizens and international donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fund was created with an initial US$5 million injection through a loan facility from the Central Bank of Liberia. To date, the fund has raised over 10 million dollars, with more donations expected from foreign partners and friendly governments in coming weeks. Recently the Liberian government announced it needed US $ 375 million to effectively fund its National Ebola Response and Restoration of Basic Health Services strategy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BMJ claims that the mayhem' it will inflict on future generations will make deaths from the ebola outbreak pale into insignificance'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bizarre move, the journal has set aside 11 pages of this week's issue to warn doctors of the dire consequences of global warming - without any obvious relevance to medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics described the article as alarmist' and desperate'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a separate commentary, the BMJ's editor Dr Fiona Godlee defends the piece by saying doctors must understand the problem if they are to help tackle it. It is not the first time the publication - formerly known as the British Medical Journal - and its editor have spoken out on such a highly charged issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, it carried a piece calling for doctors to be allowed to help the terminally ill to die - prompting concern among medics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her most recent comments, Dr Godlee warns that seven million people die worldwide every year due to pollution and this will only increase if greenhouse gas emissions - which cause global warming - rise further. She points out that reducing these emissions by walking rather than using the car will have added benefits of reducing obesity, heart disease and diabetes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she calls on the World Health Organisation to declare the issue a public health emergency - putting it on a par with the current ebola outbreak in West Africa which has claimed 3,000 lives since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deaths from ebola infection, tragic and frightening though they are, will pale into insignificance when compared with the mayhem we can expect for our children and grandchildren if the world does nothing to check its carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And action is needed now,' the article concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the average global temperature had risen by 0.5C in 50 years. They predicted that over the next century temperatures will increase by 3C causing a rise in sea levels, flooding, disease outbreaks and, as a result, mass migration of refugees. Politicians are striving to reach an international agreement by December next year on legally-binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It would aim to limit global warming to just 2C, and will replace the Kyoto Protocol which came into effect in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the last attempt at a deal, at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, ended in disaster, and many politicians are worried about a similar result this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Forum, a think-tank founded by former Chancellor Lord Lawson, accused the BMJ report of being needlessly alarmist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: The World Health Organisation would become a global laughing stock if they were to follow the ridiculously over-the-top demands of a green alarmist editor. There is a real disconnect between what they are saying and the reality.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the article was just desperate', saying: The smaller the chance of an international agreement, the more desperate they get.'</SPAN></P>
